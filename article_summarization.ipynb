       "'\"It has brought us to the breaking point,\" one hospital official said. In January, Alaska had the highest per capita coronavirus vaccination rate in the nation. Now, hospitals are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, and the states largest hospital is rationing care. Vaccine hesitancy and the delta variant have pushed the states fragile and limited hospital system to the breaking point. Providence Alaska Medical Center, the states largest hospital, released a letter to the public Tuesday saying that more than 30% of its patients have COVID-19 and the hospital is rationing treatment. \"While we are doing our utmost, we are no longer able to provide the standard of care to each and every patient who needs our help,\" wrote Chief of Staff Kristen Solana Walkinshaw on behalf of the hospitals Medical Executive Committee. \"The acuity and number of patients now exceeds our resources and our ability to staff beds with skilled caregivers, like nurses and respiratory therapists.\" Of Alaska\\'s 120 ICU beds, 106 were filled as of Thursday -- leaving only 14 beds available statewide. Alaska had a strong initial vaccine rollout, delivering doses to remote areas of the state by helicopters, planes, dog sleds and ferries, with additional support from the Indian Health Service and state tribal health system to vaccinate Alaska Natives. Due to the challenges posed by the states vast size, it received vaccine allocations monthly as opposed to weekly, giving it the ability to plan ahead and deliver many doses early on. But, as in the rest of the country, vaccination rates slowly began dropping off over the summer, stagnating with 56.7% of Alaskans fully vaccinated as of Thursday, according to the states coronavirus dashboard. \"In terms of why things went stagnant, it does seem like hesitancy is the main factor behind that,\" said Jared Kosin, CEO and president of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association. \"It\\'s not an access issue. The vaccine\\'s widely available in Alaska anywhere.\" Gov. Mike Dunleavy ended Alaskas COVID-19 emergency declaration in the spring, and both the state legislature and Dunleavys administration have yet to reinstate one even at the pleading of hospitals and doctors. In a spring mayoral race, Anchorage voters elected Dave Bronson, who has repeatedly said his administration will not enact citywide mask or vaccine mandates. Bronson reiterated that commitment on Tuesday after an assembly meeting where hospital workers begged for action. Cases in Alaska have been sharply increasing since August, and the state shattered its new daily case record with 1,068 infections reported Wednesday. As a result, hospitalizations have skyrocketed, reaching all time highs. And health care experts warn this is only the beginning of a surge that could last weeks. \"It has brought us to the breaking point, and to be totally direct, in many respects we are broken,\" said Kosin. \"The situation is extremely bleak.\" Alaska runs on a \"hub-and-spoke model\" of health care, according to Kosin. \"If you\\'re in a more rural area, you\\'re going to go to clinics, rural hospitals,\" he told ABC News. \"The idea is, as you need a higher level of care or (have) more needs, you will transfer in, ultimately, to our biggest hub, which is Anchorage.\" Anchorage, the states most populous city, is home to the states three largest hospitals -- some of which offer the only advanced neurological and cardiovascular care in the state. While many people live in rural and geographically isolated areas, those communities still rely on the specialty medical care that can only be found in the city. As city hospitals have reached capacity and Anchorage residents are forced to remain in their cars or emergency room waiting areas until they can receive care, health care institutions must refuse transfer patients from rural communities, leaving them without what can be lifesaving treatment, Solana Walkinshaw said. The nearest next option are hospitals in the contiguous U.S. like Seattle, Washington -- an over three-hour flight away. Seattle is also experiencing an influx of COVID-19 patients and is trying to help by taking patients from neighboring states like Idaho, which is coping with its most serious surge in cases since the beginning of the pandemic. That leaves very limited options. Because city hospitals are inundated with COVID-19 cases, they are struggling to provide routine care and emergency services to patients who do not have the virus. As of Tuesday night, Providence Alaska Medical Center had only a single available bed with 10 admitted patients in need of one, along with patients in the emergency room also waiting for an opening, Solana Walkinshaw said. Three of those patients needed an ICU bed, but the hospital had none available. Between 80-85% of COVID-19 patients at the hospital are unvaccinated and the same is true of the COVID-19 patients who die, according to Providence Alaska Medical Center spokesperson Mikal Canfield. The hospital began rationing care Saturday, leaving health care workers to decide which patients get care and which ones have to wait. The staff is demoralized, Solana Walkinshaw said, with some breaking down in tears, sad and frustrated over the situation they find themselves in. \"People are struggling, working as hard as they can and having to make these decisions is probably some of the hardest things people have done in their careers,\" she said. While rural Alaska has experienced a stark increase in coronavirus cases, with some communities seeing the worst outbreaks on record, rural health providers are not being hit as hard with COVID-19 patients, Kosin said. That\\'s due to the smaller populations outside of the city, the fact that the COVID-19 patients in the most serious condition are sent to Anchorage and because some of the villages have very high vaccination rates. The bigger problem for rural institutions is that they are being tasked with caring for non-COVID-19 patients they would typically transfer to Anchorage. At Tuesday\\'s city assembly meeting, a group of health care workers from hospitals across Anchorage pleaded for residents to wear masks and get vaccinated. Leslie Gonsette, an internal medicine hospitalist at Providence Alaska Medical Center, came to testify at the meeting during her hospital shift. One of her patients, who does not have COVID-19 and is vaccinated, was in critical condition and in need of an ICU bed, she said. \"I called my colleagues in the ICU, and I explained, \\'My patient is going to probably die. I need an ICU bed,\\'\" she said. \"And the answer I got was, \\'We are doing our best. We do not have a bed.\\'\" Bronsons office released a statement after the meeting. \"My administration has been clear since the beginning that we will not mandate masks or vaccines,\" it said. \"If someone wants to wear a mask or get a vaccination that\\'s their personal choice. But we will not violate the privacy and independent health care decisions of our citizens in the process.\" Alaska\\'s health care providers, however, are left worrying about the kinds of choices they will be left with. \"Rationing care will take on a whole new meaning than it does today,\" Kosin said. \"I think it\\'s going to lead to the types of decisions you cant imagine a person having to make.\"\\n\\nAfter weeks of rising coronavirus infections and hospitalizations, there are signs that Alabama\\'s latest coronavirus surge may be starting to abate. However, the reprieve comes at a high cost -- with the state now experiencing a near record-breaking surge in virus-related deaths. \"We are seeing a decrease in the number of patients that are in the hospital, but unfortunately, it\\'s not because all of them are getting better and going home to their families... These patients are dying,\" Dr. Kierstin Kennedy, chief of hospital medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, told ABC News. Statewide, there are now more than 2,100 patients hospitalized with coronavirus, and intensive care unit capacity also remains tight, with 97% of ICU beds currently in use, according to federal data. Although numbers are now coming down, said Kennedy, this surge is different from the last one, because \"patients are so sick,\" and are thus requiring longer stays. \"A lot of our patients that are in the acute-care settings are getting worse and requiring the ICU. I think overall, the need for ICU beds remains high across the state,\" Kennedy added. Because more than 74% of the Alabama\\'s elderly population chose to be vaccinated, they have fared better throughout this latest surge, Kennedy said. However, this latest wave has also been a particularly disconcerting experience, she added, because the patient population is much younger, and primarily consisting of unvaccinated people. \"These patients are as sick if not sicker than elderly patients, they\\'re staying in the hospital longer and they\\'re dying at an alarming rate,\" Kennedy said. \"It\\'s unlike anything that I\\'ve seen.\" The new surge comes as recent data revealed that for the first time in Alabama\\'s history, there were more deaths than births in 2020. \"Here in Alabama, we continue to see deaths at a really high rate. ... 2020 is going to be the first year that we know of in the history of our state where we actually had more deaths than births -- our state literally shrunk in 2020,\" Alabama State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris reported during a press conference on Friday. In 2020, data showed that 64,714 Alabama residents died and only 57,641 were born. Even in World War II or the 1918 flu pandemic, there was never a time that deaths exceeded births, Harris added. \"It\\'s certainly possible that could happen this year as well if we continue at the same rate that we\\'re seeing now,\" Harris noted. Even as the situation shows signs of improvement, the country is entering flu season, and public health measures have been considerably relaxed in Alabama. \"At this point, we\\'re just kind of bracing ourselves, as we see the resumption of college football and people out in large numbers, and wondering how that is going to fare, as far as inpatient volumes both for COVID and for flu,\" Kennedy said. Additionally, Alabama has one of the country\\'s lowest vaccination rates, with just 41.6% of the state\\'s total population fully vaccinated, putting much of the state\\'s population still at-risk for severe infection. \"Unless we see a dramatic uptick in the number of people that get vaccinated, our concern is that we will do this again in just a few months. And every time we do it, it seems to get worse,\" Kennedy said. The ongoing crisis has left front-line workers frustrated, Kennedy said, admitting that she still does not see an end in sight. \"Watching people out in the community behave as though COVID is not an issue or that it\\'s over, is really -- it\\'s a really sharp contrast to what we\\'re seeing in the hospital and sometimes that\\'s very difficult to process,\" Kennedy said. \"We don\\'t have to be in these situations. We are choosing illness and death in a way that is just very unnatural.\"\\n\\nAngela McCray left her job as a pharmacist to homeschool her three children as pandemic lockdowns closed public schools in Monroe, North Carolina. So when public schools in the region announced reopening plans, she was excited to return her daughter for in-class instruction. But McCray became concerned when her school district -- Union County Public Schools -- didnt announce any official plans to test students or even require masks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. \"I was being patient knowing that they would see the numbers increase and would change their mind,\" she said. That never happened. In fact, the school district decided to roll back its quarantine and contract-tracing requirements for students with positive cases, citing the need to ease the workload of school staff. It was a move that shocked and angered parents. \"As a pharmacist, as a mother, I couldnt stand by and continue to watch that happen,\" McCray said. \"We had to start getting action in place to figure out how we can push our elected officials to step in and make some changes.\" The district only reversed course on its quarantine requirements when the state threatened to sue. But it still has no plans to offer COVID-19 testing to students or to require masks, despite both being recommended by public health officials. \"Testing is not offered by the school system, and it is offered within the county,\" said Tahira Stalberte, assistant superintendent for communications and community relations at Union County Public Schools. \"If anyone wants a test, they can call our local health department and they can get them a test.\" Six months after President Joe Biden offered states $10 billion so schools could routinely test students and staff to prevent asymptomatic cases, the school year is being hindered by the virus. Some 925,000 children have become infected since school began this fall, according to data collected by the American Academy of Pediatrics, a staggering spike that has pushed many more kids into quarantine. Some states have rejected their share of the $10 billion in federal funds for COVID-19 testing in schools while others have been painfully slow in actually implementing virus mitigation plans. A survey of the nations 100 largest school districts from the Center on Reinventing Public Education found that less than 15% of those schools are utilizing federal funding dollars to establish COVID-19 in-school screening programs. A spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department said the federal government has disbursed the funds. But when it comes to the utilization of those dollars, its up to the states to distribute the money to those that need it, including school districts. The options for school districts range from working with the state government to stand up a screening program, outsourcing the testing and screening process to a third party vendor, or completely overseeing the student testing process themselves, which many school administrators -- particularly in smaller districts -- have described as an impossible task without additional support. The challenges in implementing steady in-school testing and mitigation strategies have been particularly acute in the South and Midwest. Texas has reported more than 125,000 positive COVID-19 cases in the first month since schools in the state reopened. Now with the spike in student caseloads, many Texas school districts are rethinking their testing strategies in the hopes that immediate changes will keep schools open and curb spread of the virus. After two teachers working in the Connally Independent School District -- serving the Waco, Texas area -- died from coronavirus-related complications, masks were mandated for every student and staff member. The requirement placed the school district in direct opposition to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who signed legislation banning mask mandates. \"With the loss of two beloved teachers, we know that concerns for physical and mental health are heightened,\" said Wesley Holt, Connally ISD superintendent, in a memo to parents. \"We want to assure you that we are focused on measures to take care of our students and staff.\" As matters like testing and mask-wearing remain fraught, highly politicized issues, school districts that find themselves in disagreement with their governors on these matters have had to adopt a go-it-alone approach. Iowas Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds rejected $95 million in federal funds offered to the state for in-school coronavirus testing, complicating matters for school districts urgently looking for funding to establish testing. \"There is confusion about funds Iowa had available last year for testing and contact tracing supposedly being returned before school districts knew they were available,\" said Phillip Roeder, a Des Moines Public Schools spokesperson, of the states returned federal COVID-19 testing dollars. In one of the nations wealthiest counties, Fairfax County in northern Virginia, officials have been slow to establish any kind of formal testing regimen for students and staff. \"We are exploring a public-private partnership to offer testing and vaccinations across schools and expect to have more soon,\" said a Fairfax County Public Schools spokesperson in a statement. \"Our current layered mitigation strategy has meant that less than 0.2 % of our in-school student and staff population has been quarantined due to a COVID exposure.\" Some school districts that have been slow to implement systematic testing have found themselves in the difficult position of choosing between overseeing the logistics of managing a COVID-19 screening programs at the beginning of a new school year or involving third-party vendors to manage them. \"In many states, there are a number of different testing vendors they [schools] can choose from,\" said Leah Perkinson, manager of the pandemics division at the Rockefeller Foundation. \"One of the most unfortunate parts about all of this is that there is a ton of guidance out there, but theres just not a lot of awareness about what the choices are.\" The New Orleans Public School system utilizes a testing program through the Louisiana Department of Health, in which students and their families can go to more than 91 school-based sites to get free routine COVID-19 PCR tests and receive results in under 24 hours. The school district, which serves over 44,000 students, gives schools the choice of opting into the testing program, but some schools within the district have decided its more appropriate to mandate testing. Overall, New Orleans school officials say participation in the testing program has shown promise, especially given an unnaturally busy hurricane season. \"We believe that following Hurricane Ida, it has actually boosted participation,\" said Morgan Ripski, COVID-19 testing coordinator for New Orleans Public Schools. \"The vast majority of our schools were not yet reopened, but what they did was open their sites as testing centers so students and parents could get tested before returning to the classroom.\" In the first few days after Hurricane Ida hit, more than 13,500 students were tested through the New Orleans Public Schools testing program in partnership with the Louisiana Department of Health. The COVID-19 positivity rate was 1%. For parents who learn their child has been exposed to COVID-19 in a school district like Union County Public Schools that has no testing protocols, the fear of what might happen next is all-consuming. Kenan Medlins son is immunocompromised and she was worried for days when she learned he was exposed to another student with COVID-19. Her sons recovery from respiratory illnesses typically takes longer than for other children. Medlin decided to pull her son out of class and homeschool him until the school district requires masks and offers testing. \"You should be able to go to public school and know that your child is going to be safe, cared for, and that the school will do everything they can to protect your children, but theyre just not doing that,\" she said. \"This is backing parents into a lot of corners and putting them in impossible situations.\"\\n\\nDespite the persistent pleas by public health officials to get vaccinated as coronavirus infections continue to surge, a staggeringly low number of pregnant people have been vaccinated against the virus nationwide. Just 25% of pregnant people in the United States between the ages of 18 and 49 are currently vaccinated with at least one dose, according to data through Sept. 11 compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The decision to not get vaccinated has resulted in a growing number of pregnant people ending up in intensive care wards, many severely ill with COVID-19. This worrisome uptick has been particularly evident in Mississippi, where state health officials have been sounding the alarm not only about the influx of fetal and maternal deaths, but also about several reports of pregnant women being turned away from getting the shot. \"Some of the patients had reported to us that they had gone to be vaccinated, and were turned away because they were pregnant. Those were people who were just sharing their experiences at pharmacies and other areas around the state,\" Dr. Michelle Owens, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at University of Mississippi Medical Center, told ABC News. Owens, alongside other state health officials, reported this week that not all of their patients had been vaccine-hesitant, but instead were turned down after disclosing that they were expecting. \"People are kind of adverse to pregnant patients when they come in. They\\'re hesitant to give pregnant patients medications, and certainly, vaccinations kind of fall into that,\" said Dr. Marty Tucker, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at UMMC, during a press conference on Thursday. In light of the concerning reports, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs issued a standing order last week for women to receive COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy, \"to give the pharmacy some reassurance for the places that it\\'s OK and recommended for pregnant women to get immunized at any stage in pregnancy.\" Owens added that health officials and physicians were all working together \"to help reduce barriers to vaccination for pregnant women, and we just really tried to amplify this information so that wherever a pregnant person goes in order to receive care or to receive a vaccine that they are welcomed with open arms and that they receive that vaccine.\" In Mississippi, 72 patients have experienced late pregnancy loss and 15 pregnant women have succumbed to the virus, more than half of whom have died since the end of July. None of the pregnant women who died was fully vaccinated, and the majority were overweight, according to Dobbs. \"There are NICUs all over this country that are filling up with babies who will not get to know their moms, and that\\'s devastating. There are families who are losing their matriarchs, and then, there are women who have been infected by this virus who won\\'t ever be the same,\" Owens said. Since the onset of the pandemic, more than 21,000 pregnant people have been hospitalized nationwide, and at least 155 have died as result of COVID-19, according to federal data. Additionally, there have been at least 266 pregnancy losses nationwide, and approximately 10.3% of patients have had to deliver prematurely. \"When we lose a mom, especially something that could be prevented, it is a tragedy. It does not discriminate, we see it in people with and without co-morbidities. We see it in people as young as 23 years old, so it is a bad actor across the board,\" Tucker said. Earlier in the pandemic, pregnant women at UMMC were not becoming as severely ill with COVID-19, but following the spread of the delta variant, Owens said, it became evident patients were becoming severely ill and deteriorating more quickly. \"We are seeing women, who may not have other co-morbid conditions, being affected at an earlier gestational age. Most of the people who we\\'re seeing now, are affected in the middle of their pregnancy, and they have a much more aggressive form of the disease,\" Owens said. \"The next thing you know, they end up progressing very quickly to need intubation.\" Pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 when compared to non-pregnant people, according to the CDC. In addition, they are also at increased risk for preterm birth and other poor pregnancy outcomes. The CDC and other leading health organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, have issued guidelines calling on all pregnant people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. \"CDC encourages all pregnant people or people who are thinking about becoming pregnant and those breastfeeding to get vaccinated to protect themselves from COVID-19,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement about the updated guidance last month. \"The vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible Delta variant and see severe outcomes from COVID-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people.\" The updated guidance from the CDC was based on further research that found pregnant people can receive an mRNA vaccine with no increased risk to themselves or their babies. \"[It] is really the most important thing to give pregnant women an opportunity to still be able to live to fight another day,\" Owens said. \"It\\'s really imperative that women get the good information to know that the COVID vaccine is safe, approved and recommended, and that it makes a big difference in whether or not a patient has severe disease, or potentially, could die.\"\\n\\nFor girls and young women accustomed to mountain climbing and physical fitness training six times a week, being confined in a crowded wedding hall near an airport in northern Afghanistan is a different kind of challenge -- one with their very fates at stake. It\\'s the new reality for dozens of them affiliated with Ascend, an organization that teaches Afghan women and girls athletic-based leadership skills. They came to the airport in Mazar-e-Sharif 10 days ago for evacuation flights the Taliban have blocked, heightening their fears they\\'ll be left behind. \"We\\'re trying to remind them we haven\\'t forgotten you. The world hasn\\'t forgotten you,\" Marina LeGree, founder and executive director of Ascend told ABC News. \"But some of them are losing hope.\" While the first passenger flight out of Kabul since the Taliban seized power took off on Thursday, carrying some U.S. citizens and other Westerners on board, life-and-death concerns loom for at-risk Afghans still in the country, especially for women like those of Ascend who have exercised independence in the last 20 years, free from Taliban rule. Founded in 2014, Ascend is a U.S.-based nonprofit operating in Afghanistan that recruits a new group of Afghan girls and young women aged 15-24 each year to embark on a two-year mountaineering program. The recruits -- who have trained in Ghaza Stadium, used by the last Taliban government for public punishment -- have a mission of fostering leadership, volunteerism, and physical and mental well-being for the next generation. But if the group in Mazar-e-Sharif is left behind, LeGree fears they\\'ll be married off to Taliban fighters -- or worse. Standoff at Mazar-e-Sharif For over a week now, the Taliban have not permitted at least six chartered flights to leave from Mazar-e-Sharif International Airport in northern Afghanistan, saying some evacuees do not have the proper documents to depart. The standoff is turning dire for some passengers, including the women of Ascend. LeGree, speaking to ABC News from Naples where she\\'s trying to get the State Department and others to help, said her group traveled from Kabul without their families with the understanding they\\'d be evacuated days ago. They\\'ve recounted to her since how the bathrooms are getting \"disgusting\" and it\\'s difficult to sleep. \"I\\'ve got teenage girls separated from their families in this kind of environment with the Taliban and men all over the place. It\\'s uncontrolled, and it\\'s not comfortable at all,\" she said. Many women affiliated with Ascend were born before or were too young to remember the last time the Taliban ruled in Afghanistan -- when women were barred from attending school, forced to wear all-encompassing burqas and be accompanied by a male relative whenever they went outside. Accustomed to their independence, with 80% of Ascend graduates going on to higher education, they fear for their future under the Taliban\\'s new \"caretaker government -- which, so far, includes no women in power. LeGree blamed the U.S. for promising to evacuate at-risk Afghans but missing out on \"precious time\" as the Taliban has gotten more organized. \"This is a whole bunch of women at risk about to be left to the slaughter if we can\\'t do something -- I\\'m horrified that my government had such a weak response,\" LeGree said. \"We\\'ve given you all the details of these people and you cleared them and call them to come, and now you\\'re saying, \\'You have to have travel documents and don\\'t worry if you do, you get to go\\'? That\\'s a complete abdication of responsibility, and it\\'s just -- it\\'s morally repugnant,\" she added. There are at least 1,000 people trying to fly out of Mazar-e-Sherif on these chartered flights, she said, including at least 19 U.S. citizens and two green card holders. She\\'s been told the Taliban have come inside the holding facility several times and taken people out, but those she\\'s in contact with aren\\'t sure why. So for now, they wait. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday the Biden administration was doing all it can to get the planes off the ground, including engaging in private talks with the Taliban through special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the new U.S. mission in Doha. \"The United States has pulled every lever available to us to facilitate the departure of these chartered flights from Mazar. The chartered flights, of course, have not taken off from Mazar -- I can tell you that has nothing to do with any inaction or action by the part of the United States government, and we were clear that we want to see the Taliban permit those who have expressed a desire to leave in this way to do so,\" he said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said Wednesday the charter flights in Mazar-e-Sharif \"need to move\" but that there are \"limits\" to what the U.S. can accomplish without personnel on the ground and without an airport under their control. He said it was his understanding the Taliban have objected to flights that combine passengers who have valid travel documents and those who do not. LeGree said that\\'s not sufficient. \"It was really hard day for me watching what Blinken said, because my hopes were high, because he was in Doha, that it would be easy for him to press upon the Qatari is to press upon the Taliban to just let us go -- and it didn\\'t happen,\" she said. While Ascend has successfully seen the evacuations of 56 staffers and Afghans, LeGree said it will be hard to sleep until all 88 who asked to be evacuated are out. Despite the hardship, Ascend plans to continue operating in some capacity when the situation in Afghanistan calms down. There are still some 150 women and alumni affiliated with the program who are staying behind and have expressed hope in continuing their mission. Ascend moved into a new facility this year, and LeGree paid the landlord rent on Wednesday as he holds the building for them, though she isn\\'t sure if she, herself, will be able to return to the country she also loves. \"Don\\'t assume that we\\'re closing up the shop. It\\'s quite the opposite,\" LeGree said. \"We need to keep the light shining on Afghan girls and women. Taliban have bullied their way into power now, but they have to govern. Let\\'s be in there with them.\" US women hike in support When Jahna Cook and Danielle Jefko of Madison, Wisconsin, learned that Ascend had women still stuck in Afghanistan hoping to evacuate, they felt a calling to get involved from the U.S. \"Their stories pulled on our hearts and hit home for us because we\\'re women, we\\'re moms and we climb together,\" Cook said. \"The freedom and accomplishment and leadership these girls so clearly have on the mountain was so relatable, and to see them facing the crisis at hand, we knew we had to do something.\" Inspired by an annual 50K race Ascend puts on in the U.K., Cook and Jefko made plans for a sister 50K, before moving the race up by two weeks as the chartered planes carrying Ascend members remained grounded. The women taped up photos of the girls along their route, she said, to keep their intent at top of mind. The two are continuing to encourage others to donate to Ascend\\'s resettlement fund or call their elected representatives. \"We want to make sure people know this is not a closed issue,\" Cook said. \"There are still people there that desperately need our help.\" ABC News\\' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.\\n\\nFour firefighters were injured while responding to the scene. A Dallas apartment building has partially collapsed after firefighters were called to investigate a carbon monoxide leak, according to officials. When firefighters arrived at the South Dallas apartment building around 10:30 a.m. local time, they noticed an odor of gas around the building, according to Dallas Fire-Rescue. An explosion occurred while fire crews were investigating the scene, causing the two-story building to partially collapse, officials said. The fire was producing flames and heavy smoke by 11 a.m., Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans told reporters in a news conference Wednesday afternoon. At least half of the building appeared to be badly damaged and piles of debris from the building could be seen strewn around the structure. \"The damage is extensive,\" Evans said. \"The collapse itself is extensive.\" Seven people, including four firefighters, were injured in the explosion and taken to local hospitals. Three firefighters are in critical condition; and the remaining victims are expected to be released from the hospital, according to Dallas Fire-Rescue.

The newborns were mixed up in 2002 after being born five hours apart at a hospital in La Rioja. They were both in incubators because they were born underweight. The woman, now 19, who first discovered she had been given to the wrong parents is demanding compensation of 3 million euros ($3.5 million) from local health authorities. Alba, the health chief, spoke after the local newspaper La Rioja published a report Tuesday about the switch. The other woman who was handed to the wrong parents has been informed of the mistake, the newspaper said. Neither woman was identified.\\n\\nIOWA CITY, Iowa -- They grow up in America as de facto Americans, then suddenly face the prospect of self-deportation and family separation. An estimated 200,000 young immigrants living legally in the U.S. for years as dependents of their parents on temporary work visas are aging out of the program into a precarious legal limbo, according to immigrant advocates. After turning 21, many of these children abruptly lose legal immigration status and are forced to choose between returning to their country of birth where theyve spent little time, or remaining in the US illegally to stay with their families. \"Everything I know is American. It just doesnt make sense for me to go back to a country that Ive lived in for 4 months,\" said Pareen Mhatre, 21, a University of Iowa senior and daughter of Indian immigrants who came to the US two decades ago and have built careers with long-term work visas. \"My family and I did everything by the book,\" Mhatre said. \"We have maintained documented status, and were still stuck in this decades long line [for a green card].\" Visa caps and lengthy backlogs for green card applications -- especially for foreign nationals from India and China, who can wait up to 89 years for permanent residency, according to the American Immigration Council -- have compounded the situation for children of long-term visa holders. Once they become adults, their dependent visas expire and they also get removed from pending green card applications filed together with their parents. \"There just hasn\\'t been enough attention to this particular flaw in the immigration system,\" said Dip Patel, founder of the advocacy group Improve the Dream. The government has granted protection and work visas to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants - known as \"Dreamers\" after the never-passed DREAM Act -- through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, but so-called \"documented Dreamers\" dont qualify. A precondition for DACA status is unlawful entry to the U.S. Children of parents on immigrant work visas like Pareen have been residing lawfully in the country. \"There are options for these young immigrants, but all of those options are backlogged for the most part,\" said immigration attorney Jessica Malott. \"So, its not something thats a sure thing, thats gonna happen immediately.\" In a statement to ABC News, the Department of Homeland Security cited several factors contributing to the backlogs, including the pandemic and a lack of adequate staffing, and pledged that officials are working to address the problem. \"DHS is aware of the predicament that these documented dreamers face and is working to find legal means to provide relief where possible,\" the agency said. The issue has also recently won attention from Congress, where members of the House and Senate from both parties have introduced legislation to lift the threat of deportation and the inability to work from this category of legal immigrants. \"Once you meet them, you realize what a contribution theyre already making to this country and what greater contributions they will make in the future,\" said Rep. Deborah Ross, D-N.C., who is co-sponsoring the Americas CHILDREN Act in the House. \"What it does is it sets a path for residency and then, ultimately, after residency, one of these dreamers could pursue citizenship so that a young person doesnt have to immediately self-deport,\" she said of the legislation. A similar measure has been introduced in the Senate by California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla and Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul. \"These children who have legally called the United States home for many years and even decades ... shouldnt be penalized by the governments failures in addressing green card backlogs,\" Paul said in a statement. After turning 21 in April, Mhatre was able to extend her legal status by obtaining a short-term student visa while she finishes her degree in biomedical engineering. After that shell have to either win an employment visa through the lottery, or self-deport to India. \"I knew that I wasnt an American citizen, but I thought I was a permanent resident because America was the only place I had known,\" Mhatre said of her upbringing in Iowa City, Iowa. \"Like \"Dreamers,\" we come to this country as young children. We grow up, and at a certain point - multiple points - in our lives we do face an aspect of self-deportation. But everything I know is American. It just doesnt make sense for me to go back to a country that Ive lived in for 4 months,\" she said. Some families have already experienced slow-rolling family separations under the policy. Byung Yoon, a small business owner and father of three in Portland, Oregon, says his oldest son aged out of a dependent visa and had to return to South Korea on his own. His 17-year-old daughter Hilary -- whos lived in the U.S. since she was an infant -- may be next. \"The only thing I know about Korea is what I see on the media or what my family says. I personally dont have any recollection of Korea,\" Hilary Yoon said. \"She does not speak Korean very well, and she does not understand Korean culture very well,\" added her father. \"We think that some kind of immigration law will pass through. America is an immigrant country.\" Patel, who is himself a documented dreamer from India, says hes optimistic Congress is finally comprehending the scope of the issue and taking steps toward addressing it. \"I think finally, we\\'re at a point where people are starting to recognize that this was an issue in the immigration system that really needs fixing,\" he said. \"We\\'re just going to keep pushing until we can obtain it. And I hope that we\\'re really close.\" Mhatre, who shared her story in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee earlier this year, said shes clear-eyed about the long odds any immigration reform faces but finds hope in her deep love for America. \"There were times when even I was like, why are we doing this, you know, because those times were incredibly tough for my family. But, she added, \"this country is my home.\" ABC News\\' Quinn Owen contributed to this report.\\n\\nSome of the nations most aggressive COVID-19 vaccine mandates are scheduled to take effect Monday in New York amid continued resistance from some to the shots NEW YORK -- Some of the nation\\'s most aggressive COVID-19 vaccine mandates are scheduled to take effect Monday in New York amid continued resistance from some to the shots, leaving hospitals and nursing homes across the state and schools in New York City bracing for possible staff shortages. Many health care workers, including support staff such as cleaners, have still not yet received a required first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine days before a Sept. 27 deadline. That\\'s the same deadline for teachers and school workers in New York City to prove they\\'ve received at least one shot. That left the prospect of potentially thousands of health care workers and teachers being forced off the job next week. Despite calls from unions and administrators to delay the mandates, Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio showed no signs of backing down. \"Every single person who is in your care has the right to know that there is no chance they will be infected by the person in charge of protecting them and their health,\" Hochul, a Democrat, said Thursday. Hospitals and nursing homes were preparing contingency plans that included cutting back on elective surgeries and, at one hospital, halting maternity services. Nursing homes were limiting admissions. The states largest health care provider, Northwell Health, was keeping thousands of volunteers on standby. \"We would like to see some more time to be able to comply and implement the vaccine mandate, because at the end of the day its a situation where were very concerned about our ability to care for the patients,\" said Tom Quatroche, CEO of the Erie County Medical Center Corporation, which operates a busy 573-bed hospital in Buffalo. It anticipates that about 10% of its workforce, or 400 staff members, might still be unvaccinated Monday. Under a contingency plan, the hospital said it would suspend elective inpatient surgeries, temporarily stop accepting ICU transfers from other institutions and reduce hours at clinics. New York is not the only state to require health care workers to get vaccinated. But it has been especially aggressive in pushing for wider vaccinations to help limit the spread of the virus. The mayor and governor said workers had plenty of time to get the shots. The mandate for state health care workers was announced this summer. New York City announced in July that its teachers would need to either get vaccinated or tested for COVID-19 weekly, but it then revoked the test-out option in August. While most school workers have been vaccinated, inducing nearly 90% of teachers as of Thursday, unions representing New York City principals and teachers warned that could still leave the 1 million student school system short of as many as 10,000 teachers, along with other staff such as cafeteria workers and school police officers. Those who dont provide proof of a shot by the end of Monday will not be allowed to return to classrooms Tuesday, which will leave principals scrambling overnight to make sure they have enough substitutes, educators warned. The unions said that while they\\'ve encouraged everyone to get vaccinated, some schools could be dangerously low on staff Tuesday. They pleaded for the mayor to delay the mandate after a judge refused to halt the rule. \"We are concerned. Very, very concerned,\" United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew said. Mark Cannizzaro, the president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, said some schools have as many as 100 staff members not in compliance. De Blasio insisted the city was ready. \"Weve been planning all along. We have a lot of substitutes ready,\" the Democrat said in a radio interview on Friday. \"A lot is going to happen between now and Monday but beyond that, we are ready, even to the tune of, if we need thousands, we have thousands.\" The mandate for health care workers comes as hospitals are already reeling from staff shortages due in part to rising demand, workers retiring and weary employees seeking other jobs after 18 months of the pandemic. There is one option for health care workers who don\\'t want to get the shot, which is to apply for a religious exemption. That would buy them until at least Oct. 12, while a federal judge considers a legal challenge arguing that such exemptions are constitutionally required. Meanwhile, a state judge in Albany agreed to set aside a Monday deadline for court employees to get a first vaccine shot and would hear arguments next week on whether to extend the stay. The CSEA, which represents 5,800 workers, argued that the mandate should have been negotiated and not imposed unilaterally by the court system. Earlier, another judge threw out a last-minute effort Friday by seven health care workers and Republican Niagara County legislator John Syracuse to delay the health care mandate. With time ticking down on the health care mandate, Northwell Health was trying to persuade thousands of holdouts to get vaccinated, including individual meetings with staffers. The systems personnel chief, Maxine Carrington, said they\\'re seeing a lot more appointments being scheduled. \"Ive had personal conversations with team members, and I was asked by one: \\'Are you really going to fire us on the 27th? And I said, lets put that aside for a minute and lets talk about saving your life. Why dont you want to get vaccinated?\" Carrington said. She said staff that refuse the inoculations will \"no longer be qualified for employment.\" As of Thursday, about 90% of Northwell\\'s 74,000 active personnel had been vaccinated. Still, the hospital system acknowledged that it did not expect full compliance and had more than 3,000 retirees, volunteers and health care students on standby, should they be needed. The University of Rochester Medical Center, in the states fourth largest city, announced a two-week pause in scheduling new elective procedures at its Strong Memorial Hospital beginning Monday. It also is temporarily closing two urgent care centers. One wild card is no one knows if a burst of health care workers will simply wait until the last minute to get a jab. One hopeful sign: New York-Presbyterian, one of the state\\'s largest hospital systems, had imposed an earlier vaccination deadline on its workers -- midnight Wednesday -- and reported fewer than 250 of its 48,000 staffers had failed to comply. Spokesperson Alexandra Langan said in an email: \"For those who chose not to comply, they will not continue to work at NYP.\" New York state has been averaging just under 5,000 new COVID-19 cases per day with around 2,300 people hospitalized. Thats far worse than in late June, when around 300 people were testing positive each day statewide. ------ Hill reported from Albany.

Yes, but studies indicate they\\'re less likely than adults to be affected by symptoms that persist, recur or begin a month or more after infection. Estimates vary on how often the symptoms known as long COVID-19 occur in kids. A recently published U.K. study found about 4% of young children and teens had symptoms more than a month after getting infected. Fatigue, headaches and loss of smell were among the most common complaints and most were gone by two months. Coughing, chest pain and brain fog are among other long-term symptoms sometimes found in kids, and can occur even after mild infections or no initial symptoms. Some studies have found higher rates of persisting symptoms than in the U.K. study, but kids are thought to be less commonly affected than adults. About 30% of adult COVID-19 patients develop long-term symptoms, according to some estimates. Experts arent sure what causes the long-term symptoms. In some cases, it could reflect organ damage caused by the initial infection. Or it could be a result of the virus and inflammation lingering in the body. Kids can develop other rare problems after an initial coronavirus infection, including heart inflammation or a condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome. That involves fever and inflammation affecting different body parts, among other possible symptoms. Affected kids generally need to be hospitalized but most recover. A similar condition can occur in adults. The rapid spread of the highly contagious delta variant has some doctors worrying about the potential for higher numbers of children being at risk for long COVID-19 and these other conditions. Because of the potential for long-term consequences, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends follow-up doctor visits after children recover from an initial coronavirus infection. ------ The AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in this series.

While hospitalization rates in states like Florida and Mississippi, hit hard early in the delta surge, are beginning to decline, other southern states, including Kentucky, are showing no signs of infection and hospitalization rates slowing down. \"We walk into the hospital and it feels like the world is on fire,\" Dr. Karan Singh, a pulmonologist at Med Center Health in Bowling Green, Kentucky, told ABC News. Statewide, there are more than 2,600 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 -- the highest on record, and currently, just 7% of intensive care beds remain available. At the state\\'s previous peak last December, there were 1,000 fewer patients hospitalized. Last week, Kentucky reported more than 30,000 new cases, according to Gov. Andy Beshear, a weekly record since the onset of the pandemic. \"Our hospital situation has never been more dire in my lifetime than it is right now,\" Beshear said. \"We cannot handle more sick individuals.\" More than 400 members of the Kentucky National Guard, as well as strike teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency\\'s emergency medical services, have now been deployed to help struggling hospitals across the state. \"I would honestly say it\\'s at least three times worse than what it was the first time,\" nurse Kerri Eklund, from Baptist Health Hardin, in Elizabethtown, told ABC News. \"We\\'re seeing a lot of people getting really sick. There are patients that will come in and they\\'ll be doing okay for a few days and then, in the blink of an eye, they go downhill.\" The current wave of infections caught many health care workers by surprise, added Heather Brock, another nurse at Baptist Health Hardin. Earlier this year, with vaccinations available, there was a sense that things would return to normal. However, nearly nine months into the country\\'s vaccination rollout, and less than 50% of Kentucky\\'s total population has been fully vaccinated. \"I wasn\\'t expecting this much of a surge again. In my opinion, it\\'s worse than the previous ones,\" Brock said. Front-line health workers said that the situation escalated quickly, after a short period of relief earlier this summer, and nearly all patients have been unvaccinated. Across Kentucky, state data shows that 91.6% of COVID-19 related hospitalizations between March 1, and Aug. 31, have been among partially or unvaccinated residents. \"The patients who are vaccinated are doing a lot better,\" said Eklund. In fact, \"patients who are vaccinated, most of the time don\\'t even need oxygen, and they\\'re just here because they have a few of the other complications and they\\'re monitored. Most of the patients who end up going downhill, unfortunately, have not been vaccinated.\" Many patients the teams are treating remain in the intensive care unit for weeks at a time, said Baptist Health Hardin nurse Clara Robertson, while \"suffering and struggling for breath, that entire time. And then a lot of times, unfortunately, losing that battle, and dying.\" The states most recent wave has been a difficult reality to face, added Eklund, as well as emotionally crushing for the medical staff to watch so many patients suffer. The patients, \"have been doing all they can and trying their hardest, and then they just get to the point that their body can\\'t handle it anymore. And I think their minds start to break, because they\\'ve been giving it all and they\\'re still not getting any better.\" Medical professionals, whether doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants or respiratory therapists -- all are stretched so thin that many are experiencing exhaustion, compassion fatigue and burnout. \"We\\'re being tasked with daunting assignments, and everyone is emotionally, physically and mentally exhausted,\" noted Brian Deweese, a respiratory therapist at Med Center Health. The fatigue is such, he said, that \"we are seeing highly experienced and exceptional health care workers walk away from their profession altogether, because of the stress and anxiety they\\'re having to deal with.\" Outside the walls of the hospital, Singh said many community members do not fully realize the severity of the COVID-19 crisis across the state. \"When we leave, and we go to the grocery store, or we talk to people not in medicine, it\\'s like the world is just unaware of what is happening,\" Singh said. And front-line workers say they worry this surge will only further deteriorate, as they prepare for fall and winter. \"I\\'m really worried that it\\'s just going to keep getting worse, and I hope that we\\'re able to find a way to protect everyone, and have what we need, because we all know that winter is the worst time for health issues all together,\" said Eklund. \"I\\'m really hoping that we\\'re not going to have to see a lot of lives lost.\\n\\n'"
