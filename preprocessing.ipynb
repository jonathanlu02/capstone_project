       "'Muslim Americans who grew up under the shadow of 9/11 have faced hostility and surveillance, mistrust and suspicion NEW YORK -- A car passed, the drivers window rolled down and the man spat an epithet at two little girls wearing their hijabs: \"Terrorist!\" It was 2001, mere weeks after the World Trade Center fell, and 10-year-old Shahana Hanif and her younger sister were walking to the local mosque from their Brooklyn home. As the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks approaches, Hanif still recalls her confusion over how anyone could look at her, a child, and see a threat. \"Its not a nice, kind word. It means violence, it means dangerous. It is meant to shock whoever ... is on the receiving end of it,\" she says. But the incident also spurred a determination to speak out for herself and others. She\\'s become a community organizer and is strongly favored to win a seat on the New York City Council in an upcoming election. Like Hanif, other young American Muslims have grown up under the shadow of 9/11. Many have faced hostility, suspicion, questions about their faith, doubts over their Americanness. Theyve also found ways to fight back against bias, to organize, to craft nuanced personal narratives about their identities. In the process, theyve built bridges and challenged stereotypes. There is \"this sense of being Muslim as a kind of important identity marker, regardless of your relationship with Islam as a faith,\" says Eman Abdelhadi, a University of Chicago sociologist. Mistrust of Muslims didnt start on 9/11, but it dramatically intensified with the attacks. Americas diverse Muslim communities were foisted into the spotlight, says Youssef Chouhoud, a political scientist at Virginias Christopher Newport University. \"Your sense of who you were was becoming more formed, not just Muslim but American Muslim,\" he says. \"What distinguished you as an American Muslim? Could you be fully both, or did you have to choose? There was a lot of grappling with what that meant.\" In Hanifs case, there was no blueprint. \"Fifth-grader me wasnt naive or too young to know Muslims are in danger,\" she wrote in an essay about 9/11\\'s aftermath. \"...Flashing an American flag from our first-floor windows didnt make me more American.\" A young Hanif gathered neighborhood friends to write a letter to then-President George W. Bush asking for protection. \"We knew,\" she says, \"that we would become like warriors of this community.\" ------ But being warriors often carries a price. Ishaq Pathan, 26, recalls when a boy told him he seemed angry and wondered if Pathan was going to blow up their Connecticut school. He remembers feeling helpless when taken aside at an airport for additional questioning upon returning to the United States after a college semester in Morocco. The agent looked through his belongings, including the laptop where he kept a private journal, and started reading it. \"I remember having tears in my eyes. I was completely and utterly powerless,\" says Pathan. \"You go to school with other people of different backgrounds and you realize ... what the promise of the United States is,\" he adds. \"And when you see it not living up to that promise, then I think it instills in us a sense of wanting to help and fix that.\" He now works as the San Francisco Bay Area director for the nonprofit Islamic Networks Group, trying to help younger generations grow confident in their Muslim identity. ------ Born in Somalia, Shukri Olow fled civil war with her family and lived in Kenyan refugee camps before eventually finding home in a public housing complex in Kent, south of Seattle. After 9/11, she recalls feeling confused when a teacher in America asked, \"What are your people doing?\" Today, shes seeking a seat on the King County Council. \"There are many young people who have multiple identities who have felt that they dont belong here, that they are not welcomed here,\" she says. \"I was one of those young people. And so I try to do what I can to make sure that more of us know that this is our nation, too.\" ------ After 9/11, some American Muslims chose to dispel misconceptions about their faith through personal connections. Mansoor Shams has traveled across the U.S. with a sign reading: \"Im Muslim and a U.S. Marine, ask anything.\" Its part of the 39-year-old veterans efforts to counter hate through dialogue. In 2019, he spoke to students at Liberty University in Virginia; some still call him with questions about Islam. \"Theres this mutual love and respect,\" he says. Shams wishes his current work wasnt needed but feels a responsibility to share a counternarrative he says many Americans dont know. Ahmed Ali Akbar, 33, came to a different conclusion. Shortly after 9/11, some adults in his community arranged for an assembly at his school in Saginaw, Michigan, where he and other students talked about Islam and Muslims. But he recalls his confusion at some of the questions: Where is Osama bin Laden? Whats the reason behind the attacks? That period left him feeling like trying to change peoples minds wasnt always effective. Akbar eventually turned his focus toward telling stories about Muslim Americans on his podcast \"See Something Say Something.\" \"Theres a lot of humor in the Muslim American experience as well,\" he says. \"Its not all just sadness and reaction to the violence and...racism and Islamophobia.\" ------ Amirah Ahmed, 17, was born after the attacks and feels she was thrust into a struggle not of her making. A few years ago at her Virginia schools 9/11 commemoration, she felt students stares at her and her hijab. For the next anniversary, she wore her Americanness as a shield, donning an American flag headscarf to address her classmates from a podium. Ahmed spoke about honoring both the lives of those who died in America on 9/11 and of Iraqis who died in the war launched in 2003. She says it was a \"really powerful moment.\" But she hopes her future children dont feel the need to prove they belong. \"Our kids are going to be (here) well after the 9/11 era,\" she says. \"They should not have to continue fighting for their identity.\" ------ Fam, who reported from Cairo, Egypt, covers Islam for the APs global religion team.

Not everyone around the NFL may be as healthy to kick off this season with COVID-19 proving to be an issue hovering over another season. \"Everybody, whether its the league, whether its your family, my family, we all have to just understand that were going to deal with some things,\" Titans coach Mike Vrabel said Monday. \"Were going to deal with positive test results from vaccinated people. Well follow the protocols how we have to and try to be as safe as we possibly can.\" Vrabel, who said last spring he was vaccinated, was the first to test positive Aug. 22 in an outbreak that reached at least 14, including 10 players. Vrabel is optimistic that both center Ben Jones and right guard Nate Davis will be back soon enough to practice before the Titans host Arizona in the season opener Sunday. Other NFL teams may be without starters for their openers. Miami put its presumed starting left tackle Austin Jackson and backup tight end Adam Shaheen on the COVID-19 reserve list Monday ahead of Sunday\\'s opener at New England. Carolina starting right guard John Miller also went on the reserve list Monday and will miss the Panthers\\' home opener against the Jets. Miller will be out 10 days, which indicates under league rules he was unvaccinated and tested positive. Carolina coach Matt Rhule said last week only two Panthers\\' players had not been vaccinated. The Jets are waiting to see if wide receiver Jamison Crowder will be available after going on the reserve list last Friday after testing positive. Vaccinated, Crowder needs to test negative 24 hours apart twice under NFL protocols. Dallas likely will be without four-time Pro Bowl right guard Zack Martin for its opener Thursday night at Tampa Bay. All-Pro safety Tyrann Mathieu, who is vaccinated, remained out Monday after his positive test for COVID-19 as the two-time defending AFC champions began preparing Monday for their season opener against Cleveland. Ryan Tannehill was just starting to practice with AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year Derrick Henry, seven-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Julio Jones and Pro Bowl receiver A.J. Brown when the Titans quarterback was put on the reserve list Aug. 26. He was activated Saturday and was on the field Monday. Vrabel said Tannehill will have to build a relationship with Jones, acquired by trade in June, on the field. Both have met extensively, the Titans have talked about it and now must finetune in practice for the opener. Asked if he talked to his players about staying safe before having a three-day weekend off, Vrabel said the Titans always try to be smart about what they do. \"Judging from the games that I watched, I didnt see that COVID was much of a concern for anybody, but we have to be smart in the decisions that we make,\" Vrabel said. \"Whether it is who we hang out with, what we do, and I think that they are very conscious of that.\" ------ Follow Teresa M.

Now, with 174 million people already fully vaccinated, a small portion are experiencing a so-called \"breakthrough\" infection, meaning they test positive for COVID-19 after being vaccinated. But doctors say this virus -- which can be deadly for an unvaccinated person -- most often leads to much milder symptoms in those who already got their shots, with a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analysis finding vaccinated people are 29 times less likely to require hospitalization and four times less likely to be infected with COVID-19, even when the delta variant is predominant. \"We know vaccination is not 100%,\" said Dr. Jay Bhatt, an internist and adjunct faculty at the UIC School of Public Health and an ABC News contributor. \"That being said, we know that most people in the ICU are unvaccinated individuals.\" Still, breakthrough infections do happen. The CDC has very specific guidance about what vaccinated people should do if they are exposed to someone with COVID-19, or if they test positive themselves. If a vaccinated person is exposed to the virus -- meaning a close contact has tested positive -- they don\\'t need to quarantine, but they should get a COVID test three to five days after that exposure. And they should wear a mask in public indoor spaces, like the grocery store, while awaiting test results. But if a vaccinated person receives a positive test result or has symptoms after exposure, they should isolate for 10 days. A repeat test is not needed at the end of the 10-day isolation period, though the person should be fever-free for at least 24 hours before ending quarantine. Vaccination status does not change isolation recommendations for those who test positive because they can still be contagious, though the CDC reports that the contagious period may be shorter than in those who are unvaccinated and viral load lessens after five days. Since those who are vaccinated and infected with COVID-19 are still able to transmit the virus, their close contacts should also be contacted and tested. A close contact is a person who has spent more than 15 minutes with a COVID-19 positive person while unmasked and less than 6 feet apart. Fully vaccinated people who test positive may also be eligible for authorized COVID-19 treatments, if their doctor says it\\'s necessary. Therapies such as monoclonal antibodies can still be given to COVID-positive patients in a high-risk category, even if they are vaccinated. \"Monoclonal antibodies are intended for those with COVID-19 who are high risk, which includes those over 65, and those who have chronic disease, cancer or are immunocompromised,\" Bhatt said. \"The chances of allergic reactions or adverse events are relatively low.\" Monoclonal antibodies, laboratory-made proteins which mimic the immune systems antibodies, work best when given in the first few days after a positive test result or symptom onset. After receiving monoclonal antibodies, further COVID-19 vaccination, such as a booster, should be delayed by 90 days to optimize response to the vaccine. Other treatments, such as steroids or antivirals like Remdesivir, are more commonly given for hospitalized and severe cases, which are less likely to occur in vaccinated individuals. While breakthrough infections are likely to be mild, its important to follow recommended guidelines to reduce the spread of infection. Wearing masks in large crowds and staying home when not feeling well will help protect both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

In its final form, Senate Bill 1 revises the states election laws to tighten ballot access and administration. Some of the provisions outlined in the legislation also appear to be responses to efforts taken by Houston-area officials in Harris County to broaden ballot access during the 2020 general election amid the coronavirus pandemic. Although there was no evidence of widespread fraud across Texas following the 2020 election, Republican proponents of the legislation claim it seeks to restore voter confidence in the states election parameters. \"One thing that all Texans can agree [on], and that is that we must have trust and confidence in our elections. The bill that I\\'m about to sign, helps to achieve that goal,\" Gov. Greg Abbott said at Tuesdays bill signing ceremony in Tyler, Texas. Republican supporters of the legislation -- including the states Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick -- also praised the bill as a tool for deterring \"cheaters\" from casting fraudulent ballots. \"Texas turns out voters because they have confidence that our elections are always going to be fair and Senate Bill 1 will give them even more confidence. We want to see more people vote, we want to see them vote fairly and we don\\'t want the cheaters to undermine our elections,\" Patrick said during the bill signing ceremony. The bills transcendence into law signals a political win for Abbott, who made \"election integrity\" a priority over the course of two special legislative sessions. The move also echoes Abbotts political alignment with former President Donald Trump, who baselessly attacked the nations election processes after his presidential loss in November. Meanwhile, Texas Democrats insist they will continue to push back politically. \"The signing of this harmful bill will only make us more determined,\" Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement Tuesday. Democrats in the state legislature had been battling the legislation for months. After breaking quorum in May to prevent the first iteration of the bill from passing by not providing enough members to pass legislation, House Democrats fled to Washington, D.C. ahead of a subsequent July special session in hopes of working with federal lawmakers to push for national voting rights legislation. Their exit brought the legislature to a halt until Abbott called for a second special session in August. Faced with a reemerging COVID-19 crisis at home, enough Democrat lawmakers returned to Austin to clear a quorum and watch the Republican majority put the bill over the finish line. The legislation goes into effect in December, three months following the end of the latest special session, at which point it will officially ban drive-through and 24-hour voting sites, both of which were widely utilized in the populous and diverse Harris County -- one of the states few deeply blue political areas. The new law will also make it a state jail felony for election officials to proactively send applications for mail ballot requests to voters if the voters themselves did not request the documents. During the 2020 campaign season, Harris County election officials attempted to send mail ballot applications to millions of the countys registered voters, but the effort was halted by the Texas Supreme Court. Under the new law, poll watchers will have \"free movement\" within polling places. They will also have the ability to \"observe all election activities\" including the closing of polling places and the transfer of election materials. Although the provision prohibits poll watchers from observing voters as they fill out ballots, the legislation makes it a criminal offense if an election official \"knowingly prevents a watcher from observing an activity,\" while also prohibiting officials from refusing to accept watchers into a polling place. Voting rights advocates consistently criticized these provisions as creating ballot access hurdles for people of color. In response, Republicans frequently touted the new laws expansion of early voting hours, which will mandate that counties with populations of 55,000 people or more provide at least 12 hours of early voting during the second week of the early voting period. Upon signing the bill into law, Abbott praised the new law\\'s expansion of in-person early voting while drawing an inaccurate comparison to the voting parameters in President Joe Bidens home state of Delaware, which Abbott said does not have an early voting period. Although Delaware did not have early voting in the 2020 campaign cycle, it will have an early voting period implemented in 2022, which would coincide with when S.B. 1 going into effect. Republicans also removed a highly controversial provision that was outlined in a failed version of a \"voter integrity\" bill and limited the start of Sunday early voting hours. That measure was seen as a direct response to \"souls to the polls\" voting mobilization traditions in Black churchgoing communities and was often cited in criticisms from Democrats throughout their second quorum break. The ensuing fallout of the now-defunct provision spurred lawmakers to add an hour to the early voting time frame on Sundays to the bill signed by Abbott. The effects of S.B 1 would play out just as the 2022 midterm election cycle gears up across one of the nations emerging political battlegrounds, but at least two federal lawsuits filed in Austin and San Antonio were already contesting the laws legitimacy before Abbott signed the bill into law. Meanwhile Texas Democrats -- many of whom hoped to stall the legislation in July by breaking quorum and camping out in Washington, D.C. -- continue to put pressure on federal lawmakers to act. \"Senate Bill 1 will go into effect on December 3rd. With the deliberate barriers to voting created by this legislation and redistricting just around the corner, we need the U.S. Senate to act immediately on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Our democracy depends on it,\" Texas House Democratic Chair Chris Turner said in a statement.\\nHealth authorities in Spain are blaming human error for the switching of two baby girls in a maternity ward almost 20 years ago MADRID -- Health authorities in Spain are blaming human error for the switching of two baby girls in a maternity ward almost 20 years ago, after one of them discovered by chance through a DNA test as a teenager that she wasnt the daughter of her presumed parents. \"It was a human error and we havent been able to find out who was to blame,\" Sara Alba, health chief of Spains northern La Rioja region, told a news conference Tuesday. \"The systems back then were different and werent as computerized as they are now,\" Alba said, offering assurances it couldnt happen again. The newborns were mixed up in 2002 after being born five hours apart at a hospital in La Rioja. They were both in incubators because they were born underweight. The woman, now 19, who first discovered she had been given to the wrong parents is demanding compensation of 3 million euros ($3.5 million) from local health authorities. Alba, the health chief, spoke after the local newspaper La Rioja published a report Tuesday about the switch. The other woman who was handed to the wrong parents has been informed of the mistake, the newspaper said. Neither woman was identified.\\nAreas are still grappling with no power and boil water advisories. The nation is still grappling with the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, which made landfall Aug. 29 and knocked out power to more than 1 million customers in Louisiana. At least 82 people have died due to the storm -- which hit Louisiana as a Category 4 hurricane -- as well as the devastation it left across eight states. In Louisiana, 26 have died due to the storm\\'s wrath. The Louisiana Health Department confirmed two more storm-related deaths Tuesday in St. Tammany Parish: a 68-year-old man who fell off a roof while making repairs to damage caused by Ida and a 71-year-old man who died due to a lack of oxygen during an extended power outage. On Wednesday, they announced an additional 11 deaths, all in Orleans Parish and nine from heat-related illness due to power outages. The two others died of carbon monoxide poisoning. In the Northeast, at least 52 have died. The Harrison Police Department in Westchester County, New York, confirmed on Monday the recovery of a woman\\'s body who went missing during last week\\'s flooding. President Joe Biden surveyed the damage of Ida\\'s remnants in New York and New Jersey on Tuesday. Biden said that amid the storm\\'s destruction, there was also an \"opportunity\" to open the country\\'s eyes and get people to heed the urgent warnings from scientists, adding, \"I think we\\'ve all seen --even the climate skeptics are seeing -- that this really does matter.\" Biden has touted the extreme weather as a critical reason why Congress should pass his infrastructure package. Recovery efforts continue in the South, where 70% of the 948,000 Entergy utility customers who lost power finally had it restored, the company said Wednesday. In Louisiana, 301,000 customers remained with outages Wednesday evening, and in New Orleans, 83% of customers who lost power had it restored and 35,000 customers remain in the dark, Entergy said. On Wednesday evening, Entergy said it hoped to have 90% of customers in New Orleans back on line that night. A team of 26,000 workers is restoring downed and damaged power lines. However, some hard-hit areas, including Lafourche Parish and Plaquemines Parish aren\\'t forecast to have power restored until Sept. 29, according to the company\\'s estimation. In Louisiana and Mississippi, 30,679 poles, 36,469 spans of wire and 5,959 transformers were damaged or destroyed -- that\\'s more than Katrina, Ike, Delta and Zeta combined. Access to water remains a major problem in the state, with boil water advisories still in place in the parishes of Jefferson, Lafourche, St. Charles, St. Tammany, St. John the Baptist, Plaquemines and Tangipahoa. Tuesday marked the last day for locals to evacuate to Ida shelters in northern Louisiana. About 14,000 people in Lafourche Parish were left homeless after Ida razed through and destroyed 75% of the structures there. \"We are working feverishly, as hard as we can to get all people what they need to keep their lives going and to rebuild our community,\" Lafourche Parish President Archie Chaisson said to CNN on Monday. Nursing home deaths are also a mounting concern in the state. Among those who died in Louisiana, seven were nursing home residents who were transferred to a warehouse in Independence in Tangipahoa Parish and later died. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry has opened an investigation into the deaths. Only five of the seven deaths were confirmed by the state to be storm-related. The Louisiana Health Department is investigating nursing homes that transferred patients there and ordered all of them to shut down Saturday. On Tuesday, officials announced they revoked the licenses for seven nursing homes that evacuated to the facility ahead of Ida. Those nursing homes were: River Palms Nursing and Rehab in Orleans Parish, South Lafourche Nursing and Rehab in Lafourche Parish, Maison Orleans Healthcare Center in Orleans Parish, Park Place Healthcare Nursing Home in Jefferson Parish, West Jefferson Health Care Center in Jefferson Parish, Maison De Ville Nursing Home in Terrebonne Parish, Maison Deville Nursing Home of Harvey in Jefferson Parish. \"Ultimately, lives were lost -- these were grandparents, neighbors and friends, and we know families are hurting. We as a Department are taking formal regulatory action,\" the LDH said in a statement. On Saturday, during wellness checks at eight New Orleans facilities, five nursing home residents were found dead, the city said in a news release. None of those have been confirmed to be storm-related. In response, the city determined all eight facilities were \"unfit\" and evacuated nearly 600 residents to hospitals and shelters. Also in Louisiana, at least four people have died and 141 were treated in hospitals for carbon monoxide poisoning in the wake of Ida, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, prompting officials to urge the public for safe generator use. Officials advise placing generators at least 20 feet away from a home and assure all air entry points near the unit and home are properly sealed. ABC News\\' Sarah Kolinovsky and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.\\nAs COVID-19 case rates remain at a level not seen since before vaccines were widely available in the United States, President Joe Biden is set to deliver remarks Thursday on a new strategy to stop the spread of the contagious delta variant, White House officials confirmed Tuesday. \"On Thursday the president will speak to the American people about his robust plan to stop the spread of the delta variant and boost vaccinations,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. In the remarks, \"the president will lay out a six-pronged strategy,\" involving both the public and private sectors, she added. Biden has already made significant moves in requiring vaccines among public sector workers. He instituted a vaccine requirement for the nation\\'s 2.1 million federal employees, and the Department of Defense will require vaccination for 1.3 million active duty service members. But realistically, Biden has limited legal authority to institute a broad vaccine mandate for most Americans. \"Yes, that\\'s -- that\\'s true,\" Psaki said Tuesday, confirming Biden\\'s hands are tied when it comes to a widespread mandate. Psaki did seem to suggest that Biden will call on the private sector to institute more mandates. Major corporations such as Facebook, Google and Citigroup have already announced vaccination requirements. \"We dont have any preview quite yet. I will note that we\\'ve seen that there are a range of ways that we have increased vaccinations across the country, or vaccinations have increased, I should say. One of them is private sector companies mandating in different capacities that their employees get vaccinated. Or certain school districts mandate,\" Psaki said Tuesday. Biden alluded to his plan to lay out his COVID-19 strategy in economic remarks Friday, focused on the disappointing August jobs report. \"Theres no question the delta variant is why todays jobs report isnt stronger. I know people were looking, and I was hoping, for a higher number. But next week, Ill lay out the next steps that are going to -- were going to need to combat the delta variant, to address some of those fears and concerns,\" Biden said Friday. Part of the strategy Biden referenced Friday is to ask states and local governments to consider using federal funding to extend unemployment benefits in hard-hit areas. \"I want to talk about how well further protect our schools, our businesses, our economy, and our families from the threat of delta. As we continue to fight the delta variant, the American Rescue Plan we passed continues to support families, businesses, and communities. Even as some of the benefits that were provided are set to expire next week, states have the option to extend those benefits and the federal resources from the Rescue Plan to do so. Not more federal taxes, state taxes, but they have the federal money to be able to do that. States continue to have access to a wide array of support, like help for schools that are reopening, help for childcare centers to make them available and affordable, and other resources to help our economy get back to normal,\" Biden said Friday. But no states have indicated a plan a to take Biden up on his proposal. The remarks are scheduled for just 11 days before the administration is set to begin widely rolling out booster shots of Pfizer, a process that has been mired by confusion as some public health experts say the data doesn\\'t yet support the need for boosters, and as Moderna failed to meet the data reporting deadline to begin offering boosters the same day as Pfizer. As as children return to school for the fall semester, many in-person for the first time since the start of the pandemic, fears are rising that classrooms could host even more virus spread. \"We need to continue to take more steps to make sure school districts are prepared and make sure communities across the country are prepared,\" Psaki said Tuesday. The administration did announce one positive milestone Tuesday: at least 75% of adults in the U.S. have at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the White House COVID-19 data director.\\nCourt was dismissed early to allow both sides to regroup and strategize. After over 560 days of delay, the drawn-out pretrial proceedings of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other detainees accused of orchestrating the Sept. 11 attacks got underway again on Tuesday. But it took only a matter of hours for the hearing to run into yet another speed bump. Mohammed, the alleged architect of the terror plot, along with Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ammar al-Baluchi and Mustafa al Hawsawi, filed into the courtroom of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base\\'s \"Camp Justice,\" which hosts the military commissions, for the first time since the pandemic sidelined the military court. Seated with their defense teams, the men talked amongst each other and appeared engaged in their cases. Mohammed, known in recent years for his vibrantly colored facial hair, sported a bright orange beard along with thick black glasses. Some of the other defendants wore paramilitary attire. Each detainee spoke out only once during the hearing, affirming that they understood their rights. Mohammed answered \"yes,\" speaking in English. Bin al-Shibh also responded in English, while the other three men communicated through translators. While Mohammed has a reputation for courtroom outbursts, in a twist, it was the judge who became the central focus of the day\\'s hearing. As part of his debut on the bench in the proceedings, Col. Matthew McCall -- who was named to preside over the case last month -- conducted a review of his qualifications, opening himself up for questions from the prosecution and the defense. One of Mohammed\\'s attorneys, Gary Sowards, latched on to McCall\\'s circuitous route to his appointment. McCall was initially selected to oversee the trial last year, but withdrew after prosecutors objected, citing his lack of experience. He was reinstated after completing two years as a military judge, meeting the minimum requirement for the war court. Sowards questioned McCall on whether the prosecution\\'s complaints had resulted in undue influence over the judiciary, resulting in his temporary removal from the case. The defense argued that this allowed for another judge to step in and -- after a prolonged legal fight -- authorize the destruction of a CIA black site, a secret international prison where terror suspects were subjected to \"enhanced interrogation tactics\" like waterboarding, which many human rights organizations consider to be torture. During the questioning, McCall remained level, describing the situation as legally ambiguous in his estimation, but went along with the withdrawal to avoid complicating an already very complicated case. \"Why create an appellate issue? There are other judges who could do this case,\" he said. But moments later, the prosecution interrupted, informing the bench of a newly issued Military Commission Review on the exact topic of discussion. It determined that McCall could preside, but that all of the decisions he made before clocking two years of experience would be undone -- leaving only the ruling on the destruction of the black site in place. McCall dismissed the court several hours ahead of schedule to allow both sides to regroup and strategize. But James Connell, a civilian death penalty attorney representing al-Baluchi, needed little time to process the information. \"One of the most important issues in the case is how the torture of these men is going to ultimately affect the trial and trials mean evidence,\" Connell told reporters on the base. \"The intentional destruction of evidence takes away from the defense and really the American people, information about what actually happened.\" Connell said the defense plans to appeal the order, but lamented yet another delay in a trial that\\'s dragged on for nearly a decade. \"This order is one more example of why this process takes so long, because each issue has to be separately litigated,\" he continued. \"Things come up in this military commission that never come up anywhere else. Where else in the world does the Pentagon issue an order telling a judge how to decide a case? It just doesn\\'t happen anywhere else except here at Guantanamo.\"\\nResearchers found up to 10% less genetic diversity in the last 20 years. The outlook for the survival of polar bears appears precarious as scientists learn more about factors induced by climate change that are affecting the long-term health of the species. Polar bear populations studied in Svalbard, the Norwegian archipelago on the Barents Sea, were found to have up to a 10% loss in genetic diversity over a 20-year period, which correlated with a \"rapid disappearance of Arctic sea ice,\" according to a study published Wednesday in the Royal Society Journals. As the ice melted, the polar bears\\' habitat became fragmented, resulting in a rapid increase in genetic isolation and inbreeding among regions due to reduced contact with polar bears from the outside, scientists said. Scientists studied ecological and engineering data for the region from the Norwegian Polar Institute spanning two decades to investigate the population genetic trends in polar bears on the archipelago, author Simo Maduna of the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research, told ABC News. The results were \"alarming\" and \"surprising.\" \"We found a drastic reduction in genetic diversity over the 20-year period,\" Maduna said. \"And we could, in actual fact, associate this reduction in genetic diversity with the loss of sea ice.\" The species is \"in danger\" as a result of the inbreeding, as it could impact the fitness and health of the species and lead to even more declining populations, Maduna said. \"With genetic diversity, when the population becomes so small, you\\'ll find that there will be a higher chance of closely related individuals mating and producing offspring,\" he said. \"But with that comes a risk in the sense that some of the traits ... that are recessive, will now basically be unmasked in the population.\" The lack of genetic diversity could also eventually lead to the species\\' inability to produce fertile offspring or withstand disease, Maduna added. Polar bears are indigenous to the Arctic and are an ice-dependent species, but the erosion of the Arctic sea ice has been \"triggered by global warming,\" the researchers warned. The \"detrimental\" genetic changes are likely to become \"more severe\" in the future, the scientists said, further exacerbating the dire situation polar bears are facing. A 2020 study published in Nature Climate Change found that polar bears could be extinct by 2100 if Arctic ice continues to melt at projected rates. The authors of that study found that the carnivores could be starved into extinction within decades as the sea ice disappears and the bears lose their hunting ground. \"Polar bears are under various climatic pressures,\" Maduna said, encouraging individuals to \"adopt\" polar bears through various organizations to support the research to save them.\\nTen months on, the political landscape continues to be shaped by the \"big lie.\" The TAKE with Rick Klein For all the delays and the drama, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\\'s signature on his state\\'s GOP-backed voting reforms came with relatively little fanfare on Tuesday. While much of the action has been quiet, it\\'s striking to see how much of the political landscape continues to be shaped by the \"big lie\" told by former President Donald Trump and his supporters, a full 10 months after Trump lost. Including Texas, 17 Republican-controlled states have new voting restrictions in place in time for 2022 -- via bills at least partly inspired by the mistruths told by the former president. The so-called \"audit\" of last year\\'s election results in Arizona has still produced no formal results. It has, though, lingered long enough for some Republican leaders in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to launch copycat efforts. Trump\\'s steady stream of endorsements and statements have made clear that buying into his lies about the election are a prerequisite for his consideration. A rally coming together in Georgia later this month is sure to feature rehashing of false claims. It\\'s not just history, either: The leading Republican in next week\\'s California recall election is warning of \"shenanigans\" that he says could spark legal challenges in that race. And the Trump-endorsed GOP Senate candidate in Nevada has brought up possible preemptive legal challenges in his campaign -- where polls close in a mere 14 months. The rhetoric and many of the new laws are being met with lawsuits and anger among Democrats. But just as the Texas Democrats couldn\\'t stop their state\\'s law from being passed, national Democrats are no closer to passing the bills they have offered as their primary responses. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Biden toured neighborhoods in New York and New Jersey Tuesday that were damaged by remnants of Hurricane Ida, putting the spotlight on not only the nation\\'s aging infrastructure but also the continued threat climate change poses to communities. \"The evidence is clear. Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives, to our economy and the threat is here -- it\\'s not going to get any better,\" Biden said in Queens. \"The question is, \\'can it get worse?\\' We can stop it from getting worse.\" Biden used the trip to make the case for his infrastructure and economic plan, which includes efforts to address the impact of climate change. \"Climate change is here. We\\'re living through it now,\" Biden said at a briefing in New Jersey. \"I think we\\'re at one of those inflection points where we either act, or we\\'re gonna be in real, real trouble. Our kids are gonna be in real trouble.\" The trip comes as the administration works to get the bipartisan infrastructure deal to the president\\'s desk for signature. The larger $3.5 trillion spending bill Democrats are hoping to pass without Republicans through the budget reconciliation process faces an arduous path to passage, as moderate Democrats in the Senate oppose the large price tag. Platitudes about \"listening to the scientists\" and promises of future investment to shore up infrastructure to withstand extreme weather can only go so far while lawmakers duke it out in Washington. In the meantime, Americans across the country will be forced to continue digging themselves out of the rubble left behind by extreme weather. The TIP with Quinn Scanlan Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan has a vision -- and a warning -- for the Republican Party. Duncan imagines a GOP that\\'s empathetic and strikes a civil tone; that promises policy over slogans; that values truth and where the standard for inclusion is more than \"loyalty and subservience to\" Trump. \"Denialism, misinformation, and misplaced blame will not put a Republican back in the White House in 2024,\" Duncan writes in his book, \"GOP 2.0,\" out Tuesday. \"The GOP has a choice: Stop following this crazy path to nowhere or get used to losing.\" With four competitive statewide races on the ballot in 2022, his newly purple home turf is the test case for Duncan\\'s theory. Last week, Trump endorsed state Sen. Burt Jones in the primary to succeed Duncan. When it comes to the election, Jones and Duncan are polar opposites. Duncan, one of the first Republicans to call out Trump\\'s lies for what they are, stripped several senators of their committee chairmanships, in part, he writes, for \"aggressively spreading untrue and debunked fraud claims.\" Jones was one of them. Jones winning the primary, where he faces the three-term senate president pro tempore, would signal how influential Trump remains among Georgia Republicans. But if he, and other Trump loyalists, go on to lose the general, the party may be better served in the long run by revisiting Duncan\\'s vision of a GOP 2.0 than following in Trump\\'s footsteps by crying fraud.

Forty-one percent instead say the United States has become less safe since 9/11, reflecting both renewed partisan divisions and the tumultuous withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan.

Kennedy, says assassin Sirhan Sirhan should not be released from prison, further roiling a family divide over whether the man convicted of killing her husband in California in 1968 should be freed on parole. In a brief statement released on Twitter by her daughter, lawyer and activist Kerry Kennedy, Ethel Kennedy said bluntly Tuesday: \"He should not be paroled.\" \"Bobby believed we should work to \\'tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of the world,\" Kennedy, 93, wrote. \"He wanted to end the war in Vietnam and bring people together to build a better, stronger country. More than anything, he wanted to be a good father and loving husband,\" she wrote, adding: \"Our family and our country suffered an unspeakable loss due to the inhumanity of one man. We believe in the gentleness that spared his life, but in taming his act of violence, he should not have the opportunity to terrorize again.\" Ethel Kennedy founded the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. Her statement came a week after former U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, RFK\\'s oldest son, also denounced the possible parole of Sirhan, 77. Two other RFK offspring, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Douglas Kennedy, have said they support the release. The California Parole Board found last month that Sirhan no longer poses a threat to society, noting that he had enrolled in more than 20 programs including anger management classes, tai chi and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Sirhan has served 53 years of a life sentence. The ruling will be reviewed over the next four months by the boards staff. Then it will be sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who will have 30 days to decide whether to grant it, reverse it or modify it. Robert F. Kennedy was a U.S. senator from New York and the brother of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963. RFK was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination when he was gunned down at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles moments after delivering a victory speech in the pivotal California primary. Five others were wounded.\\nFormer Republican officeholders and election experts say that the GOP-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election in Wisconsin lacks credibility, transparency and raises security risks and legal concerns MADISON, Wis. -- Former Republican officeholders and elections experts said Wednesday that the GOP-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election in Wisconsin lacks credibility, transparency and raises security risks and legal concerns. And a Republican Wisconsin lawmaker who heads the state Senate\\'s election committee separately defended the integrity of the state\\'s election process after a two-hour informational hearing attended by other Republicans who have pushed for investigations. \"Im sorry, but there is not a reason to spread misinformation about this past election when we have all the evidence that shows otherwise,\" state Sen. Kathy Bernier said after after she led a tutorial at the state Capitol for legislators and their their staffs about how the states elections function. That included a demonstration of voting equipment. Former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Kentucky\\'s former secretary of state, Trey Grayson, said the ongoing investigation in Wisconsin, like one in Arizona, are part of disinformation campaigns and threats to democracy. \"Its clear these are bad faith efforts, not fact-finding missions but rather political stunts to keep the lies of the 2020 election alive,\" said Whitman, who served in former President George W. Bush\\'s Cabinet. Grayson, who is also a Republican, said now was the time to build trust in elections, not spread conspiracy theories. \"I worry about the future of election security and the future of the Republican Party,\" Grayson said. Both he and Whitman spoke during a conference call organized by the nonpartisan group States United Democracy Center, which advocates for free, fair and secure elections. President Joe Biden defeated former President Donald Trump by more than 20,000 votes in Wisconsin. The results were upheld following recounts in Milwaukee and Dane counties and through numerous state and federal lawsuits filed by Trump and his supporters. Still, Republicans have questioned numerous aspects of the 2020 election but have produced no evidence of widespread fraud while calling for a broader \"forensic audit.\" To date, only two people out of 3.3 million votes cast in Wisconsin have been charged with election fraud. Wisconsin Republicans ordered a review by the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau, which was to release its findings this fall. But under pressure from conservatives for a broader review, Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos hired former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman to lead a separate investigation. Gableman, a conservative, has a budget of $676,000 to hire investigators and do a data analysis on election results. What form that data analysis will take, and whether county leaders would turn over sensitive information without a court order, remains to be seen. Gableman in November told a crowd of Trump supporters in Milwaukee that, \"Our elected leaders -- your elected leaders -- have allowed unelected bureaucrats at the Wisconsin Elections Commission to steal our vote.\" Gableman also traveled to Arizona to talk with officials about the investigation there, and he attended a symposium in South Dakota organized by MyPillow founder Mike Lindell that included presentations by advocates of election conspiracy theories. Elections officials in Milwaukee and Brown counties last week rejected subpoenas issued by Assembly Elections Committee Chair Rep. Janel Brandtjen that sought access to ballots and voting machines. The subpoenas were not signed by Vos or the Assembly\\'s chief clerk, as required by law, leading the county election clerks to reject them. Brown County Attorney David Hemery also voiced concerns about what steps would be taken to ensure the security of all the information requested. Republican efforts questioning the outcome of the 2020 presidential race have led to voting system breaches that election security experts say pose a heightened risk to future elections. States United Democracy Center released a memo Wednesday comparing the Wisconsin probe with the widely discredited Arizona audit led by Cyber Ninjas, a small cybersecurity firm based in Florida picked to lead the review. \"We should not allow unqualified and hyper-partisan actors to make a mockery of official election procedures and sow doubt about our democracy,\" the bipartisan group co-chaired and founded by Whitman wrote. Neither Vos nor Brandtjen have experience in administering official audits or ballot counts, which raises more security concerns, the report stated. Vos and Brandtjen did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Whitman said the goal is to sow distrust in elections so that legislatures are empowered to change voting laws and make it possible to overturn results in 2022 and 2024 that they dont like. \"This is a real threat to our democracy,\" she said. \"It is happening across the country. Its not something that just popped up.\"\\nA Florida judge has ruled the state cannot enforce its ban on mask mandates in public schools to guard against the coronavirus while an appeals court sorts out whether the ban is ultimately legal ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- A Florida judge ruled Wednesday that the state cannot enforce a ban on public schools mandating the use of masks to guard against the coronavirus, while an appeals court sorts out whether the ban is ultimately legal. Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper lifted an automatic stay of his decision last week that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and state education officials exceeded their authority by imposing the blanket ban through executive order and tagging defiant pro-mask local school boards with financial penalties. Cooper said the overwhelming evidence before him in a lawsuit by parents challenging the DeSantis ban is that wearing masks does provide some protection for children in crowded school settings, particularly those under 12 for whom no vaccine yet exists. The issue came to a head amid a recent surge in cases caused by the more contagious and deadly delta variant of the virus, which health statistics show has begun to wane. \"We\\'re not in normal times. We are in a pandemic,\" Cooper said during a hearing held remotely. \"We have a (coronavirus) variant that is more infectious and dangerous to children than the one we had last year.\" Since DeSantis signed the mandatory mask ban order on July 30, 13 school boards representing more than half of Florida\\'s 2.8 million students have adopted mask requirements with an opt-out only for medical reasons. State education officials have begun going after rebellious school board members\\' salaries as a form of punishment. Jacob Oliva, public schools chancellor at the state Department of Education, said in a notice last week to local superintendents that \"enforcement must cease if the stay is lifted.\" That includes the effort to dock salaries of school board members or impose other financial penalties. The case next goes before the 1st District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee. DeSantis said at an appearance Wednesday in Palm Harbor that he is confident the state will prevail. The matter could ultimately be decided by the Florida Supreme Court. The core of the governor\\'s argument is that the recently passed Parents Bill of Rights gives decision-making authority to parents on whether their children should wear a mask to school. \"What weve found is in the trial courts in Tallahassee, state and federal, we typically lose if theres a political component to it, but then in the appeals court we almost always win,\" the governor said. Cooper seemed to go out of his way to point out that he has frequently ruled in favor of Florida governors in the past, including cases involving GOP Govs. Jeb Bush and Rick Scott. Cooper has been a Leon County circuit judge since he was first elected in 2002. \"If you look at my record, its not somebody who runs all over the place, ruling against the governor,\" Cooper said. \"This case has generated a lot of heat and a lot of light.\" On the Parents Bill of Rights, Cooper said his previous order follows the law as passed earlier this year by the Legislature. The law, he said, reserves health and education decisions regarding children to parents unless a government entity such as a school board can show their broader action is reasonable and narrowly tailored to the issue at hand. The DeSantis order impermissibly enforces only the first portion of that law, Cooper said. \"You have to show you have authority to do what you\\'re doing,\" the judge said. \"You cannot enforce part of that law but not all of it.\" In a separate case, parents of special needs children have filed a federal lawsuit claiming the DeSantis mandatory school mask ban violates the Americans with Disabilities Act by placing their medically sensitive children in jeopardy. A federal judge in Miami did not immediately rule after a hearing Wednesday in that case. Additionally, school officials in Broward, Alachua and Orange counties filed a petition to schedule a hearing before an administrative law judge. According to the filing, the local school officials want the judge to invalidate a state health department emergency rule against school mask requirements based on the governors executive order. ---------- Associated Press writer Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee contributed to this story.\\nDiver and seal share adorable moment A scuba diver and a gray seal enjoyed an underwater cuddle in a sweet encounter off the coast of Englands Farne Islands.\\nNaval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- Twenty years after 9/11, the trial of the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is set to resume once again after a series of delays, including the coronavirus pandemic. Mohammed will be joined by four co-defendants in pretrial proceedings as a new judge presides over the military commission nearly 20 years after 2,977 people were killed at the World Trade Center, Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The moment is primed to create headlines as the legal process resumes not only days before the 20th anniversary of the attacks, but also less than two weeks after the U.S. military completed its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. It is also fraught with a sense of justice delayed for years, charged battles over whether civilian or military authorities should try the cases and of course, the fight over the infamous Guantanamo Bay complex itself, where a number of those swept up in the war on terror were held indefinitely. Also at issue is how much the public will learn and when. With concerns about classified information, images and transcripts from the courtroom, while in public view, will be tightly controlled and the proceedings could be halted for national security reasons. After this pretrial phase Sept. 7-17, another pretrial continuation is set for Nov. 1-19. There could be additional pretrial phases added after that, at the discretion of the judge. After that, the military commission will go through a process that could last two months to select military officers to serve as panel members. The trial itself could begin as soon as next April, although a date is not yet definite. Mohammed and his codefendants face capital charges that could carry the death penalty if convicted. Approximately 15 reporters received a tour Sunday afternoon of the Expeditionary Legal Complex (ELC) at Camp Justice, where the hearings will take place. Here\\'s what we learned about the courtroom and proceedings, and how we got to this point: A nearly decade-long detention The defendants in this case were arraigned in 2012, but have yet to truly see their day in court because of a numerous delays in the pretrial process. One of the key issues to be decided before the trial can begin is what evidence will be admissible. The defendants were held in secret prisons abroad, called CIA black sites, before they were transferred to the Guantanamo facility. There, they were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques, which many human rights organizations and the defense teams argue are tantamount to torture. Accounts obtained after the prisoners came to Guantanamo are also in question. Defense lawyers contend that their clients were already conditioned to give their interrogators the answers they wanted to hear. The court itself has also undergone many changes during the duration of the trial. Established by former President George W. Bush in 2001, the Guantanamo military commission was revised via Congressional act in 2006 and later amended through the legislative branch again in 2009. Former President Obama attempted to transfer detainees to the U.S., but was effectively blocked by Congress. Critics have argued the military court is unconstitutional and unjust because the accused are denied the right to due process and a speedy trial. The courtroom There is a sound-proof gallery where 53 reporters and family members of 9/11 victims and survivors of the terrorist attacks can watch the proceedings through sound-proof glass. A blue curtain separates family members of victims or 9/11 survivors from the press, if they wish to pull it closed for privacy. The proceedings can also be observed by members of the public at Fort Meade, Maryland via closed-circuit TV. If classified material is raised during the trial, the judge or trial judiciary staff, such as a court information security officer, or CISO, could stop the closed-circuit feed - cutting off the presentation before any classified information is revealed publicly. The prosecution could also preemptively invoke national security to disrupt the defenses argument even before any classified information is actually revealed. The courtroom - built specifically for the trial of the 9/11 defendants, cost $12 million to construct in 2008 and is basically a renovated warehouse. Despite rhetoric by the Obama and Biden administrations promising to \"close GITMO\" - that discussion is really only about ending the detainee program, and the Naval Station, which has been under U.S. control through a lease with the Cuban government since 1903 is not in jeopardy of closing. After visiting the gallery, reporters were taken into the large courtroom - approximately 100 feet by 100 feet - if not a little bigger. The defendants have not been in the courtroom since early 2020 - just before the COVID-19 pandemic began. In addition to Mohammed, four other defendants charged in the 9/11 terrorist attacks will be in the courtroom: Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ammar al-Baluchi (also known as Abd al Aziz Ali) and Mustafa al Hawsawi. The defendants will sit at five tables alongside their defense teams and interpreters - with Mohammed in the front - and his alleged co-conspirators seated from front-to-back in the order listed on the indictment and above. Col. Matthew McCall will preside, becoming the fourth judge to sit on the bench during the pretrial proceedings. McCall was initially selected to oversee the trial last year, but withdrawn after prosecutors objected, citing his lack of experience. He was reinstated after completing two years as a military judge, meeting the minimum requirement for the war court. At the base of each seat for the defendants are chains anchored into the carpet that could potentially be hooked to shackles if the judge determines a defendant must be restrained, although Wendy Kelly -- chief of operations at the Office of Military Commissions Guantanamo Bay -- did not believe this would be needed. There is also a hospital bed positioned in the back of the courtroom for a defendant in another trial. A sixth table was built in the courtroom for a prospective sixth 9/11 defendant, although it will likely be unoccupied since the defendant was not indicted. Timetable and priority on classified information Protecting classified intelligence is a priority during the hearings. Information about events, location and timing could appear to be innocuous but combine to present a classified narrative. Kelly said the defendants have frequently sought to delay the proceedings by revealing classified information and details that they are privy to themselves. The military commission is expected to have an open session all day Tuesday and a closed session on Wednesday, when none of the defendants will be permitted in the courtroom as the judge, defense and prosecution have a classified session. On Thursday, the court is expected to have an open session for a half day, and then another closed session on Friday. The pretrial proceedings are set to resume the following Monday and potentially carry on through Sept. 17. What happens next is largely up to the discretion of the judge. He is expected to hold additional pretrial hearings later this year, but jury selection will not begin until 2022 at the earliest. No video or audio from the courtroom will be released publicly, although an unofficial courtroom transcript will be posted approximately one day later, depending on the length of the proceedings and any potential security review for classification. There will be a sketch artist, who will be present in the soundproof gallery to draw images of the defendants in the courtroom. Kelly said that steps will be taken in the gallery to observe social distancing - with all attendees required to wear face masks. The judge must still determine whether to socially distance the defendants and their defense teams or ask them to wear masks. Four out of five of the 9/11 defendants accepted an offer to receive vaccinations against COVID-19, and some personnel on the base have tested positive for the disease. Approximately 10 remote-controlled video cameras are mounted on the walls and ceilings of the courtroom and Kelly assured ABC News that there are no hidden cameras in the courtroom. To the far right of the courtroom is a box for the panel members - who serve as a jury and will be comprised of 12 military officers, with four alternates (although six may ultimately be chosen). The pool of prospective jurors is comprised of hundreds of officers from all branches of the service. They are not expected to be sequestered during the trial, but may be asked by the judge not to read or view media reports on the trial, or the conduct interviews with the media. Kelly predicted it could take up to two months to vet and select prospective jurors. Along the right side of the courtroom are several tables for the prosecution, which is also comprised of U.S. citizens - some civilian and some military. There is a podium in the middle of the courtroom that has a laptop computer and microphone. The podium swivels 360 degrees, so any speaker may turn to address the panel of military officers serving as the jury, for example. There will be five 9/11 victim family members or survivors of the terrorist attacks - and each may bring one guest to accompany them in the gallery, as well as VFM (Victim Family Member) escorts. No recordings are allowed - so military security is present to ensure that nobody breaks the rules imposed by the military commission. The detainees After viewing the courtroom, journalists were taken outside to view holding cells where the defendants will be detained during any recesses in the proceedings, as well as immediately before the days proceedings commence. Reporters were permitted to peer into the cells but were prohibited from fully entering for security reasons. Kelly said that detainees, who are held at the Joint Task Force miles from the courtroom, will be awoken about 5 a.m. each day, and then taken to the holding cells about 6:30 a.m. There are five cells, numbered ELC14 through ELC18. Inside each is a mounted bed with a foam cushion resting on a mattress. There are no sheets, after several detainees died by suicide years ago. The cells also have a toilet and a Qibla pointer -- an arrow that points toward Islams holiest site - the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Monitors provide a closed-circuit feed to the defendants in each cell, if they decide not to remain in the courtroom or are removed for some reason. There is also a larger holding cell nearby that can accommodate meetings with more members of the defense team. Between the larger holding cell and the five cells is another small building with a shower. There was also a make-shift shower positioned between cells ELC14 and ELC15. This was built on the site in case any of the defendants have to stay overnight at the ELC, and then later a more modern shower facility with additional privacy was added. A thick black netting is designed to prevent anyone from the outside to see movements within. There was a long corridor leading from the detention cells to the courtroom, which the defendants will have to traverse in order to enter the courtroom. Another building within the ELC is ready for any evidence introduced or entered into the record at the hearings - complete with digital servers. Nearly all of the evidence is digitally presented, although Kelly said there will also be physical evidence presented from the sites of the terrorist attacks. That physical evidence is possessed by the FBI in a locker across a courtyard in the ELC.\\nNearly half say the U.S. has changed for the worse since the attacks. Just 49% of Americans see the United States as safer from terrorism than it was before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, down from 64% a decade ago, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. Forty-one percent instead say the United States has become less safe since 9/11, reflecting both renewed partisan divisions and the tumultuous withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan. A vast 86% in this poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, also say the events of Sept. 11 had a lasting effect on the United States. But underscoring the public\\'s sour mood on this issue, 46%, a new high, say it\\'s been a change for the worse. That easily exceeds the 33% who see a change for the better, half as many as said so in spring 2002. See PDF for full results, charts, and tables. Shifts Views of the country\\'s security from terrorism have shifted sharply across the years, given both international developments and partisan U.S. politics. Confidence peaked in 2003 and 2004, fell steeply in 2005 after the London transit bombings, held especially high among Republicans during the Bush administration, plummeted among Republicans two years later under the Obama administration, then rose sharply across groups after the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011. Ten years later, the latest decline may reflect multiple factors, including pessimism after the fall of Afghanistan and Republican-led dissatisfaction with the Biden administration. Specifically, compared with 2011, the sense that the country is safer from terrorism now than it was before 9/11 is down 28 percentage points among Republicans, to 41%, compared with a slight 9-point decrease among Democrats, to 57%. It\\'s down 12 points among independents, to 52%. The see-saws have been dramatic: These patterns are mirrored in terms of political ideology, with 59% of moderates and 55% of liberals currently seeing improved safety, versus just 39% of conservatives. Just 16% of Americans overall say the country is \"much\" safer from terrorism, again near all-time lows. An additional 33% of Americans call it safer, but just somewhat so. Those who see the country as less safe divide evenly, 21% somewhat less safe, 20% much less. There\\'s another partisan split here, with 36% of Republicans saying the country is much less safe from terrorism than before 9/11, versus 15% of independents and 11% of Democrats. Another result shows that 9/11 isn\\'t unique in its perceived impact. About as many Americans, 82%, say the coronavirus pandemic will change the country in a lasting way as say this about 9/11. And, also similar to current views on 9/11, 50% call it a change for the worse. Groups Partisan differences narrow when considering the lasting effects of the 9/11 attacks. Thirty-one to 36% of Republicans, Democrats and independents alike say the country has changed for the better, while 43% to 49% say it\\'s changed for the worse. But these gaps widen by ideology, with liberals most likely to say the country has changed for the worse, 59%, versus 44% of moderates and 45% of conservatives. Beyond partisan and ideological differences, 57% of older Americans say the country is less safe from terrorism post 9/11, versus 37% of those younger than 65. Men are more likely than women to say the country has changed for the worse, 53% versus 40%, as are college graduates compared with those without a degree, 55% to 41%.

Last week, Texas passed the strictest anti-abortion legislation in the nation, effectively nulling Roe v. Wade. The law blocks abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. It also empowers whistleblowers to report and sue anyone aiding an abortion, including doctors and Uber drivers who may have no knowledge of the situation. Much of the discourse from candidates over the course of this campaign cycle has focused on COVID-19, homelessness and climate change. Though Republican challengers have offered dramatically different approaches to handling these crises, their responses haven\\'t energized voters as much as Democrats had hoped. Now, following Texas\\' abortion ban, Democrats are turning their focus to the issue, sending a stark warning to voters: California could be next if Gov. Gavin Newsom loses. \"The fight that\\'s going on nationally, has come to California,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in an exclusive interview with ABC News\\' Zohreen Shah during a campaign stop with Newsom. \"That\\'s why this is the moment to vote no on the recall.\" Newsom added, \"Imagine the judges a Republican governor will appoint. Imagine the ability to use the line item veto to cut expansions of reproductive rights and health care for women. Imagine a governor from the state of California joining Republican governors on amicus brief supporting overturning Roe v. Wade or using the bully pulpit nationally to advance that cause I think it could be profoundly consequential.\" A reality check on California politics might prove otherwise, though. California has some of the strongest abortion protections in the nation, so if Newsom were to be recalled, his successor would face a variety of obstacles trying to enact a major consequential anti-abortion legislation. Notably, the legislation would have to go up against a heavy Democratic majority in the state legislature and the governor would only have until the end of the term in 2022 to do it. However, that has not stopped some Republican candidates from taking stances about stripping funding from health services that provide abortions and trying to overturn Roe v. Wade. Republican frontrunner and conservative radio host Larry Elder called Roe v. Wade \"one of the worst decisions that the Supreme Court ever handed down\" in an interview with San Francisco radio station KQED in July. Anti-abortion activist Lila Rose threw her support behind Elder in a series of tweets last week. She said, in part, that the Elder campaign promised to use line-item veto to cut all abortion funding and veto all abortion expansions. During an appearance on CNN\\'s \"New Day\" this week, former Olympian and TV personality Caitlyn Jenner said she supports Texas\\' decision because she believes states should have the ability to make their own laws -- but she still thinks women should have the right to choose whether or not to give birth. As it relates to California, Jenner said, \"I don\\'t see any changes in our laws in California in the future.\" Others, aware of California\\'s political landscape, are calling out Newsom\\'s alleged strategy of using the issue of abortion to vilify his Republican opponents. \"It\\'s not that big of an issue in California because California, you know, has constitutional protection,\" businessman John Cox told ABC News. \"So the politicians are using it. Mr. Newsom is using it to scare people right now.\" Some Republicans, like former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, have complicated Newsom\\'s alleged efforts to try to paint his Republican challengers as anti-abortion. Faulconer told ABC News, \"I\\'ve been pro-choice ... I\\'ve always been and I will continue to be that way.\" While the effectiveness of Newsom\\'s strategy will play out at the ballot box on Sept. 14, one thing is for certain: The fight for access to reproductive rights is far from over. Each party appears determined to use the controversial issue to energize their base as the 2022 midterms quickly approach. ABC News\\' Zohreen Shah contributed to this report.\\nTexas suing 6 school districts over mask mandates The Texas attorney general has filed lawsuits against six school districts that mandate masks, the office said Friday. The lawsuits target the school districts of Richardson, Round Rock, Galveston, Elgin, Spring and Sherman for flouting Gov. Greg Abbotts executive order prohibiting local entities from requiring masks -- what Texas Attorney General Ken Paxon referred to in a statement as \"acts of political defiance.\" In a statement to ABC News, Sylvia Wood, a spokesperson for Spring Independent School District, said the district had yet to be served and had no details about the lawsuit beyond a press release. \"Spring ISD will let the legal process unfold and allow the courts to decide the merits of the case,\" Wood said. Elgin Independent School District Superintendent Jodi Duron also told ABC News the school district had not been served yet, and that schools in Travis County, part of Elgin ISD, are required to have students wear masks. \"To the Districts knowledge, the Travis County Order has not been suspended,\" she said. Round Rock Independent School District spokesperson Jenny LaCoste-Caputo told ABC News the school district is following Texas Education Agency guidance that allows for mask requirements \"for adults or students for whom it is developmentally appropriate\" and is working with local authorities \"who advise us that masks remain an essential tool in stemming the spread of COVID-19 in our classrooms.\" Sherman Independent School District told ABC News in a statement that it had not received any information on the lawsuit yet and for now \"will continue to focus on promoting a safe and healthy learning environment for our students and staff.\" ABC News has reached out to the other school districts for comment. Nearly 90 school districts currently have mask mandates, according to a list compiled by Paxton\\'s office. The attorney general anticipates more lawsuits if school districts \"continue to defy state law,\" his office said in a statement. Several school districts have sued the state to challenge the ban on mask mandates. Last week, the Texas Education Agency said it is not enforcing the governor\\'s executive order \"as the result of ongoing litigation.\"\\nRICHMOND, Va. -- A statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee that towered over Richmond for generations was taken down, cut into pieces and hauled away Wednesday, as the former capital of the Confederacy erased the last of the Civil War figures that once defined its most prominent thoroughfare. Hundreds of onlookers erupted in cheers and song as the 21-foot-tall bronze figure was lifted off a pedestal and lowered to the ground. The removal marked a major victory for civil rights activists, whose previous calls to dismantle the statues had been steadfastly rebuked by city and state officials alike. \"Its very difficult to imagine, certainly, even two years ago that the statues on Monument Avenue would actually be removed,\" said Ana Edwards, a community activist and founding member of the Virginia Defenders for Freedom Justice & Equality. \"Its representative of the fact that were sort of peeling back the layers of injustice that Black people and people of color have experienced when governed by white supremacist policies for so long.\" Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam ordered the statues removal last summer amid the nationwide protest movement that erupted after the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. But litigation tied up his plans until the state Supreme Court cleared the way last week. Northam, who watched the work, called it \"hopefully a new day, a new era in Virginia.\" \"Any remnant like this that glorifies the lost cause of the Civil War, it needs to come down,\" he said. The 21-foot (6-meter) bronze sculpture was installed in 1890 atop a granite pedestal about twice that tall. The sculpture was perched in the middle of a state-owned traffic circle, and it stood among four other massive Confederate statues that were removed by the city last summer. A construction worker who strapped harnesses around Lee and his horse lifted his arms in the air and counted, \"Three, two, one!\" to jubilant shouts from the crowd as the crane prepared to wrest the statue away. Some chanted \"Whose streets? Our streets!\" and sang, \"Hey, hey, hey, goodbye.\" Once the statue was on the ground, the crew used a power saw to cut it in two along the generals waist, so that it could be hauled under highway overpasses to an undisclosed state-owned facility until a decision is made about its future. The job was overseen by Team Henry Enterprises, led by Devon Henry, a Black executive who faced death threats after his companys role in removing Richmonds other Confederate statues was made public last year. He said the Lee statue posed their most complex challenge. Within hours, the pieces were gone. They were hauled away on a flatbed truck to cheers from the remaining crowd and claps of thunder from a midday storm. The pedestal is to remain for now, although workers are expected to remove a time capsule from the structure on Thursday. The work proceeded under a heavy police presence, with streets closed for blocks around the area, but no arrests were reported, and no counter protesters emerged. Those who opposed the statues removal often noted its artistic significance and Virginias centrality to the Civil War. They argued that taking the statues down would amount to erasing a key part of the commonwealths history. As recently as several years ago, key government officials argued for keeping it in place. After a rally of white supremacists in the city of Charlottesville erupted into violence in 2017, other Confederate monuments started falling around the country. But at the time, local governments in Virginia were hamstrung by a state law protecting memorials to war veterans. That law was amended by the new Democratic majority at the Statehouse and signed by Northam, allowing localities to decide the monuments fate as of July 1, 2020. Del. Delores McQuinn, a Democrat whose district includes Richmond and who sponsored the 2020 war memorial legislation, said she used to avoid driving on Monument Avenue because she found the statues so offensive. Seeing Lee come down Wednesday was \"surreal,\" she said. \"The fight, the struggle ... hopefully some of the ancestors feel vindicated,\" said McQuinn, who is Black and has been an outspoken advocate for a better telling of Richmonds Black history in public spaces. State Sen. Jennifer McClellan, who represents Richmond and lives in the neighborhood, said the idea of the removal had long felt \"impossible,\" though that began to shift after Floyds murder, when the area around the statute became a hub for the growing protest movement and saw occasional clashes between police and demonstrators. The pedestal has been covered by constantly evolving, colorful graffiti, with many of the hand-painted messages denouncing police and demanding an end to systemic racism and inequality. \"I physically felt in the air hope, if that makes sense, because I saw multigenerational, multiracial people chanting to take it down and demanding change,\" said McClellan, who is Black. The changes to Monument Avenue have remade the prestigious boulevard, which is lined with mansions and tony apartments and is partly preserved as a National Historic Landmark district. Northam, who after a 2019 scandal involving a racist photo in his medical school yearbook pledged to spend the rest of his term addressing Virginias racial inequalities, has tapped the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts to lead a community-driven redesign for the whole avenue. Christy S. Coleman, executive director of the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation and the former president and chief operating officer of the American Civil War Museum in Richmond, said she saw Wednesdays removal as a historical moment in the citys long-running struggle with how to tell its history. That effort \"is perfectly normal for communities to do -- question who and what they are, what they value and how they want those values to be reflected, not only in the landscape, but in its laws,\" she said.\\nRepublicans in Americas largest conservative state for years racked up victories under the slogan \"Keep Texas Red,\" a pledge to quash a coming blue wave that Democrats argued was inevitable given shifting demographics AUSTIN, Texas -- Republicans in America\\'s largest conservative state for years racked up victories under the slogan \"Keep Texas Red,\" a pledge to quash a coming blue wave that Democrats argued was inevitable given shifting demographics. Now, those population transformations have arrived, with the 2020 census confirming that the state got bigger, more suburban and far more diverse. Yet a more apt state GOP rallying cry for today might be \"Make Texas Even Redder.\" Faced with increasingly dire demographic threats to their partys dominance, Texas Republicans have championed a bevy of boundary-pushing conservative policymaking that dramatically expands gun rights, curbs abortions and tightens election laws -- steering a state that was already far to the right even more so. Far from tiptoeing toward the middle to appease the Democratic-leaning Texans driving population growth, the party is embracing its base and vowing to use a new round of redistricting to ensure things stay that way through 2030 -- becoming a national model for staying on the offensive no matter how political winds may eventually shift. \"Texas, obviously, is a national leader as it concerns the laws that we pass and other states follow,\" Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is fond of vowing to make Texas the \"freedom capital of America,\" said Tuesday. Abbott, who is up for reelection next year and often mentioned as a possible 2024 presidential contender, signed voting legislation Tuesday that empowers partisan poll watchers and prohibits a host of measures that made casting ballots easier in heavily Democratic cities amid the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans argue that the new rules boost election security and charged ahead to pass them, even as Democratic state lawmakers fled the state for weeks to block them. The voting law was nearly overshadowed by national debate over another new Texas law -- the nation\\'s toughest set of abortion restrictions. By banning the procedure in most instances and leaving no exceptions for cases of rape and incest, the state has mounted perhaps the strongest threat yet to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision establishing a woman\\'s right to an abortion. Another new law allows virtually any Texan age 21 and older to carry guns without licenses. Other legislation banned schools from teaching about institutional racism and limited the states own cities from making decisions on police funding, environmental budgeting and mask mandates. And on Tuesday, Abbott instructed lawmakers to once again try passing restrictions on transgender student athletes when the Legislature convenes later this month to begin drawing new voting maps. These policy victories are poised to become cemented for the foreseeable future. Because Republicans control both chambers of the Legislature, the party will decide new congressional and statehouse districts based on 2020 census figures -- seeking to make the boundaries as favorable as possible so the GOP can hold statehouse majorities for the next decade and beyond. The new maps will have to counteract what looks to be unfavorable census data for Texas Republicans. The state\\'s Hispanic population grew by nearly 2 million, according to 2020 census figures, accounting for half of Texas\\' total population increase. Even as the GOP made gains with Hispanic voters, about 6 in 10 Hispanics in Texas chose Democrat Joe Biden over Republican Donald Trump in November, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the electorate. Republicans also see warning signs in the suburbs. The state is home to four of the nations 10 fastest-growing cities, fueled by booming communities outside Houston, Dallas and Austin. After years of GOP advantages in these places, Biden split suburban voters in Texas with Trump, AP VoteCast found, and won the state\\'s five largest counties. Democrats blame the unfettered conservativism on Trumpism. The former president ushered in \"a new Republican Party that is more feisty. Its more fringe,\" said Democratic state Rep. Ron Reynolds, vice chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus. \"The cows left the barn, and its hard to put it back,\" said Reynolds, whose district includes booming suburban Houston. \"They have to entertain and they have to appease because these are the people that are excited about voting in Republican primaries.\" Democrats like Reynolds warn there will be voter backlash. But they have little history to back that up: Republicans haven\\'t lost a statewide race in 27 years and say it is a fierce commitment to conservativism, not pragmatic compromise, that has preserved the nation\\'s longest electoral winning streak. \"If anyone expected that, their head is way too far up their, uh, philosophy,\" Corbin Casteel, the Trump campaigns Texas director in 2016, joked about any notion that census figures might make the state\\'s Republicans move to the center. Even more moderate Texas Republicans say past pronouncements about changing demographics helping Democrats were overblown. \"The rumors of our demise have been greatly exaggerated,\" said state Rep. Travis Clardy of Nacogdoches in east Texas. \"We keep winning with really strong numbers,\" Clardy added. \"I dont think weve had strident, extreme, right-wing positions. I think weve governed conservatively.\" Still, the party has shown a capacity for moderation in the not-too-distant past. After a Democratic wave swept Texas and the nation in 2018, the GOP had an exceedingly quiet legislative session, focusing on traditional issues like property tax cuts and public education. It was only after the party held the Legislature and gained seats in Congress last November that it turned hard right -- anticipating that its members\\' biggest electoral threat going forward is primary challenges rather than being unseated by Democrats. \"Ive heard that all this demographic change is going to catch up to the party of the old white people, but I dont think its happened,\" Clardy said. \"The numbers may be changing, but they may not be trending the way they think that they are.\" The move to the right is perhaps best illustrated by Abbott, a former state Supreme Court justice who was once considered to have a more measured and deliberative, business-friendly approach to the job but has lately gone even further right than the Legislature -- particularly on immigration. The governor recently ordered state police to arrest people suspected of being in the country illegally and directed a state agency to pony up $25 million for 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) of wall along Texas nearly 1,200-mile (1,930-kilometer) border with Mexico. No major Democrat has yet announced a candidacy against Abbott, though former presidential candidate Beto ORourke -- who came within 3 percentage points of upsetting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 -- still might. The governor has already drawn a primary challenge from former congressman Allen West, a onetime tea party darling known for likening Democrats to Nazis. Casteel said doubling down on conservative values is working for Republicans in Texas and beyond. He pointed to Abbott and another governor and possible 2024 presidential candidate, Republican Ron DeSantis of Florida. Both have gained national followings by being willing to combat unpopular policies like universal mask mandates. That\\'s despite Democrats in both states insisting the governors\\' failure to more strenuously battle the pandemic could ultimately jeopardize their aspirations for reelection -- not to mention the White House. \"Hes faced circumstances that few governors have, with the pandemic and all sorts of other things that put conservatives in a tough bind,\" Casteel said of Abbott. \"Its safety versus liberty and he -- and folks like Gov. DeSantis -- theyve threaded that needle very nicely. And I think the results are speaking for themselves.\" ------ Weissert reported from Washington.\\nThe sky was clear and blue. The gray towers stood, both guarding and welcoming, at the gateway to the nation. Out of nowhere came the impact, the blaze, the smoke -- and then the towers were gone. When the dust and flames finally cleared, a new world had emerged. The death and destruction defined that late summer day and remain seared in the minds of those who lived through Sept. 11, 2001. From the ashes and wreckage rose a new America: a society redefined by its scars and marked by a new wartime reality -- a shadow darkened even more in recent days by the resurgence of fundamentalist Islamist rule in the far-off land that hatched the attacks. Twenty years later -- with more than 70 million Americans born since the crucible of the attacks -- the legacy of 9/11 remains. From airport security to civilian policing to the most casual parts of daily life, it would be nearly impossible to identify something that remains untouched and unaffected by those terrifying hours in 2001. This week, ABC News revisits the 9/11 attacks and unwinds their aftermath, taking a deep look at the America born in the wake of destruction. \"9/11 Twenty Years Later: The Longest Shadow\" is a five-part documentary series narrated by George Stephanopoulos. Episodes will air on ABC News Live each night leading up to the 20th anniversary of the attacks, from Sept. 6-10. The series will be rebroadcast in full following the commemoration ceremonies on Saturday, Sept. 11. Part 3: Wars in a far-off land \"America is under attack,\" White House Chief of Staff Andy Card whispered into the ear of his boss, President George W. Bush, during a photo-op at a school in Florida. Moments before, hijacked jetliners had careened into the World Trade Center\\'s Twin Towers in New York City. The fallout would mobilize part of a new generation of Americans to answer the call of duty -- and join a pair of \"forever wars\" half a world away. Among those who felt the pull was recently retired U.S. Navy SEAL officer Dan O\\'Shea. The shock of 9/11 would mean rejoining the Navy. O\\'Shea had no illusions about what would lie ahead: \"Everyone felt like this was the mission that had to be done,\" he said. At Columbia University, Loren Crowe was taking his seat in a freshman calculus class when the first plane made impact just seven miles to the south. The attacks galvanized his resolve to join the U.S. Army. He eventually endured two deployments in Afghanistan as an infantry officer. \"My entire adult life has been spent in the shadow of the Twin Towers falling,\" Crowe told ABC News recently. \"I gave up my time, my youth, my health.\" For Dave Sharrett, an English teacher in Northern Virginia, the 9/11 attacks provoked a different reaction -- one of deep dread when his son, a tenacious teenage football standout who bore his own name, David H. Sharrett II, would follow his deep desire to serve America by joining the military. \"I would be thinking at that time, \\'The worst thing that could ever happen to me would be if my child was taken from me,\\'\" Sharrett recalled. The 9/11 attacks altered the fate of all three -- Crowe, O\\'Shea, and Sharrett -- and hundreds of thousands of others who joined the protracted fights. As those who served reflect on the past two decades and grapple with the unfathomable costs of life, many wonder what the U.S. got in return. It\\'s a question that has returned to the forefront in recent days as America\\'s engagement in Afghanistan came to a close, amid chaos and a return to power for the Taliban regime that 20 years ago had given safe harbor to Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda terrorists who attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. \"We really do have to take the time to think, what exactly is our mission? What exactly are we trying to accomplish? I don\\'t think much thought was given to any of those basic principles,\" said Leon Panetta, the former defense secretary and CIA director who inherited the first years of troubled invasions in Afghanistan and Iraq. \"Rather than achieving the kind of victory that I think everybody thought would happen, it blew up on all of us.\" Within weeks of the 9/11 terror attacks, with the Pentagon still smoldering, American leaders plotted steps to hold those responsible to account. But who to fight? Where to start? The immediate goal of the Bush administration was twofold: to seek justice for 9/11 and to secure the homeland. The decision to begin a combat offensive in Afghanistan first \"was not just retaliation,\" said John Bellinger, a former National Security Council chief lawyer in the Bush White House, \"but to prevent more attacks.\" The mission proved successful -- at the start. Within weeks of its invasion, American special operations forces -- including Green Berets who galloped down on horseback from the north -- had dismantled Taliban leadership in Kabul. The Islamist militant group had established power in Afghanistan toward the end of the 1990s and forged close bonds with al- Qaeda and its leader, who was obsessed with forcing the United States out of Muslim lands. Complicating matters was the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq on March 19, 2003. With the Afghanistan mission plowing ahead in 2002, American leaders publicly claimed that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was poised to obtain weapons of mass destruction -- and perhaps level a fresh round of attacks against the West. \"There was concern that Saddam Hussein was developing a relationship with al-Qaeda ... that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction and might consider sharing those with al-Qaeda,\" recalled Alberto Gonzales, White House counsel during Bush\\'s first term. \"And that was a deal breaker. That was a red line.\" After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Dan O\\'Shea thought the operation was going well. He sent a letter about the fall of Baghdad to a friend and said that the demise of Saddam Hussein was going to bring a brighter future to Iraqis. \"I said, \\'We have a long way to go with this, but, you know, we\\'re on our way to getting this job done right.\\' And I look back now, and I read that email, and I think, \\'Dan, you were naive on so many levels\\',\" he told ABC News. As deployments piled up for American servicemembers over the years, the distance between the forward operating base and the living room expanded. The initial victories in Baghdad and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power gave way to a protracted occupation -- an endless cycle of missions, fallen friends, and missed holidays at home. \"You judge your deployments by -- you\\'re missing what holidays. Are you missing Thanksgiving, Christmas, or are you missing Fourth of July? The ones that mean a lot to veterans, especially, Veterans Day and Memorial Day, of course,\" said O\\'Shea, who led hostage recovery efforts in Iraq and later was a counterinsurgency adviser in Afghanistan. Yet O\\'Shea said that often, while home, he couldn\\'t bring himself to attend holiday events with friends and family -- instead opting to spend them alone on the couch. Meanwhile, the initial rationale for the Iraq invasion quickly fell apart. The fall of Baghdad had happened swiftly. But the CIA-led search for Saddam Hussein\\'s elusive weapons of mass destruction came up empty, as did the alleged relationship his regime had with al-Qaeda, years of investigation later found. Under interrogation by the FBI in 2004, the captured dictator said his posturing before the U.S. invasion was to convince Iran -- not America -- that he had WMDs so that they would not realize how weak Iraq was militarily. The two neighboring countries had fought a war from 1980-1988. \"There was not good intelligence,\" said Card, Bush\\'s chief of staff. \"One of the things we learned going into Iraq is that we did not have good intelligence.\" The Bush White House faced accusations of misleading the public about the weapons of mass destruction. A 2008 Senate Intelligence Committee report concluded that Bush administration officials who sought to link the Iraqi government to al-Qaeda were \"not substantiated by the intelligence.\" Bush himself later conceded that he \"had a sickening feeling every time I thought about\" the failure to find weapons of mass destruction. \"No one was more shocked and angry than I was when we didn\\'t find the weapons,\" he wrote in his memoir, \"Decision Points.\" Critics said that in addition to not being guided by intelligence, the administration made misplaced foreign policy assumptions about Iraq -- and the consequences were immense. Invading Iraq redirected resources such as U.S. Army Special Forces teams from Afghanistan, before al-Qaeda and the Taliban had been fully neutralized and Osama bin Laden had been killed. \"Starting a whole new war in Iraq at a time that we were preoccupied in Afghanistan ... I do think it resulted in stretching ourselves too thin and taking our eye off the ball,\" said Bellinger. Furthermore, missteps by the U.S. military began to undermine its sympathetic image on the world stage. In 2004, revelations of torture and sadism at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq prompted shock and anger both domestically and abroad. Images showing U.S. servicemembers abusing and humiliating Iraqis incarcerated at the prison sparked scandal. \"When those photographs came out from the prison, that was an absolute earthquake of an event,\" said Martha Raddatz, ABC News\\' chief global affairs correspondent. \"It changed things. It changed the world\\'s opinion of what the American military was doing there and how they were treating Iraqis.\" \"When Abu Ghraib happened, I was shocked and embarrassed and mortified,\" said Card. As American troops failed to find weapons of mass destruction -- leaving the Bush administration\\'s predicate for war to slip away -- an al-Qaeda-led insurgency set in, inflicting a climbing rate of U.S. casualties by the summer of 2003, followed by mass-casualty bombings as the country descended into sectarian warfare. Back in Afghanistan, American forces got bogged down building short-lived relationships with local tribal leaders, providing security for U.S.-led farming projects and the digging of wells -- all in an effort to win so-called hearts and minds. The allied mission taken over by NATO skidded as efforts to confront Taliban strongholds in outlying regions garnered few results -- and prompted substantial American casualties -- as the military pushed further and further out from the capital of Kabul. Mission drift set in by 2010, when President Barack Obama\\'s troop surge yielded few tangible results. Crowe remembered receiving orders at the time to just \"hold on.\" \"If I had any high-minded ideals about joining the Army or, you know, fighting for country and democracy, I had given that up probably before we even hit country,\" Crowe said. Looking back at his deployments in the Pech Valley, far from the dusty streets of Kandahar where al-Qaeda plotted the 9/11 attacks, Crowe struggles to identify a rationale for the missions he led there -- an opinion shared by countless other \"Joes\" who would talk about combat \"down-range and outside the wire.\" \"Nobody should have died there. Nobody needed to die there. I don\\'t think I ever saw a greater strategic purpose for being there,\" Crowe said. \"\\'Hold on\\' is not a reason to send people across the world to take gunfire.\" Many others never came back: More than 8,500 U.S. and NATO service members died in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting the War on Terror. Among many of those who survived, the total collapse of Afghanistan\\'s government and its defeat by the Taliban last month -- with televised scenes of the helicopter evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul mirroring the 1975 evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, Vietnam -- have reinforced a sense of anger and confusion. \"The troops who fought the \\'forever wars\\' have grappled with questions over what it was all for -- even more so as they watched the pictures of Afghanistan\\'s fall almost 20 years after the 9/11 attacks that started the wars,\" said James Gordon Meek, an ABC News reporter who, as a newspaper correspondent, was embedded with U.S. and Afghan special operations forces during deployments. \"Combat veterans are trying to \\'pick up the pieces,\\' as one said, to heal their wounds, both visible and invisible, having spent their youth and spilled their blood in the mountains and the poppy fields, city streets and desert sands,\" Meek said. Others say they will never be whole after losing a loved one in wars they struggle to comprehend. High school English teacher Dave Sharrett raised three sons with his wife Vicki, and was preparing to retire after 30 years on the job. On January 16, 2008, he was teaching Shakespeare\\'s Othello -- a discussion of \"the great contention of the sea and skies\" -- when he got an urgent call from the school\\'s main office. His oldest son, at age 26, had joined the U.S. Army and volunteered for air assault training, and was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division which deployed to Iraq in late 2007. A family friend waiting for him in the office delivered the news -- Pfc. David Hastings Sharrett II had been killed in action near Balad, Iraq. That night Sharrett emailed Meek, the reporter and one of his former students: \"Oh my friend. Dave was killed while on patrol today. My god.\" Soon after, soldiers from Sharrett\\'s son\\'s platoon said there had been a cover-up. For four years, Sharrett and Meek teamed up to investigate the incident. \"Cover-ups in the military are rarely exposed,\" Meek said. \"Finding accountability is even rarer because the truth often gets buried with the dead.\" Their efforts ultimately led to three Army investigations, which concluded that during a gunfight with al-Qaeda insurgents, Pfc. Sharrett was shot and left for dead -- not by the enemy, but by his own lieutenant, who then left aboard a helicopter. The commander, who claimed not to remember the incident, was later promoted. \"What did the Army do?\" Sharrett asked. \"The Army decided, in its infinite wisdom, to give this guy a pass and to cover this up and protect everybody in the chain of command.\" A drone video later showed that Sharrett survived an initial ambush by a group of insurgents. But as he fled the gunfight -- shooting down one insurgent and taking fire from others -- he was shot by the officer, then fell to the ground within an arm\\'s reach. The officer then boarded a helicopter headed for a combat hospital. \"His lieutenant ... shoots him point-blank, fakes an injury, gets on a helicopter, flies away, leaves Dave lying on the battlefield wounded, where he proceeds to bleed for 90 minutes,\" Sharrett said. Only after news reports emerged detailing Pfc. Sharrett\\'s death and the cover-up did the Army remove the officer from active-duty service. The Army also revoked his service award -- a coveted Combat Infantry Badge. \"They left me behind, absolutely, and his brothers behind,\" Sharrett said. For Americans back home, the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011 marked a turning point in the wars -- a much-needed justification for the blood spilled and the resources squandered. But for the men and women waging war, the turning point ended up meaning little. \"It was one of the more bizarre days of my life when absolutely nothing changed,\" Crowe said. \"The deployment went on as scheduled.\" In mid-August of this year, as Loren Crowe watched Taliban insurgents re-take Kabul, years of pent-up frustration set in. \"Twenty years of war,\" he said. \"A little over a month after the U.S. pulls out of Afghanistan, and we are right back where we started 20 years ago. Everyone should have seen this coming.\" Dave Sharrett still struggles to answer one simple question: What did his son die for? \"The conclusion about going over there is, what a waste of a life,\" Sharrett said this week. \"I\\'m just being honest.\" \"If I was sitting in front of a bunch of politicians who were contemplating doing, this I\\'d say, \\'Let me tell you my story. Don\\'t let this ever f***ing happen again.\\' And I think I\\'d leave the \\'f***ing\\' in there for emphasis. And I mean that,\" he said.

As Louisiana residents began to survey the damage left by Hurricane Ida, they saw something they did not expect: a bottlenose dolphin in the middle of a residential retention pond. Authorities and wildlife officials near Slidell, Louisiana, began receiving reports of dolphin sightings after the heavy winds and torrential rain finally passed on Aug. 30, the day after the dangerous Category 4 hurricane made landfall in the state, sending storm surge over a foot tall from the Gulf of Mexico to nearby communities. Residents, dealing with no power or available gasoline for miles, were watching the dolphin pop in and out of the pond\\'s surface, Jon Peterson, vice president of SeaWorld Orlando\\'s zoological operations, told ABC News. The dolphin, a male juvenile, likely came in through Lake Pontchartrain, an estuary in Louisiana connected to the Gulf of Mexico, and was pushed by the hurricane into a canal that led to the retention pond, Moby Solangi, director of the Institute for Marine Mammals Studies in Gulfport, Mississippi, told ABC News. Once the storm surge began to recede, the dolphin became stuck in the pond, Solangi said. The pond, which is typically only 4 to 6 feet deep, is located in a residential area on a busy road, so the public had a clear view of the dolphin, Peterson said. Biologists were worried about the lack of salinity, dirty water due to lack of a filtration cycle, 90-degree water, which is much warmer than the dolphins are used to in open seas, and other contaminants that could pose a risk to the dolphin\\'s health, Peterson said. Several agencies, which also included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service, the Audubon Nature Institute and several local authorities, planned the extraction for days. It was initially scheduled for Tuesday but was moved up once biologists started noticing lesions on the dolphin\\'s skin, caused by the freshwater. \"And then those lesions become the entry point for viruses, bacteria,\" Solangi said. Once the rescuers were able to get to the scene, they studied the dolphin to see whether he liked to stay in a certain area, Peterson said. Typically, dolphins prefer the deepest waters, so the crews had to lure it away from that area to increase their visibility of the animal, he added. On Sunday, the rescuers were able to deploy a series of nets from a kayak to trap the dolphin, more than six days after it was trapped in the pond, Peterson said. The dolphin was then examined by a team of veterinarians, tagged and placed in a transport truck before it was released into the Gulf of Mexico. Based on the dolphin\\'s length, nearly 6 feet, it is likely still so young that it is still dependent on its mother and was part of a pod, Solangi said. It is unclear if the dolphin ate while it was in the pond, and the next step will be to track the dolphin to see if it is able to reunite with its group, he added. Other than the freshwater lesions, the dolphin seemed to be in decent physical shape, Peterson said. While it is typical for wildlife to become displaced after large storms, the rescues tend to occur in rural areas, Peterson said. This event occurred in a suburban city and was met with fanfare, with up to 100 bystanders surrounding the pond, applauding as rescuers completed their efforts, Peterson said. Peterson reminded the public to never try to handle wildlife themselves, even if they think they are being helpful. \"The rule of thumb is watch from a distance,\" he said. \"If you\\'re not sure if it needs help, call the right people, and they\\'ll assist you and let you know.\"\\nA Florida man fed up with repeated potholes near his place of business has planted a banana tree in one of them to warn motorists away FORT MYERS, Fla. -- A man fed up with a private road in poor condition near his southwest Florida business has a novel solution: plant a banana tree in a pothole to warn motorists away. Last week, Bryan Raymond planted the tree in a stubborn pothole along Honda Drive just off U.S. 41 in south Fort Myers. Raymond, who owns Progress and Pride Fitness Group, said the idea of planting a banana tree ripened in his mind after having to fill holes in the street with cement multiple times. Because Honda Drive is a private street, county officials said, its up to the business owners to maintain the street. For Raymond, the banana tree is an attention-grabbing repair. \"If we have to maintain it and make sure nobody gets hurt, we are going to put something obvious there to make sure nobody gets in the hole,\" Raymond told television station WBBH. For some time, Raymond\\'s security cameras have caputured problems along the street, including a pothole damaging cars and floodwaters causing his trash bin to float away. Some who work along the road say anything is better than potholes. \"I love it, I think its hilarious. We should have more of these,\" said Scott Shein, who works at a nearby business, told WBBH. \"I think it is sending a message.\" He\\'s seen so many cars hit a pothole on the street and \"bottom out\" that it\\'s a real concern. Charlie Lopez, who lives in nearby Cape Coral, agrees. \"It messes up your tire, messes up the rim and then it basically messes up your day,\" he said. For some, though, the sight of a tree brings disbelief. \"I pulled up and Im like, is that really a tree in the middle of the road?\" said John Hulker, who lives in Fort Myers, speaking with WINK-TV.\\nA federal appeals court has affirmed the conviction of one of ex-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\\'s top aides for fraud and accepting bribes NEW YORK -- The conviction of one of ex-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomos top aides for fraud and accepting bribes was affirmed by a federal appeals court Wednesday. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the case against Joseph Percoco required it to again consider the reach of federal fraud and bribery laws. Percoco, 52, was a longtime friend and top aide to Cuomo, a Democrat who recently resigned as governor amid sexual harassment allegations. The appeals court also upheld the conviction of Steven Aiello, 63, a Syracuse real estate executive who was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in funneling bribes to Percoco to gain his influence in an ambitious Buffalo Billion development project aimed at encouraging economic development upstate. Percoco, convicted of accepting over $300,000 from companies seeking to influence the Cuomo administration, was sentenced to six years in prison. He is scheduled to be released in April 2024. The scandal was a multi-year black cloud over the Cuomo administration and was frequently cited by critics as proof that Cuomo failed to address chronic corruption in state government, even within his own administration. In a decision written by 2nd Circuit Judge Richard J. Sullivan, a three-judge appeals panel rejected arguments that a jury at a 2018 trial was improperly instructed on the law by a judge who improperly concluded there was sufficient evidence for convictions. The 2nd Circuit said it was successfully proven that Percoco accepted bribes and promised to perform official actions to further the interests of an energy company, Competitive Power Venture. And it said prosecutors had proven that Percoco, in a second scheme, agreed with Aiello to advance the interests of Aiello\\'s real estate development company, COR Development Co. The appeals court agreed with lawyers for Percoco and Aiello that a judge\\'s bribery instructions to the jury fell short of the legal standard that was recently clarified in another New York state corruption case, but it said the error was harmless and the jury would have convicted anyway. Prosecutors declined through a spokesperson to comment. Messages seeking comment were sent to lawyers for Percoco and Aiello, who has not yet reported to prison. Trial evidence overwhelmingly showed that Percoco and his co-conspirators understood that payments to Percoco\\'s wife for a low-show job as an \"education consultant\" were in exchange for his help in getting energy company CPV a deal requiring New York state to purchase power from the company, the 2nd Circuit said. In an amusing moment at trial, the payments were described in coded communications between the co-conspirators in 2012 as \"ziti,\" a reference to how payoffs were described by characters on the award-winning HBO series \"The Sopranos.\" The COR Development scheme developed while Percoco was temporarily managing Cuomo\\'s reelection campaign in 2014. The 2nd Circuit said evidence showed Aiello arranged for his company to pay Percoco to take actions to benefit the company. Prior to leading Cuomo\\'s reelection campaign, Percoco was executive deputy secretary to the governor, a position that gave him power over Cuomo\\'s budget, personnel decisions and operations and a significant role in overseeing labor relations, government affairs and legislative affairs, the appeals court noted. \"Percocos power was amplified by his unique relationship with Governor Cuomo; he had worked with Governor Cuomo in a number of roles, and was known for being close to him and his family,\" the 2nd Circuit said.\\nThe FBI on Wednesday released new video from its investigation into the still-unidentified suspect who allegedly planted pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee the night before a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The video, which includes a virtual map showing the route the suspect walked around the Capitol Hill neighborhood on the night of Jan. 5, shows the suspect pacing with a backpack in front of a row of houses. At one point the suspect sets the bag down and is passed by an individual walking their dog. Another video shows the suspect sitting down on a bench outside the front of the DNC. More than eight months after the report of the two pipe bombs sent law enforcement stationed around the Capitol scrambling to create perimeters around the RNC and DNC, investigators have continued combing through videos and seeking tips on the masked suspect seen wearing a grey sweatshirt with Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers. In late January, the bureau announced it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the capture of the suspect, who planted what investigators described as \"viable\" explosive devices next to a bench in front of the DNC and then in an alley near the RNC. According to the FBI, the components of the devices included 1/8-inch threaded galvanized pipes, a kitchen timer and homemade black gun powder. In March, the FBI released additional surveillance videos showing the suspected bomber walking with a backpack and planting the devices between 7:40 and 8:15 p.m. But it\\'s still unclear whether the stream of videos and public releases in recent months has yielded any substantial progress in tracking down the suspect. FBI bulletins on the suspect do not specify whether investigators have determined if the pipe bomber is male, female or has any other personally identifiable characteristics. In contrast, the FBI\\'s sweeping investigation into the rioters who stormed the Capitol and clashed with law enforcement has resulted in the arrests of more than 600 individuals, according to an analysis of public court documents by ABC News. The bureau has said it is still seeking tips on over 200 more who are believed to have committed violent acts at the Capitol.\\nBut he did say at least 100 U.S. citizens may still want to leave. There are a \"small number\" of U.S. citizens in the northern Afghan city Mazar-e-Sharif who have been unable to evacuate on chartered flights, Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed Tuesday, but he said the Taliban had grounded the aircraft because others manifested for these flights did not have valid travel documents. The chartered flights for approximately 600 people have been held at Mazar-e-Sharif\\'s airport for over a week now, according to sources who helped organize them, with at least 19 U.S. citizens waiting in the city to board and flee Afghanistan. A top Republican lawmaker said Sunday these Americans and at-risk Afghans were essentially being held hostage by the Taliban - something that Blinken dismissed Tuesday. The Taliban have publicly said they will allow safe passage for those who want to leave, but without international flights yet and with overland journeys dangerous, it\\'s been intensely difficult for those that were left behind by President Joe Biden\\'s evacuation operations. Among them are at least 100 U.S. citizens, Blinken said Tuesday, adding that the State Department has been \"in direct contact with virtually all of them. We have case-management teams assigned to them to make sure that those who want to leave can in fact do so.\" Four of those Americans were able to evacuate over land to a neighboring country, a senior State Department official confirmed to ABC News Monday, saying the department helped facilitate their travel. The Taliban were aware and did not impede their transit, the official added. They declined to say which country the family of four arrived in, but said local U.S. embassy officials met them at the border and said they were in \"good condition.\" Hours later, however, Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, who served as former President Donald Trump\\'s White House doctor, accused the State Department of \"lying,\" saying the agency \"didn\\'t do a damn thing for these people for 12 days except almost get them killed repeatedly.\" \"This is an attempt to save face by the administration for the Americans they left behind. This is a woman with three children from age 15 all the way down to two-years-old, and they did nothing to try to expedite this,\" Cory Mills, a U.S. Army veteran and Trump appointee at the Pentagon, told Fox News. \"It\\'s like we carried the ball to the 99-and-a-half yard line, and them taking it that last half yard and being like, \\'Look what we did.\\'\" The State Department declined to comment in response. But Blinken said Tuesday the agency has been \"working around the clock with NGOs, with members of Congress, and advocacy groups\" and \"conducting a great deal of diplomacy on this,\" including with Taliban leaders. That includes with the NGO Ascend, a Washington-based nonprofit dedicated to empowering women and girls through mountain climbing. Its CEO Marina LeGree told ABC News Sunday that its Afghan members are \"among hundreds of individuals -- including some American citizens -- who have been blocked by the Taliban from leaving Mazar-e-Sharif by charter plane for six days\" at that point -- now going on eight. Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, went further, telling Fox News Sunday that the Taliban had created a \"hostage situation where they\\'re not going to allow American citizens to leave until they get full recognition from the United States of America.\" Blinken confirmed the State Department had identified \"a relatively small number of Americans\" in Mazar-e-Sharif with families trying to evacuate, but he denied there was \"any hostage-like situation\" or anyone held on aircraft or at the airport. \"It\\'s my understanding that the Taliban has not denied exit to anyone holding a valid document, but they have said that those without valid documents at this point can\\'t leave - but because all of these people are grouped together, that\\'s meant that flights have not been allowed to go,\" he added. Some critics have rejected that, saying the Biden administration must do more to get these flights off the ground and help these U.S. citizens and vulnerable Afghans. But Blinken said while they\\'re \"doing all we can to clear any roadblocks... to make sure that charter flights carrying Americans or others to whom we have a special responsibility can depart Afghanistan safely,\" the U.S. has limited ability to help. \"Without personnel on the ground, we can\\'t verify the accuracy of manifests, the identities of passengers, flight plans, or aviation security protocols, so this is a challenge, but one we are determined to work through,\" he said Tuesday in Qatar, visiting with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to thank the Qatari government for its help hosting tens of thousands of evacuees. Qatari teams have flown into Kabul late last week to make repairs at the international airport and negotiate with the Taliban to reopen it securely. Speaking alongside Blinken and Austin, Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told reporters the airport had resumed chartered flights for aid groups and United Nations officials, including the top U.N. aid official Martin Griffiths who visited and met with Taliban leaders Sunday. \"We are about to get everything operational very soon,\" Al Thani added, saying negotiations were ongoing with the Taliban to ensure the airport\\'s management and security -- less than two weeks after ISIS-K, the terror group\\'s branch in Afghanistan, said it attacked a gate and killed at least 182 people, including 13 U.S. service members. Editor\\'s note: This article has been updated with the correct spelling of Cory Mills\\' name.\\nThe White House is asking Congress to approve an additional $24 billion in spending to handle the costs of Hurricane Ida and other natural disasters The White House is asking Congress to approve an additional $24 billion in spending to handle the costs of Hurricane Ida and other natural disasters, as well as $6.4 billion for the resettlement of evacuees from Afghanistan to help with transportation, government processing and public health screenings. Shalanda Young, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, in a blog post Tuesday proposed the spending be part of a stopgap spending bill, saying \"its clear\" that Congress will need more time to pass a full 2022 budget. Continuing resolutions typically are approved by Congress to keep the government operating when the annual appropriations/spending bills have not been approved before the fiscal year ends at the end of September. \"The purpose of this guidance is to advise lawmakers on how to avoid severe disruptions to public services that could inadvertently arise from extending the previous years appropriations legislation without modifications,\" Young wrote. Congress is weighing plans that could increase federal spending by $3.5 trillion over 10 years, some of which would be offset by tax increases on the wealthy and corporations. But the annual appropriations bills are separate, and provide the funding needed to keep the government running past Sept. 30 and avert a federal shutdown. Congress faces a few short weeks as it races to address both issues. President Joe Biden will need to keep Democratic lawmakers united to get that $3.5 trillion social, climate change and environment measure passed, as Republicans have vowed to block it. There is, separately, $550 billion in new infrastructure spending that the Senate approved on a bipartisan basis. The OMB is also recommending additional money for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and renewing authorities for the Bureau of Reclamation so that it can respond to droughts. Youngs blog post notes that more than $14 billion was needed to address natural disasters before Ida ravaged Louisiana, Mississippi and communities along the eastern seaboard as it traveled north. She estimates that another $10 billion will be needed to specifically address Ida, including funds for community development block grants, emergency highway relief and Small Business Administration disaster loans, among other programs. The sum for Ida-related expenses is rough as much of the damage is still being assessed. The federal government is on track to have spent $6.8 trillion during fiscal 2021, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Much of that spending reflects the relief such as direct payments and expanded jobless aid that were provided in response to the coronavirus pandemic that put the yearly budget deficit at $3 trillion. Biden initially proposed a $6 trillion budget for 2022 as COVID-19 aid waned with a deficit of $1.8 trillion.\\nThe president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ advocacy group in the U.S., was terminated Monday night for allegedly helping former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in his response to sexual harassment allegations. Alphonso David, a former lawyer for Cuomo, was voted out by the Human Rights Campaign and its foundation boards of directors \"for cause, effective immediately, for violations of his contract.\" The Aug.3 New York Attorney General report, which alleged Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women, alleged David sent files relating to accuser Lindsey Boylans employment history to Cuomo staff at the request of Cuomo\\'s then-secretary Melissa DeRosa in December 2020. The files were later shared with several journalists after Boylan tweeted that the Governor had sexually harassed her, the report said. David, who worked as chief counsel to the governor from April 2015 until becoming president of the HRC in August 2019, was not working for the Cuomo administration at the time he sent the files. Further, the report stated that the governor and a group of advisors worked on a draft letter in response to Boylans sexual harassment allegations. David reportedly received a draft of that letter. When the governor suggested to put signatures on the letter, \"Mr. David testified that he told Ms. DeRosa that he was not signing the letter but was willing to reach out to others to see if they would sign it,\" the AG report stated. HRC and its boards of directors announced an investigation into his actions related to the AG report last month. \"As outlined in the New York Attorney General report, Mr. David engaged in a number of activities in December 2020, while HRC President, to assist Governor Cuomos team in responding to allegations by Ms. Boylan of sexual harassment,\" Morgan Cox and Jodie Patterson, Human Rights Campaign and Foundation Board Chairs, said in a statement. \"This conduct in assisting Governor Cuomos team, while president of HRC, was in violation of HRCs Conflict of Interest policy and the mission of HRC,\" they added. After news of his firing, David shared a statement on social media stating, \"Expect a legal challenge.\" \"After I demanded truth and transparency, the HRC board co-chairs who should stand for human rights elected to hide in darkness. They unjustly provided notice of termination to me in order to end my fight for the integrity of the review process and for what is right. I asked for the report, they refused. They lied about producing the report,\" he said. \"As a Black, gay man who has spent his whole life fighting for civil and human rights, they cannot shut me up,\" he added. In a statement shared on his social media Sunday he said, \"I was shocked and sick to my stomach and immediately called on Governor Cuomo to resign,\" adding \"I was also the one who called for HRC to conduct an independent review, and I participated in it fully.\" Joni Madison, the current chief operating officer and chief staff of the HRC will serve as interim president as the board search for a replacement. His exit is the latest fallout from the report that also led Roberta A. Kaplan, the co-founder of the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, which fights for sexual harassment victims, to resign after the report named Kaplan as allegedly being involved in an effort to discredit one of Cuomo\\'s accusers. She resigned despite contesting the claim that she counseled Cuomo in responding to an accuser. DeRosa, one of Cuomo\\'s top aides, also resigned last month after state investigators alleged she was part of the \"retaliation\" against one of his accusers. Cuomo resigned last month after the damning report and amid a mounting chorus of calls for him to step down. He has consistently denied all allegations of sexual harassment.\\nTrump isnt on the ballot this fall, but some Democrats are acting like he is. The TAKE with Rick Klein It\\'s not just Republicans depending on former President Donald Trump for messaging and motivation. While Trump, of course, isn\\'t on the ballot this fall, the Democrats in the most closely contested statewide races of 2021 are acting as if he basically is. In Virginia, where early voting in the governor\\'s race starts next week, former and would-be-future Gov. Terry McAuliffe is portraying his Republican opponent as something of a Trump clone. A sampling of recent campaign fundraising appeals warns of \"Trump\\'s comeback,\" and asserts that Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin would \"do to Virginia what Donald Trump did to our country.\" In California, where voting in the recall election concludes one week from Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom has been singling out the best-polling Republican vying to replace him, conservative talk-show host Larry Elder. \"They found someone, remarkably, that\\'s actually to the right of Donald Trump -- actually wants to go further in many respects than Donald Trump,\" Newsom told ABC\\'s Zohreen Shah over the weekend. Democrats\\' messaging has crystallized in the wake of the Supreme Court\\'s decision to let stand, at least for now, the Texas anti-abortion law. All three Trump-appointed justices voted as part of the 5-4 majority to allow the law to go into effect. Both McAuliffe and Newsom are running in states with sizable though by no means overwhelming numbers of Trump voters. President Joe Biden won Virginia by 10 points last year, and carried California by 29. It would be shocking if either McAuliffe or Newsom win by margins even close to that large, and there are reasons both anecdotal and historical to think Democrats are right to be worried about the races. Yet whether or not they\\'re trying to do it, the races will test the endurance and energy of the Trump base. That\\'s been dangerous territory for Democrats over the past few years. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper On Labor Day, the Department of Justice announced it will enforce protections for people seeking and providing reproductive health care services. It comes as the agency crafts a strategy to challenge Texas\\' restrictive abortion law. Attorney General Merrick Garland pointed to the FACE Act, which prohibits the obstruction of patients and providers of reproductive health services, including abortion care. \"The department has consistently obtained criminal and civil remedies for violations of the FACE Act since it was signed into law in 1994, and it will continue to do so now,\" wrote Garland. The White House has also pledged to look for ways to combat the effects of SB8, though Biden\\'s Chief of Staff Ron Klain didn\\'t have many details when asked Sunday on CNN. \"We are going to find ways, if they\\'re at all possible, and I think they are possible, we are going to find ways to make a difference for the women of Texas to try to protect their constitutional rights, yes,\" Klain said. Amid public outcry from abortion rights groups, abortion providers and Democratic groups, there are also concerns that other states could attempt to replicate the Texas law. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema As the midterm primary season begins to take shape post Labor Day, the potential contours of the 2024 Republican presidential primary are also appearing to fall into place, with GOP governors\\' handling of the pandemic coming to the forefront of the possible outlook. In an interview on NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press\" over the weekend, Maryland\\'s two-term Gov. Larry Hogan -- one of a handful of Republican executives leading blue states -- criticized the COVID-related messaging coming from the White House. \"I was fairly critical of President Trump when I thought that they were bad on messaging, when I thought they were doing things wrong and not providing the assistance that we needed in the states, and I\\'ve been (doing) the same thing with the Biden administration,\" Hogan said. \"We\\'re getting some mixed messaging out of the administration, out of the CDC, the FDA and the White House, and we need clear guidance on these booster shots because it undermines the credibility of it,\" the term-limited governor added. As a cancer survivor, Hogan received his third vaccine dose in late August. Hogan\\'s criticism of leaders from both parties stands in sharp contrast to the Trump-aligned actions of other potential 2024 hopefuls like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida\\'s Gov. Ron DeSantis. With more than 80% of eligible Maryland residents having received at least one vaccine dose, the move could also allow Hogan to distance himself from being pulled into a possible politically negative pandemic narrative.

The men, who have been identified as Shawn Sommers, Raymond Witkowski and David Pfindel, are suspected of having varying roles in the creation of the fraudulent cards. Sommers and Witkowski resigned their posts on Aug. 10, one day after another trooper raised concerns with supervisors about their conduct, police said. Pfindel resigned on Sept. 3, following an investigation by the Department of Public Safety. \"The accusations in this case involve an extraordinary level of misconduct -- a criminal violation of the law -- and I could not be more upset and disappointed,\" Col. Matthew T. Birmingham, director of the Vermont State Police, said. \"If these allegations are proved to be true, it is reprehensible that state troopers would manipulate vaccination cards in the midst of a pandemic, when being vaccinated is one of the most important steps anyone can take to keep their community safe from COVID-19.\" As soon as state police supervisors found out about the former troopers\\' alleged actions, they said they immediately reported the allegations to federal law enforcement. \"I\\'m embarrassed that this situation has occurred and know that it has tarnished the reputation of the Vermont State Police,\" Birmingham continued. \"That said, the alleged criminal conduct from these troopers does not represent the values and actions of the dedicated men and women of the Vermont State Police.\" In August, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott announced that some state employees who work with vulnerable people would be required to get vaccinated, but it is unclear if the State Police are in that category. The state police have referred the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in Burlington. An investigation by the FBI is underway, and as a result, police were unable to release information about the incident prior to Tuesday\\'s statement. \"Sommers and Witkowski both joined the Vermont State Police in July 2016 and were assigned to field stations following their graduation from the Vermont Police Academy in January 2017,\" police said in their statement. \"Pfindel was hired in January 2014 and assigned to the St. Albans Barracks. He transferred to Shaftsbury in February 2016, became a detective trooper with the Bureau of Criminal Investigations in July 2016, and returned to work as a road trooper in April 2020.\"\\nThis morning on Good Morning America, co-anchor Robin Roberts and contributor Lara Spencer joined Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse at Disney California Adventure park to welcome the cast of the 30th season of ABCs \"Dancing with the Stars.\" The show returns to ABC on September 20, at 8 p.m. Eastern and Pacific times.

See Peyton \"hang loose\" in \"Doogie Kamealoha M.D.,\" now streaming on Disney+!\\nA chill went down Graphic Designer Tim Wollwebers spine when he realized two Roman numeral \"X\"s for the eyes of zombie gingerbread men would perfectly \"skelebrate\" 20 seasons of Haunted Mansion Holiday and its creepy centerpiece, the Gingerbread House in the mansions ballroom, debuted to guests September 3. \"Its so fitting, isnt it?\" Tim chuckled. \"I love to think about all the double Xs were placing everywhere. In fact, were calling the house \\'EXXhumed Delight, since we basically dug up references to the past 19 years of gingerbread houses to create this one.\" Dead-icated fans of the attraction, which pays tribute to \"Tim Burtons The Nightmare Before Christmas\" every Halloween Time through holiday season, will no doubt devour the details in this years gingerbread house and its nods to past years. Its easy to spot 2009s Scary-Go-Round House, 2015s Gingerbread Card House, 2014s Gingerbread Zombie House and Tims personal favorite, the Giant Man-eating Wreath House from 2005, but other creepy contributions are more, uh, subtle. \"Looking at it from the point of view of Jack [Skellington], it felt like we should go down to our gingerbread graveyard and dig up all the pieces we love,\" Tim said. \"And we wound up putting together this really fun, bright, obnoxious memorial to 20 years.\" After designing the house on paper and then creating a computer 3D model, Tims partners in Fabrication created the understructure, while the Entertainment Technical Services team worked on animated elements, like the independently moving (and treacherous) arms of the man-eating wreath and snake that keeps trying (and failing) to eat the gingerbread zombie. \"We use a combination of air pistons and rotary actuators that are controlled by electrically triggered valves,\" said Stage Technician Richard Miller. \"Its complicated -- and magical!\" The Central Bakery team spent hundreds of hours baking and decorating the nearly 13-foot house (the biggest ever!) in five main pieces, which were then carefully moved into the mansion, where they were assembled on the ballrooms dining table. Then, the team placed shingles and other finishing touches, \"like snow and maybe a couple of hidden Mickeys,\" said Pastry Sous Chef Gracie Gomez. Pastry Sous Chef Gracie Gomez and Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock work on some of the pieces of the gingerbread house in the Central Bakery. This year, the bakery used more than 200 pounds each of gingerbread dough and powdered sugar, about 50 pounds of egg whites and more than a pound of glitter to make the mini mansion spellbindingly sparkly. \"Every year the team works tirelessly to create this masterpiece, and we have people whove worked on it every year,\" Gracie said. \"My favorite part is getting on the attraction and seeing the house as a guest because we can see all the work that these cast members put in, in its finished glory.\" And in case anyone doesnt realize that Haunted Mansion Holiday is marking 20 years, Tim designed a reminder in the pumpkin patch in front of the mansion. \"Its a remembrance wreath on an easel, like the ones people would use to memorialize the dead,\" Tim said. In the middle is a tombstone-like representation of Jacks face with a nod to his 20 years at the mansion. \"Its both funereal and Christmas-y, which is exactly what Jack would want.\" The rendering and list below provide a ghoulish glimpse of which house from the past is represented in each element of of this years creation.\\nThe new Tenaya Stone Spa opens on September 16, 2021, at Disneys Grand Californian Hotel & Spa at Disneyland Resort - and were sharing another sneak peek! First, be sure to see our recent story on the Disney Parks Blog for an introduction to this all-new, one-of-a-kind retreat. Tenaya Stone Spa is a new 6,000 square-foot getaway designed by Disney Imagineers who gathered inspiration from the spirit of nature, indigenous cultures of California and the iconic Craftsman design of the hotel. This gorgeous spa was built with thoughtful details at every turn, so here to tell us more is Katrina Mosher, an art director at Walt Disney Imagineering, and Dawn Jackson, a Native American cultural advisor within Disney, who worked on the project as an Imagineer on the Story Development team. What does Tenaya mean? Dawn: Tenaya (pronounced ten-eye-uh) can be interpreted \\'to dream in the indigenous culture of the Yosemite Valley. How did you develop the design and story of this experience? Katrina: We wanted it to fit well within Disneys Grand Californian Hotel, melding in nature, the Craftsman experience and a California story. It also needed to be a modern day spa, with contemporary elements. Dawn: The story development for Tenaya Stone Spa was an amazing journey. We considered the story of the hotel, and in thinking about California, the indigenous people. Dawn, tell us about your work as a cultural advisor: Dawn: As a cultural advisor, I was able to connect with tribal elders to look at California heritage. Who were the ancestors? What materials did they use? What stones were important? What tools? We met with elders and took this journey together. It had to be authentic. I am a Saginaw Chippewa tribal member from Michigan, and wanted to increase my knowledge of specific tribal cultures of Yosemite. I met with different tribes and then focused on the Southern Sierra Miwok. I also thought about my own tribal teachings of what it means to live a well and balanced life. This combination of cultural knowledge comes together in Tenaya Stone Spa. Tell us about the Tenaya stone: Dawn: This Tenaya stone went on a journey. We were looking for it with a Miwok elder and her family, who are descendants of Chief Tenaya of the Ahwahnechee people. The stone revealed itself and this Miwok family blessed it and gifted it to us. This stone has been shaped and formed over eons of time on earth. It is the center and the heart of the spa - and a place to reflect and set intentions. What were your guiding principles in design elements? Katrina: Much of the Craftsman architecture has you look \"out and up,\" such as looking out across landscaping and up at the trees. In the spa, you literally do the opposite to look \"down and in.\" The translation of that into nature is going down into the earth, into stone and into roots. We took the cue from Mother Nature in order to inspire the design. Tell us about the \"powers of four\": Katrina: The spa design embraces the concept of the natural order of four, found throughout many indigenous cultures of the world. There are four directions, four colors, four elements and four points of wellness. These bring balance and harmony to the mind, body and spirit. Tenaya Stone Spa has a strong axis in the design that represents the powers of four. The tree root chandelier is eye-catching! Katrina: At the entrance in the spa is a tree root chandelier, because tree roots go down and into the earth and soak up water, which represents our water element. We used obsidian because it represents the color black, which is associated with the west, inside this exposed redwood tree root. It is surrounded by beautiful pendants that our artisans made out of stained glass, which look like gemstones hanging from the ceiling. The relaxation lounge is a special spot: Katrina: The relaxation lounge is on the east side, where the sun rises. Being a fire element and associated with the color yellow, the stained glass window represents beautiful sunrays coming into the room, incorporating sliced agate stone. A trickling water feature has a vein of gold running through the mineral rock. The carpet is designed from a photo I took near Tenaya Lake, the place where the Tenaya stone came from. Tell us about the artwork and the minerals: Katrina: On the south side, we have the color red and the air element, which is represented in an art piece made with red pumice and red obsidian. On the north side, we have the color white and the earth element, which is represented by a beautiful mural by a Native American artist. She creates her art out of things that she finds in her natural environment such as pine cones and acorns, and creates basket weave patterns. Also on the north side, we have white magnesite, which is a very precious stone and was once used as currency by some California tribes. Our particular white magnesite was sourced from a place called Chalk Mountain. The wood flooring! Tell us about that: Katrina: On the philosophy of looking \"down and in,\" we went down and into the wood flooring. Instead of wood planks, we cut wood rounds. You can literally see the life of the tree and what is inside of it. What do you want guests to come away with after visiting Tenaya Stone Spa? Dawn: I hope the guests will experience this idea of balance in their lives and recalibrating, perhaps, to rebalance or refocus. To live in balance means with your spiritual, emotional, physical and social self. When they leave, may they take the memory of Tenaya Stone home with them until their next visit. Tenaya Stone Spa features eight treatment rooms, two for couples massage, four manicure/pedicure chairs, a relaxation lounge, mens and womens changing rooms, and a retail boutique. Advance appointments are now available. The spa will initially be available for guests of the Hotels of the Disneyland Resort and will open to the public at a later date. For more information and a complete list of services, please visit Disneyland.com/TenayaStoneSpa. At this time, all spa guests are required to wear approved face coverings during their entire visit, regardless of vaccination status.

Natural elements are everywhere, from the wood rounds in the flooring and decor of agate and quartz crystals to a chandelier made of old tree roots hanging in the boutique. A closer look at the design details of the spa, opening Sept. 16 at Disneys Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, also reveals a deep appreciation and respect for the indigenous cultures of the region. Dawn Jackson, a Native American cultural advisor at Disney, began working on the project as an Imagineer on the Story Development team. Now an associate in Corporate Brand Management, Dawn played a significant role in bringing Tenaya Stone Spa to life and continues to serve as an internal cultural resource on projects at Disney that include Native American representation. Dawn could not have imagined the cultural advisor role she would eventually play at the company when she began working in creative development at Disney Stores in 1993. At the time, Disney was working on the film \"Pocahontas,\" and Dawns team was developing the product lines, referencing Great Plains tribal beadwork and Southwestern iconography. Dawn, a member of the Saginaw Chippewa Tribe, is from Michigan, and her tribe shares the same Algonquin language base as Pocahontas tribe, the Powhatan Tribe in Virginia. \"I remember thinking, \\'Im not sure we are representing the Native people of Virginia of that time period correctly in our product designs.\" Dawn did her own research and put together her own style boards for her leaders. \"I didnt even know if anyone would look at them, but I said, \\'this is my culture and this is what I know, and thats how it all started. That was 28 years ago, and it has just grown from there.\" Dawns role as a resource expanded to Native American community outreach nationwide while continuing to advise on Native American-related content and products at Disney, from movies and merchandise to games and now, a spa at the Disneyland Resort. In 2018, Katrina Mosher, an art director at Walt Disney Imagineering, connected with Dawns team while working on updates to Disneys Grand Californian Hotel & Spa; she wanted to incorporate a Native American-inspired storyline that guests would feel during their experience. As they worked together on the spa, Dawn and Katrina created a design philosophy inspired by tribal teachings on wellness and balance. \"In my tribe, a life well lived means it is in balance in four areas of ones life: social, spiritual, emotional and physical,\" explained Dawn. The theme of the natural order of four is represented throughout Tenaya Stone Spa: four main colors (white, red, black, yellow); four stones (white magnesite, red pumice, black obsidian, gold pyrite); four indigenous medicinal plants (sweet grass, sage, cedar, tobacco); and special signifiers to mark the four directional points of the spa: north, south, east and west. Dawn met with various tribal contacts and friends who introduced her to contacts in the Yosemite Valley, whom she later learned were direct descendants of Chief Tenaya of the Ahwahnechee Miwok people. These relationships provided Dawn and Katrina with a deeper appreciation of the tribes culture, which is reflected in the spas design and decor. For instance, white magnesite, previously used as a form of currency by some California tribes, represents \"earth\" -- one of the four main elements. The spas music, from a Native American singer, was selected to pay homage to indigenous musical stylings. In the center of the spa is the Tenaya Stone itself: a stone gifted from the descendants of Chief Tenaya. Dawn hopes that cast members and guests feel a connection to the spas storyline and is proud of her role in shaping its authenticity. \"No matter what the product is, I think we have a huge responsibility to tell stories thoughtfully and authentically because we have the ability to shape peoples perceptions of different cultures,\" Dawn said. \"In my Native community, one of the most respectful things you can say to someone is \\'you did it in a good way. It means you did it with a pure heart and the right intentions and approached it with respect. Thats the best compliment you can give, and I want Disney to continue to do things in a good way.\"\\nEach and every day, cast members across Walt Disney World put on their iconic nametags over their costumes -- and their hearts -- to mark the important role they play in making magic for our guests. Whether its on their first day or their 50th year, wearing a nametag is an incredibly meaningful tradition for all of us as cast members. These instantly recognizable identifiers were designed to create a welcoming environment where everyone knows one another by name and instill a sense of pride among cast members, uniting us all as a family of storytellers and magic-makers. With \"The Worlds Most Magical Celebration\" just weeks away, Walt Disney World cast members are honoring the decades-long tradition with new 50th-themed nametags featuring a dazzling EARidescent design. The shimmering gold accents, iridescent overlay and 50th anniversary logo perfectly represent the splendor of the 18-month celebration, and how our cast members are the heart of it all. From the moment we received our own first nametags as brand-new cast members in Traditions, weve known the magic that they hold. When we put them on for the very first time, we officially became part of the legacy of Walt Disney World Resort. Fast forward to today, when hundreds of new cast members are being surprised with their own first nametags in Traditions and instantly feeling the pride that comes with being a cast member, knowing they are now part of the magic that has fueled us for all these years. Now, every cast member at Walt Disney World Resort will get to feel that rush again, too, as the new nametags honoring our 50th anniversary are distributed throughout September. Our cast members are central to the magic we make, and we cant wait to share even more of that magic with you as we continue to celebrate this historic milestone.\\nNearly one year ago, Pixar Fest was introduced as an opportunity to celebrate the animation studio that has brought fans around the world together with some of the most iconic moments in filmmaking history.

The gray towers stood, both guarding and welcoming, at the gateway to the nation. Out of nowhere came the impact, the blaze, the smoke -- and then the towers were gone. When the dust and flames finally cleared, a new world had emerged. The death and destruction defined that late summer day and remain seared in the minds of those who lived through Sept. 11, 2001. From the ashes and wreckage rose a new America: a society redefined by its scars and marked by a new wartime reality -- a shadow darkened even more in recent days by the resurgence of fundamentalist Islamist rule in the far-off land that hatched the attacks. Twenty years later -- with more than 70 million Americans born since the crucible of the attacks -- the legacy of 9/11 remains. From airport security to civilian policing to the most casual parts of daily life, it would be nearly impossible to identify something that remains untouched and unaffected by those terrifying hours in 2001. This week, ABC News revisits the 9/11 attacks and unwinds their aftermath, taking a deep look at the America born in the wake of destruction. \"9/11 Twenty Years Later: The Longest Shadow\" is a five-part documentary series narrated by George Stephanopoulos. Episodes will air on ABC News Live each night leading up to the 20th anniversary of the attacks, from Sept. 6-10. The series will be rebroadcast in full following the commemoration ceremonies on Saturday, Sept. 11. Part 4: No trial, no conviction, no release When police arrived at Lakhdar Boumediene\\'s office in Bosnia in late 2001, Boumediene says that \"they promised just a few minutes\" of his time. Two decades later, after years of unjustified suffering on a fortified island military base halfway around the world, Boumediene says the reality is clear: \"They destroyed my life.\" In the frenzied post-9/11 hunt for terrorists, the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay was pressed into service as what then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld famously called the \"least worst option\" to house suspected terrorists captured in what officials described as the new Global War on Terror. At its height, the facility held 800 men, each supposedly having varying degrees of ties to terrorists or terrorist groups. According to American intelligence, some of the inhabitants were known to be hardened veterans of anti-Western terrorism, including some of the alleged masterminds and organizers of the 9/11 attacks. Some had tenuous, though concrete, connections to suspected terrorists. And still others were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time. For Boumediene, merely having worked with a sibling of a known al-Qaeda terrorist may be what earned him a seven-and-a-half-year stay at a jail that has, to many, come to symbolize the mistakes and excesses of America\\'s response to the hijackings and killings of Sept. 11, 2001. \"Twenty years later, I can\\'t find the truth behind my imprisonment in Guantanamo,\" Boumediene said. Located some 500 miles southeast of Miami, Guantanamo spans a pristine stretch of shoreline on the Cuban coast. In many ways, the base looks and feels like a small Florida town, complete with beautiful beaches, an Irish pub and a McDonald\\'s. It earned a slice of fame in the 1992 Tom Cruise film \"A Few Good Men,\" but it is now known around the world as the home to some of America\\'s darkest hours. \"Anybody who does not know about Guantanamo I think today would be surprised at some of the things that went on there,\" said Marion \"Spike\" Bowman, the former deputy general counsel for national security at the FBI. Despite years of public outcry over conditions in the prison camp there -- and disputes over the legal justification for its existence -- 39 detainees still remain within its walls. \"The creation of Guantanamo was the right action at the beginning,\" said Roger Cressey, a former top counterterrorism official on the National Security Council during the administrations of both George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. \"And then it turned into Frankenstein\\'s monster.\" Gitmo, as many know it, wasn\\'t meant to be a monster, but a legal \"black hole.\" Former officials said Guantanamo was born out of necessity as a place to house those who needed to be held and interrogated when the U.S. attacked Afghanistan in order to destroy the terror network that committed the 9/11 attacks. The Bush administration determined that the Sept. 11 attacks were more akin to acts of war than a crime, so those captured in connection with 9/11 would be \"enemy combatants\" who would be tried in military courts -- instead of criminals who would have constitutional protections in the American legal system and would be tried in civilian courts. \"We worried about bringing these terrorists into the United States for a couple reasons,\" said Alberto R. Gonzales, a former Bush White House counsel and U.S. attorney general who was deeply involved in the decision-making. \"We felt the American people wouldn\\'t stand for it, to have these terrorists on American soil. We also were unsure about what rights -- constitutional rights -- that they would automatically secure once they were on American soil.\" The Bush administration sought to \"deal with them in a way that was out of the U.S. legal system,\" said retired Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, a former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell. Guantanamo Bay was the answer. The detainees would be transferred to the detention facility, where they would be interrogated and then tried in something called \"military commissions,\" a cross between a standard trial and a military court martial, which had been used -- albeit rarely -- in times of war. Within months of Sept. 11, Bush issued the order directing Rumsfeld to organize the commissions, effectively circumventing the U.S. court system. Separately, Rumsfeld also authorized 18 interrogation techniques in late 2002 that could be used on detainees said to be resisting -- including slapping and sleep deprivation. The two orders would come to define Guantanamo and serve as the backdrop for the debate over America\\'s actions in the name of a War on Terror that continues to rage. At the time, \"there was a lot of concern about a second wave\" of attacks, \"and being alert for that,\" Gonzales said. It was that sense of urgency to gather intelligence on possible follow-up attacks that led to Guantanamo\\'s worst abuses, according to Bowman, who also had been a naval intelligence officer and assistant judge advocate. Bowman eventually attempted unsuccessfully to talk Pentagon officials out of the abuses that allegedly occurred there. It was under those desperate circumstances that American officials resorted to the darker means of extracting information, called \"enhanced interrogation\" by some -- and \"torture\" by others. Fearing more attacks, U.S. officials sought approval for the techniques, which included extreme physical and psychological stresses. The newly approved interrogation methods set the stage for a dramatic intragovernmental conflict. The dispute pitted two groups of investigators -- one from the military, the other largely made up of intelligence officials -- against one another. The military investigators, dubbed the Criminal Investigation Task Force, sought to weed out innocents from the detainees. The intelligence officers, called Joint Task Force-Guantanamo, were dispatched to interrogate the detainees for information about future terrorist plots. Largely inexperienced in interrogation, they allegedly inflicted severe abuses on detainees who resisted questioning -- and then retroactively attempted to justify their methods through legal loopholes, according to documents and court cases. Many experts, including Susan Burke, a lawyer who has represented Guantanamo detainees, remain unconvinced of the legality of the methods. \"It has been well-established that you cannot torture people,\" said Burke. \"So, this notion that, somehow, because we use the vernacular of \\'Global War on Terror,\\' that we can do whatever we want to other human beings? Wholly illegal.\" Bowman became increasingly concerned by what agents based in Cuba were reporting back to FBI headquarters about what they had been witnessing a year after the 9/11 attacks. The dispatches described physical abuse and sexualized physical contact with the Muslim detainees, as well as duct-taping one prisoner\\'s head and forcing another to remain in a cell flooded with light for months without darkness, causing \"extreme psychological trauma,\" according to one FBI document. Critically, Bowman said, the forceful means to extract intelligence didn\\'t work in the first place, and then subsequently undermined efforts to gather reliable information -- ultimately shaping the public\\'s image of the camp. \"They wanted to do what they thought would be faster to get information than the FBI\\'s rapport-building type of activity,\" Bowman said. \"My problem was the techniques they were using were not techniques that had ever been proven to be effective in interrogation.\" Boumediene says he can still recall one night in particular -- during his early days at Guantanamo\\'s Camp X-Ray detention compound -- when he says \"they tried to break me.\" \"At two o\\'clock in the morning, the inspector said to the soldiers, \\'Come on, make him run,\\'\" Boumediene said. \"They forced me to run with them, but I couldn\\'t run because I was handcuffed. I couldn\\'t run with them. When I would fall, they would pull me along the gravel ... if I remember, ten days, 15 days like that, every day.\" In Washington, the dispute over aggressive interrogation techniques, including questions of whether they were illegal torture and if they were an effective instrument of intelligence-gathering, gave way to a fight over the legal justifications -- and whether such practices were permissible under the Geneva Conventions, a 1949 set of agreements regulating the use of force during wartime. Mindful of those requirements, officials even used a specific nomenclature for those being held. \"We weren\\'t calling them prisoners of war at that time, as I recall,\" Wilkerson said. \"We were calling them detainees, because that was the term of art that didn\\'t bespeak Geneva and so forth.\" The Bush administration made the case that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to al-Qaeda terrorists, interpreting those guidelines as \"an incentive to individuals to fight according to laws of war,\" Gonzales said, and asserting that the rules applied only to those fighting on behalf of the nearly 200 nations that signed the treaty in the wake of World War II. \"Because al-Qaeda had not been a signatory to the Geneva Conventions,\" Gonzales argued, \"they would not automatically qualify for the protections -- and the same thing with the Taliban.\" John Bellinger, who was the chief lawyer for the National Security Council on 9/11, said that denying accused terrorists protections under the Geneva Conventions had been a mistake. \"This opened us up to a huge amount of international criticism that we were holding detainees in Guantanamo ... in a legal black hole, in a law-free zone,\" he said. \"And to a certain extent, this was really true.\" The legal conundrum was compounded by reports of the mistreatment of detainees. As Rumsfeld and other Bush administration officials lauded the new interrogation techniques, those who witnessed them expressed horror -- and news reports started to emerge depicting the extreme conditions detainees were forced to endure. \"Secretary Rumsfeld was told about much of this stuff,\" Bowman said in a recent interview. \"He really just rolled it off. And that, frankly, rolls downhill.\" In November 2002, Rumsfeld even jotted in the margin of a memo authorizing harsh interrogation techniques for \"counter-resistance\" by saying, \"I stand for 8-10 hours a day. Why is standing limited to 4 hours?\" U.S. Air Force Reserve Capt. Mark McCary served as a judge advocate at Guantanamo, responsible for ensuring that Criminal Investigation Task Force interrogators drawn from each military branch\\'s investigative agencies remained within their legal bounds. A veteran of a decade of deployments that focused on counterterrorism, he arrived on the island base with a duffle bag filled with law books. What he soon learned of the JTF-Guantanamo interrogations \"did not comport with American values and principles that we\\'re trained with, including justice, Geneva Conventions, and the basic equities of interrogation and training,\" he said. McCary confronted military leaders and penned a series of memos outlining conditions at the camp and calling for intervention. The Pentagon ignored them. \"They didn\\'t appreciate my opinion or my legal assessment,\" he said. McCary redeployed back home. Guantanamo, he found, \"was a career-ender\" for him and for many judge advocates appointed as defense counsel or prosecutors in the military tribunals, he said. Meanwhile, Bowman, unable to persuade the Pentagon to abandon its program of \"enhanced interrogation,\" went to the press, he said. In early 2005, the New York Daily News ran a headline, \"AT WAR WITH GITMO GRILLING.\" \"Military lawyers at the Guantanamo Bay terrorist prison tried to stop inhumane interrogations but were ignored by senior Pentagon officials, the Daily News has learned,\" read the story. The article included details of a memo McCary had written outlining abuses at the prison camp. Bowman, who was quoted as an unidentified source in the story, characterized McCary as an \"unsung hero.\" \"I thought people needed to understand that there were people on the scene, not just in Washington like me, but people on the scene who were seeing what was going on, who were trying to make a difference. And I wanted that known,\" he said. McCary left his unit in March of 2003 and says he has not communicated with anyone at the Pentagon or the FBI since. What he witnessed at Guantanamo left him with scars of his own, he said. \"I desired to actually return to duty and could not do that because of a medical diagnosis: bipolar with PTSD,\" he said. \"There was a time where I could\\'ve been a homeless vet ... I struggled immensely with all of that.\" Two decades and three presidential administrations have passed since 9/11, and Guantanamo remains open -- albeit as a shadow of its former self. Its most high-profile inhabitant, Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, who has confessed to plotting the 9/11 attacks, remains there in legal limbo. He stands charged with killing nearly 3,000 people in the worst terror attack in history, and is awaiting trial as his case resumed this week following a delay in pretrial motions. \"The fact that the individuals responsible for 9/11 are sitting there -- they have not been tried -- the system that was designed to bring them to justice has proven to be a failure,\" said Matt Olsen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center who was charged with closing the prison under the Obama administration. Despite Guantanamo\\'s complicated legacy and the moral burden it placed on the American conscience, many officials responsible for what happened there stand by their decisions -- and claim that the ends justified the means. \"To the families of the victims, 20 years later, I would say that, even though these individuals are simply detained and not brought to justice in a court,\" Gonzales said, \"there is some level of justice in the detention itself.\" Others feel differently. \"Looking back 20 years later, I think it was correct to treat the response to 9/11 as a war, as an armed conflict,\" said Bellinger. \"But decisions that were subsequently made that flowed from that, the creation of military commissions, the decision not to apply the Geneva Conventions to the people who we were holding -- I think these were mistakes that were made by the Bush administration.\" In 2004, three years after 9/11, Boumediene and other detainees were finally afforded legal counsel. By 2007, Boumediene\\'s case reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices determined that Boumediene and other detainees were entitled to habeas corpus, the constitutional right of anyone detained in America to know the reasons for their arrest and detention. A federal judge then found that Boumediene should be released, citing a lack of evidence against him. \"And then it was over,\" Boumediene said. \"It is a day I will never forget.\" ABC News\\' Kate Holland, Lauren Minore, Lara Priluck, Emma Seiwell, Ibtissem Guenfoud, Jenny Wagnon Courts, Olivia Rubin, Tonya Simpson and Jinsol Jung contributed to this report.\\nWhen the second plane hit, Florence Jones had to find her own way to escape. Of the last 25 people who made it out of the World Trade Center\\'s south tower on Sept. 11, 2001, Florence Jones was number 18. Her story is one I have always carried with me. Sept. 11, 2001, was a beautiful morning, until it wasnt. Like so many, Florence has long described the clear, blue skies, and the kindness on full display. That morning was like so many others, until she says, it descended into hell on Earth. Florence worked as a manager on the 77th floor of the south tower. The north tower was hit first, and she remembers going up to 78th floor to tell colleagues they should leave. She went back down the escalator to the 77th floor and moments later, the second plane hit. Just one floor above her. Many of the colleagues she had just seen were now gone, including Jill Maurer Campbell, a young mother. Florence has always said she will never forget Jills smile, especially the day Jill brought her baby boy, Jake, to the office. When the second plane hit, Florence had to find her own way to escape. She joined a small group of colleagues and started down the smoke-filled stairwell, holding hands, holding each others shirts, guiding one another. She remembers her boss, fearing Florence might fall on the way down, suggesting she take her shoes off. He carried her shoes the rest of the way down. They helped each other out. For years, those debris-covered shoes sat in a box under her bed. Now, theyre in the 9/11 museum. Florence survived the attack on the twin towers and ever since, has always conveyed a quiet sense of purpose, a sense of responsibility after having survived that dark day. She has shared so many deeply personal reflections. For one, she will never forget looking out and seeing men and women in the north tower standing at the windows edge after the first plane hit. \"To see these young people doing the sign of the cross and jumping. Youre like, oh my God,\" she told me. It remains one of her most painful memories of that day. Florence has always said she didnt look away out of sheer dignity for those who had no choice. She believed someone needed to bear witness to their suffering. To this day, she says they were among the true heroes of that day. Ten years ago, she took me along on what used to her walk to work, past the fire station where she would always wave to the firefighters standing in the doorway. Florence had not been inside Ground Zero until she went with us then. The giant craters left from the towers were now reflecting pools. As we approached the pools, Florence put her hand to her face. And we knew. It all came flooding back. The loved ones, the colleagues, and the faces of those brave men and women who never made it out. Etched in bronze at the pools edge, among the thousands of names, was her friend\\'s -- Jill Maurer Campbell. Recently, 20 years after 9/11, Florence received a phone call from Jill\\'s son. Jake Campbell, who is now nearly 20 years old, asked her if she could offer anything she remembered about his mom. Florence told him of her smile, her kindness, and her one true joy: being a mother. She told Jake she remembers that she had never seen his mother happier then that day she brought him to the office all those years ago. Then, having learned of Jake\\'s own life -- he\\'s now a student at the University of Michigan -- Florence told him that his mother would have been very proud of him. On this 20th anniversary of 9/11, I had the chance to meet Jake. He told me those words from Florence were a gift.

On a Wednesday afternoon that turned cloudy with the temperature in the 70s and a few sprinkles in the air and adoring fans chanting his name, the former New York Yankees star shortstop and captain was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame after a long wait necessitated by the pandemic. Greeted by raucous cheers in a crowd estimated at 20,000 that included NBA luminaries Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing, several of his former teammates, and Hall of Fame Yankees manager Joe Torre on the stage behind him, Jeter took his turn after fellow inductees from the class of 2020 Ted Simmons, Larry Walker and the late Marvin Miller were honored. Jeter was touched by the moment and acknowledged how different the ceremony seemed in the wake of the recent deaths of 10 Hall of Famers. \"I\\'m so honored to be inducted with you guys and linked to you forever,\" he said. \"The Hall of Fame is special because of those who are in it. We\\'ve lost way too many Hall of Famers over the last 20 months. These are all Hall of Famers who would have or could have been here, so for that reason it\\'s not the same.\" What was the same was the adoration displayed by the fans, who always marveled at his consistency. \"I had one goal in my career, and that was to win more than everyone else, and we did that, which brings me to the Yankee fans,\" Jeter said as the fans erupted again. \"Without question, you helped me get here today as much as any individual I\\'ve mentioned.\" He gave much of the credit to his parents, who were in the audience with Jeter\\'s wife, Hannah, and their two young daughters. \"Mom, you taught me any dream is attainable as long as you work harder than everyone else. You drilled that in my head over and over and over and you led me to believe it,\" Jeter said. \"You told me never to make excuses, you wouldnt allow me to use the word cant. Dad, youve been the voice of reason. You taught me to be patient, to listen and think before I speak. Youve always been there for advice and to this day youre the first person I go to. I know when I retired you said you played every game with me and I know you recall from time to time telling me, \\'You keep building that resume. Look where its gotten us today.\" The ceremony was delayed a year because of the coronavirus pandemic and it didn\\'t matter much to Walker, the second Canadian elected to the Hall of Fame. He gave up hockey when he was 16 to focus on baseball. He was selected in his 10th and final year on the writers\\' ballot after a stellar career with Montreal, Colorado and St. Louis that included 383 homers and three batting titles. \"Its taken a little longer to reach this day (but) for all your support I\\'ve received throughout the years from my home country, I share this honor with every Canadian,\" said Walker, who retired in 2005. \"I hope that all you Canadian kids out there that have dreams of playing in the big leagues, that see me here today gives you another reason to go after those dreams. To my adopted home, the United States, I thank you for allowing this Canadian kid to come into your country to live and play your great pastime. I think we\\'re all pretty fortunate to have two amazing countries side by side.\" The 72-year-old Simmons, who starred in a 21-year career with the St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee and Atlanta, punctuated his speech to thank four pioneers of free agency -- Curt Flood, Catfish Hunter, Andy Messersmith and Marvin Miller -- \"who changed the lives of every player on this stage today by pushing the boundaries of player rights.\" \"Marvin Miller made so much possible for every major league player from my era to the present and the future,\" the former catcher said. \"I could not be more proud to enter this great hall with this great man. Even though my path has been on the longer side, I wouldnt change a thing. However we get here, none of us arrives alone. Im no exception.\" Miller, who transformed baseball on the labor front by building a strong players union and led the charge for free agency in the mid-1970s, was honored posthumously. Four years before he died at 95 in 2012, Miller respectfully asked to be removed from consideration for the Hall of Fame after being passed over several times. \"One thing a trade union leader learns to do is how to count votes in advance. Whenever I took one look at what I was faced with, it was obvious to me it was not gonna happen,\" Miller, head of the Major League Baseball Players Association from 1966-83, wrote in 2008. \"If considered and elected, I will not appear for the induction if Im alive. If they proceed to try to do this posthumously, my family is prepared to deal with that.\" The family didn\\'t. Instead, Don Fehr, who was hired by Miller to be the union\\'s general counsel in 1977 and succeeded him eight years later, had the honor. \"Of all the players I had the privilege to represent, I want to thank you Marvin,\" said Fehr, now the head of the National Hockey League Players Association. \"Baseball was not the same after your tenure as it was before. It was and is much better for everyone. You brought out the best of us and you did us proud.\" The virus forced the Hall of Fame to cancel last year\\'s ceremony and this year\\'s was moved from its customary slot on a Sunday in late July to a midweek date. ------ More AP MLB: https://apnews.comJ/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports\\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Thursday that federal government employees and contractors will now be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration will create a rule for private businesses with 100 or more employees to require their employees to be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing. The requirements are part of Biden\\'s sweeping new six-part strategy to combat the delta variant, which was rolled out in remarks from Biden at the White House. A senior administration official estimated that this new OSHA requirement will cover about 80 million workers and businesses that do not comply with the agency\\'s rule can face substantial fees -- up to $14,000. OSHA will require these employers to offer paid time off for vaccination. \"My job as president is to protect all Americans,\" Biden said before announcing the broad mandates. As part of his effort to vaccinate the federal executive branch, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Indian Health Service and the National Institutes of Health will complete implementation of their previously announced vaccination requirements that cover 2.5 million people. This is an escalation of the president\\'s action in July calling for federal workers to attest to their vaccination status and submit to mitigation efforts if they are not vaccinated, such as mask usage and regular testing. \"We\\'re in the tough stretch and it could last for a while,\" Biden said Thursday. He also took aim at Republican officials who have worked to outlaw public health mandates in their states, like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. \"To make matters worse, there are elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19,\" he continued. \"Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated and mask up, they\\'re ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from COVID in their communities. This is totally unacceptable.\" The president also announced that the Transportation Security Administration\\'s interstate travel mask mandate will be extended through Jan. 18, the fine for noncompliance will double and health care facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement must require their employees to be vaccinated. This will cover about 17 million health care workers across the country. Biden also appealed directly to unvaccinated Americans to do their part. \"My message to unvaccinated Americans is this: What more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see? We\\'ve made vaccinations free, safe, and convenient. The vaccine has FDA approval. Over 200 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. We\\'ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin. And your refusal has cost all of us. So, please, do the right thing,\" Biden said. The largest federal law enforcement union FLEOA, pushed back on the president\\'s vaccine mandate, in a statement released Thursday. \"A mandate at this time only undermines these voluntary vaccination efforts and reduces public comfort in getting vaccinated,\" President Larry Cosme said. Speaking at her daily briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Biden would \"outline the next phase in the fight against the virus and what that looks like, including measures to work with the public and private sector.\" She said he would be \"building on the steps that we\\'ve already announced, the steps we\\'ve taken over the last few months, requiring more vaccinations, boosting important testing measures and more, making it safer for kids to go to school, all at a time when the American people are listening. Again, this will be six steps that we\\'ll work to be implementing over the months ahead.\" Biden\\'s plan also increases testing availability and lowers the cost of at-home tests, extends masking requirements for interstate travel and on federal property, and provides additional aid to struggling small businesses. But besides ordering the nation\\'s 2.1 million federal employees and 1.3 million active duty service members get vaccinated, Biden has limited legal authority to institute a broad vaccine mandate for most Americans. About 75% of the adult U.S. population has received at least one vaccine dose and 64.4% of the adult U.S. population is fully vaccinated as of Wednesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll showed Americans in August souring on Biden\\'s handling of the pandemic, with his approval rating for his handling or the response dropping 10 points from June, down to 52% Biden\\'s remarks are scheduled for just 11 days before the administration is set to begin widely rolling out booster shots of Pfizer on Sept. 20, a process mired by confusion as some public health experts say the data doesn\\'t yet support the need for boosters. ABC News\\' Luke Barr contributed to this report.\\nThe sky was clear and blue. The gray towers stood, both guarding and welcoming, at the gateway to the nation. Out of nowhere came the impact, the blaze, the smoke -- and then the towers were gone. When the dust and flames finally cleared, a new world had emerged. The death and destruction defined that late summer day and remain seared in the minds of those who lived through Sept. 11, 2001. From the ashes and wreckage rose a new America: a society redefined by its scars and marked by a new wartime reality -- a shadow darkened even more in recent days by the resurgence of fundamentalist Islamist rule in the far-off land that hatched the attacks. Twenty years later -- with more than 70 million Americans born since the crucible of the attacks -- the legacy of 9/11 remains. From airport security to civilian policing to the most casual parts of daily life, it would be nearly impossible to identify something that remains untouched and unaffected by those terrifying hours in 2001. This week, ABC News revisits the 9/11 attacks and unwinds their aftermath, taking a deep look at the America born in the wake of destruction. \"9/11 Twenty Years Later: The Longest Shadow\" is a five-part documentary series narrated by George Stephanopoulos. Episodes will air on ABC News Live each night leading up to the 20th anniversary of the attacks, from Sept. 6-10. The series will be rebroadcast in full following the commemoration ceremonies on Saturday, Sept. 11. Part 5: A shadow so long, it covers all The blue light may have been the strangest part. On the streets of Baltimore, where crime proliferates in the poorest neighborhoods and economic desperation can run thick, the blue cast made it feel like one of those science-fiction movies set in a dark future of robots in control. \"I found it extremely oppressive and dystopian,\" said Joanne Cavanaugh Simpson, a contributor to Baltimore magazine and a Pulitzer Center grantee. The blue lights are meant to be seen. They are security cameras, and police want them to both solve crimes and deter them. In the city famed as the birthplace of America\\'s national anthem, the lights announce that the people are being watched. Critics say these neighborhoods coated in blue also represent something else: the failures of an overzealous surveillance state, militarized and armed to the hilt in the years since terrorists attacked the nation on Sept. 11, 2001. Despite the city\\'s high-tech efforts to curb crime, Baltimore still suffers from some of the highest homicide rates in the country. The city\\'s public image -- shaped for many by the HBO crime drama \"The Wire\" -- remains tethered to the fraught relationship between the police and the community. For Baltimore and other major metropolitan areas, ubiquitous surveillance and a tragic cycle of police-involved killings continue to animate the debate over U.S. law enforcement. Many of the most controversial policing practices date to 9/11, when local governments were flooded with a surge of money, technology and new crime-fighting strategies -- on top of a new mindset that assigned local cops to the front lines of the Global War on Terror. It was a time when many police departments re-fashioned themselves as paramilitary organizations, as their core mission was recalibrated from performing the traditional role of \"protect and serve\" to preventing the feared \"second wave\" of attacks for a terrorized and traumatized nation. Police departments across the country, eager to avoid the failures that led to 9/11, scrambled to equip officers with the latest in military equipment and technology -- much of it made available by a federal government that would spend almost 20 years at war in Afghanistan and Iraq. And the police forces -- always eager to hire military veterans -- were being staffed by people trained to police populations under occupation, not communities on the home front who get to decide how they want to be governed. Critics charged that racial profiling proliferated in cities like Baltimore, where the blinking blue lights became a symbol of life under a surveillance state. \"Over-policing, the racial tension -- it just exponentially grew for local policing,\" said Chris Burbank, a former police chief in Salt Lake City, who\\'s now a vice president at the Center for Policing Equity. From aerial surveillance in Baltimore to national terrorist watch lists, local police departments experimented with novel approaches to securing their streets in the years following 9/11. A scarred nation largely acquiesced. Over time, critics of these methods say that the trauma suffered by heavily policed communities -- and the toll on residents\\' civil liberties -- have done more harm than good. As protests erupted across the country in the wake of George Floyd\\'s death in 2020, the gap between police departments and the citizens they are sworn to protect had never seemed wider. \"This separation between policing and community, I think you have to view 9/11 as gasoline that was poured on that fire,\" said Lawrence Grandpre, a Baltimore-based community activist and author. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, a wariness of Muslims swept the country. Hate crimes against Muslims skyrocketed. Mosques became inundated with threats. \"Anything that showed that you were an Arab or a Muslim caused everyone to be suspicious of you,\" said Sahar Aziz, director of the Center for Security, Race and Rights at Rutgers University Law School. In response to the terror attacks, police departments in some major cities compiled vast databases of alleged potential terrorists and undertook ambitious surveillance missions targeting Muslim communities. \"You had massive surveillance programs by the NYPD, and the LAPD, and the FBI,\" said Aziz. \"Muslim student organizations at universities, Muslim-owned businesses, mosques, anywhere where Muslims congregated was systematically surveilled ... we were sitting ducks.\" At the time of the attacks, the conversation around law enforcement was trending toward stricter guidelines for equitable policing -- including halting some of the most invasive tactics like stop-and-frisk. Years of advocacy and lobbying in Washington culminated in the End Racial Profiling Act -- a bill incoming President George W. Bush supported on the campaign trail in 2000. \"And then 2001, 9/11 happened, and it was completely off the table,\" Aziz said. \"It was a nonstarter.\" Before the 2001 terror attacks, John Farmer was the New Jersey attorney general who led the push to reform a state police culture that had itself acknowledged racial profiling and had vowed to eliminate it. After the attacks, as Farmer served as senior counsel to the 9/11 Commission, he said he had to watch as 9/11 \"had the effect of deferring the debate on racial profiling.\" \"Suddenly,\" Farmer said, \"no one wanted to talk about it anymore.\" Over the next decade, as American military forces engaged terrorists abroad, veterans of war returned home to continue their service as police officers. Together, with the influx of weapons of war, police throughout the U.S. began to look more and more like they were deployed on a forward operating military base. \"Police departments all over the country have acquired a pretty significant amount of military-grade weapons and equipment since 9/11,\" said Loren Crowe, an Army officer who served two deployments overseas. \"My local police department would be well-equipped to go fight in the mountains in Afghanistan.\" It all amounted to a post-9/11 \"over-policing\" that has had debilitating effects on police-community relations, according to many who have spent their careers in law enforcement. \"At that time there was so much fear in communities because of 9/11,\" said Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison, who experienced the changes as he worked his way up through the ranks in the New Orleans Police Department. \"And it became a concept of more police -- and do more with more police.\" In Baltimore, where the death of Freddie Gray in 2016 ignited nationwide protests and added new urgency to the debate over post-9/11 policing, the local police department led the charge in advancing novel and controversial police tactics. Blue-light cameras flooded crime-prone streets. Facial recognition software and phone data collection were employed to fight crime. Perhaps the most jarring to residents were the so-called \"spy planes\" deployed to surveil large swaths of the city. Launched in 2016, the nation\\'s first-ever aerial surveillance experiment was meant to be secret. The manned airplanes\\' immense capabilities allowed them to record the outdoor movements of an entire city. An independent audit later found that nearly all of the spy planes\\' flights tracked over majority Black communities. The police department has since suspended the program, and Harrison, the new commissioner, is focused on mending the strained relationship between the police and the community. \"Let\\'s try to tamper down the militaristic look and mindset, and move away from the warrior model into the guardian model, where we\\'re guardians of our community, not necessarily warriors of the community,\" says Harrison. Still, wounds run deep. \"Baltimore is one of the cities that is a pioneer in surveilling its own citizens,\" said Simpson, who has reported on the city\\'s surveillance programs for Baltimore magazine. \"There\\'s a lot of desperation to get a handle on the crime ... so Baltimore has become a destination for police surveillance technology companies, to try out their wares.\" Grandpre, the community organizer, said this experimentation with electronic surveillance \"just exacerbates the notion of a divide between the police force and the community.\" \"After 9/11 and with Baltimore\\'s high crime rate, there\\'s a notion that anything is acceptable,\" Grandpre said. Now, two decades on, Americans are finally returning to pre-9/11 conversations about policing and what it really means for a nation to govern itself. \"Absolutely there\\'s bias. Absolutely there\\'s racism. And we can start to talk about some of these things,\" said Burbank. Supporters of these police programs stress the need to try something new and different. \"What we\\'ve been doing has not been working,\" said Joyous Jones, a retired nurse and proponent of police surveillance in Baltimore, who decided to start working for the surveillance company running the planes after the program became public. \"The [American Civil Liberties Union] and all those people that really complain about their civil liberties -- I don\\'t have that because when I walk outside, I have to look and dodge bullets,\" Jones said. Jones is not alone in her support for the programs. \"There was public support for it,\" Commissioner Harrison said. \"There were community surveys that were in high percentage in favor of it ... and we looked at all of that.\" But after a year of high-profile police-involved killings and a spike in violent crime in many cities, reformers continue to ask: Are these police practices even working? \"People talk about the dichotomy: Do we want security, or do we want liberty? But some of the experts I spoke with say that\\'s sort of a false dichotomy,\" Simpson said. \"Are you getting more security with this technology? Is the crime rate in Baltimore getting better? No.\" \"All these technologies have been added, a lot of them since 9/11,\" Simpson said. \"And what are you losing by deploying all this?\" ABC News\\' Sarah Kate Caliguire, Alexandra Myers, Abigail Roberts and Tom Sampson contributed to this report.\\nThe Justice Department has filed suit against the state of Texas to block its law banning most abortions, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Thursday, setting up a high-stakes legal battle after the Supreme Court allowed the law to go into effect earlier this month. \"That act is clearly unconstitutional under long-standing Supreme Court precedent,\" Garland said at a news conference. \"Those precedents hold, in the words of Planned Parenthood versus Casey, that \\'regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular circumstances, a state may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.\\'\" He accused Texas Republicans of crafting a \"statutory scheme\" through the law \"to nullify the Constitution of the United States.\" \"It does not rely on the state\\'s executive branch to enforce the law, as is the norm in Texas and everywhere else. Rather, the snatcher deputizes all private citizens without any showing a personal connection or injury to serve as bounty hunters authorized to recover at least $10,000 per claim from individuals who facilitate a woman\\'s exercise of our constitutional rights,\" he said. As part of its lawsuit, Garland said the DOJ is seeking an immediate court order preventing the enforcement of SB8 in Texas. Garland also made clear that the Justice Department won\\'t hesitate to take similar legal action against other states that might pursue a similar route to restrict abortions. \"The additional risk here is that other states will follow similar models,\" Garland said, and he denied that the decision to file the suit now was in any way based on political pressure from Democrats or the White House. The lawsuit accuses Texas lawmakers of enacting the law \"in open defiance of the Constitution.\" \"The United States has the authority and responsibility to ensure that Texas cannot evade its obligations under the Constitution and deprive individuals of their constitutional rights by adopting a statutory scheme designed specifically to evade traditional mechanisms of federal judicial review,\" the lawsuit says. \"The federal government therefore brings this suit directly against the State of Texas to obtain a declaration that S.B. 8 is invalid, to enjoin its enforcement, and to protect the rights that Texas has violated.\" The suit also alleges that the law conflicts with federal law by intending to prohibit federal agencies from carrying out their responsibilities related to abortion services. \"Because S.B. 8 does not contain an exception for cases of rape or incest, its terms purport to prohibit the federal government and its employees and agents from performing, funding, reimbursing, or facilitating abortions in such cases,\" the lawsuit says. Garland cautioned that the Texas law should concern all Americans, regardless of their politics. \"This kind of scheme to nullify the Constitution of the United States is one that all Americans, whatever their politics or party, should fear. If it prevails, it may become a model for action in other areas by other states and with respect to other constitutional rights and judicial precedents,\" he said. \"Nor one need think hard or long to realize the damage that would be done to our society if states were allowed to implement laws that empower any private individual to infringe on another\\'s constitutionally protected rights in this way. The United States has the authority and the responsibility to ensure that no state can deprive individuals of their constitutional rights through a legislative scheme specifically designed to prevent the vindication of those rights,\" he said. The Texas statute, which is the most restrictive abortion law in the country, bars physicians from providing abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, or as soon as six weeks into a pregnancy -- often before a woman would even know they were pregnant. There is an exception for medical emergencies, but not in cases of rape or incest. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court formally rejected a request by Texas abortion providers to block the state\\'s severe new law as legal challenges continue. The unsigned order from the court said the providers had \"raised serious questions regarding the constitutionality of the Texas law at issue,\" but added \"their application also presents complex and novel antecedent procedural questions\" that they were unable to resolve. The new law has triggered outrage from those who support a women\\'s right to an abortion nationwide. Companies like Uber and Lyft have offered to pay legal fees for any driver who is sued under the law and dating apps Match and Bumble, both headquartered in Texas, pledged to support women seeking abortions. On the other side, many state lawmakers have said they intend to copy the wording of the Texas law in order to enact similar bans in their states.

On Thursday morning, the baby\\'s mother drove three children -- ages 5, 3 and 1 -- to day care, where she dropped off the 5-year-old and 3-year-old, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said. The mother returned home and went about her day and apparently switched cars at some point, Gonzalez said. She returned to the day care late Thursday afternoon expecting to pick up three kids, but the staff told her only two were dropped off, the sheriff said. The mother went back home where she found the 1-year-old girl in the back seat of a car at about 6 p.m., Harris County Sheriff\\'s Sgt. Ben Beall told reporters. The baby, who had been in car since 8:30 a.m., was pronounced dead at the scene, Beall said. This marks the 20th hot car death this year, according to national nonprofit KidsAndCars.org. Texas ranks No. 1 in the country for hot car deaths, with a total of 145 fatalities since 1991. A record 54 children died in hot cars in 2018, followed by 53 fatalities in 2019, according to KidsAndCars.org. Last year, 25 children died in hot cars, a drop that KidsAndCars.org director Amber Rollins attributed to the pandemic.

The 11-year-old is expected to recover from her injuries, but authorities said what she experienced may haunt her for the rest of her life. Polk County, Florida, authorities said the girl witnessed Bryan Riley, 33, allegedly shoot her father, Justice Gleason, 40; her dad\\'s girlfriend, Theresa Lanham, 33; and her 3-month-old brother in the Sunday morning massacre near Lakeland, 35 miles east of Tampa. Riley is also accused of killing Lanham\\'s 62-year-old mother, Catherine Delgado. Riley allegedly shot and killed the family\\'s dog, too, officials said. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Gleason\\'s daughter, the sole survivor of the attack, told investigators how she avoided being killed, after allegedly being tortured and shot by the stranger who had zero connection to her family. \"This 11-year-old was very brave and very smart, and she out-thought him. She said, \\'I played dead and I prayed,\\'\" Judd said at a news conference Thursday. Riley is charged with four counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, seven counts of attempted first-degree murder on a law enforcement officer, shooting into an occupied dwelling, two counts of armed burglary with battery, arson and cruelty to an animal. He is being held without bond. The sheriff said Riley has shown no remorse. \"He\\'s evil,\" Judd said. Judd said Riley first showed up at the home around 7 p.m. Saturday after picking up a first-aid kit from a friend who lives nearby, which he claimed he planned to donate to a Hurricane Ida relief organization. Upon leaving his friend\\'s home, he saw Gleason mowing his front yard and stopped. He allegedly told Gleason that God sent him to speak to a girl named Amber, who he claimed was suicidal and being held as a sex-trafficking victim, Judd said. He was told no one by that name lived at the address and was ordered to leave. The family called deputies, but they could not find Riley, Judd said. He said Riley returned to the home about 4:30 a.m. Sunday armed with three guns and in full-body armor. Judd said Riley, who as a Marine was deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, allegedly told investigators that he \"created an ops plan.\\'\" \"In his confession, he said, \\'You know what that means? You have to kill everybody,\\'\" said Judd, adding that Riley\\'s girlfriend told investigators he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. He said the suspect broke into an in-law unit behind the main house and killed Delgado. Riley allegedly shot his way into the main house and found Gleason, Lanham, her baby and the girl hiding in a bathroom, according to the sheriff. After allegedly killing Gleason, Lanham and the baby, Judd said, Riley took the girl into the living room and questioned her about the whereabouts of Amber, Judd said. When the girl told him she didn\\'t know Amber, he allegedly counted down, \"three, two, one\" and shot her in the stomach, Judd said. When she again denied knowing Amber, Riley allegedly shot her in the hand and legs before firing what he wrongly believed to be the fatal shot, Judd said. When deputies arrived, a shootout ensued. Riley was hit in the stomach and surrendered, Judd said. Judd said the sheriff\\'s department is collecting donations to help the family with funeral costs and the young survivor\\'s hospital bills. He said his agency has established an online page to accept contributions.\\nAfter banning sale of nearly 950,000 lesser-known e-cigarette products, the Food and Drug Administration has delayed its decision related to products made by Juul, the largest e-cigarette manufacturer. The FDA had a court-ordered Sept. 9 deadline to review 6.5 million applications for so-called \"new tobacco products,\" primarily electronic nicotine-containing products, from over 500 companies to determine whether these devices are safe and can stay on the market. On Thursday, the FDA said it had reviewed more than 90% of those applications, saying it would \"continue to work expeditiously on the remaining applications ... many of which are in the final stages of review,\" according to a statement. But Juul is the biggest e-cigarette maker in the U.S. and its products comprise the lion\\'s share of the market. The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids called the move \"a significant step in the right direction,\" but failure to ban all e-cigarettes \"leaves kids at risk.\" The American Lung Association, meanwhile, said it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the delayed decision on Juul and other products. After years of mounting concern about the youth vaping epidemic, the FDA in recent years has taken progressively tougher regulatory actions over the e-cigarette industry, first prohibiting the sale of candy- and fruit-flavored products that are more appealing to children, and later requiring even more products to cease sales. E-cigarettes were originally envisioned as a replacement for traditional cigarettes among adults who already smoke. But \"the biggest threat with e-cigarettes is that it\\'s easy to try nicotine for the first time,\" said Marielle Brinkman, a tobacco and cancer researcher at The Ohio State University. E-cigarettes contain high amounts of addictive nicotine and are easy to conceal and use. In a statement, the FDA said flavored e-cigarette products are \"extremely popular among youth, with over 80% of e-cigarette users ages 12 through 17 using them.\" These children and teens are typically not regular smokers, but are at risk of becoming addicted to nicotine through vaping. E-cigarettes can also harm brain development in youth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and pose risks of developing other illnesses in the future. Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA\\'s Center for Tobacco Products, has said that according to current regulations, \"the burden is on the [manufacturer] to provide evidence to demonstrate that the marketing of their product meets the ... standard \\'appropriate for the protection of the public health.\\'\" In a statement, Juul Labs said, \"We respect the central role of the FDA and the required thorough science- and evidence-based review of our applications, which is key to advancing harm reduction and earning a license to operate. We remain committed to transitioning adult smokers away from combustible cigarettes while combating underage use.\" Some studies show a benefit of e-cigarettes in helping smokers quit. However, the FDA must decide whether these products have enough potential benefit that outweighs the risks presented for youth. Given their highly addictive nature and the risk of illnesses linked to e-cigarettes, the standard is very high for companies to convince the FDA they help people quit smoking.

The state health department is investigating eight reports of pregnant women who died from COVID-19 in the past four weeks, all of whom were unvaccinated, Mississippi State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said at the top of a COVID-19 briefing Wednesday. \"We do know that COVID is especially problematic and dangerous for pregnant women,\" Dobbs said. \"We also know it can be deadly for the baby in the womb.\" Compared to the rate pre-pandemic, the health department has seen a \"doubling of the rate of fetal demise, or the death of the baby in the womb after 20 weeks,\" Dobbs said. \"It\\'s been a real tragedy.\" The warning comes as a majority of pregnant women nationwide have yet to be vaccinated. About three out of four pregnant women in the U.S. have not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pregnant women are at higher risk for severe illness if they contract COVID-19, including \"intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and death,\" compared to nonpregnant women, according to the CDC. As of Monday, at least 147 pregnant women had died from COVID-19 nationwide during the pandemic, according to CDC data. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the professional association for OB-GYNs, recommends that all eligible people, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, get the COVID-19 vaccine. Last month, the CDC also strengthened its recommendation for vaccination in pregnant women, with Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky saying \"it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible Delta variant and see severe outcomes from COVID-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people.\" After reporting six COVID-19 fatalities in pregnant women from March 2020 to January 2021, Mississippi has had seven since May, including four in the month of August alone, state data shows. The data does not reflect all recent maternal deaths from COVID-19, pending an investigation from the health department, a spokesperson said. \"Delta is different, and delta is deadly, and we need to do everything we can to prevent transmission,\" Dobbs said. The health department was still gathering details on the most recent maternal fatalities and the status of the infants, with more information to come next week. It was confirmed that several of the infants were born prematurely, \"but are alive,\" Dobbs said Wednesday. The health department reported a pediatric death due to COVID-19 on Wednesday, but that was not related to any of the maternal deaths, he said. Health officials pleaded with pregnant women who had not yet been vaccinated to get the shot, along with the general public. Only 47.6% of Mississippi residents ages 12 and up are fully vaccinated, fourth-lowest in the U.S., compared to 62.5% nationwide, according to CDC data. \"It\\'s getting easier and easier to find Mississippians that have a story about the tragedy from the delta variant,\" Jim Craig, senior deputy and director of health protection for the Mississippi\\'s health department, said during the briefing. \"Don\\'t let that be a pregnant mom and expectant family.\" Editor\\'s note: This story has been updated with a revised number of COVID-19 deaths in pregnant women reported throughout the pandemic in Mississippi after the state health department updated its data.\\nAsked about threats to sue the federal government, Biden said, \"Have at it.\" Taking his toughest tone yet against those Americans still unvaccinated, President Joe Biden has triggered vows of legal challenges from GOP governors representing some of the very states where he\\'s trying to use mandates to get more people inoculated. At least 19 Republican governors have lashed back at Biden\\'s promise to use OSHA to pressure employers with more than 100 employees to mandate COVID-19 vaccines or have workers submit to weekly testing. The Republican governors called the mandate an overreach that will force Americans to choose between their job and the vaccine. While Biden said on Friday morning, during a visit to local middle school, that all scientists would agree with his new strategy -- that using protecting public health as a justification for mandates makes \"considerable sense,\" his taking a combative tone may come with new political and public health risks and further polarize Americans, fueling the already bitter political divide around the pandemic. South Dakota GOP Gov. Kristi Noem, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, tweeted to Biden, \"see you in court,\" while Mississippi GOP Gov. Tate Reeves compared him to a \"tyrant,\" and South Carolina GOP Gov. Henry McMaster said he\\'ll \"fight them to the gates of hell\" to stop the move. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called Biden\\'s approach \"flat-out un-American.\" When ABC News Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott asked Biden on Friday what his message was to Republicans threatening to challenge his move in court, he responded, \"Have at it.\" He continued, \"Look, I am so disappointed that particularly some Republican governors have been so cavalier with the health of these kids, so cavalier with the health of their communities. We\\'re playing for real here -- this isn\\'t a game.\" While Biden has previously said he wouldn\\'t impose vaccine mandates, he said Friday that vaccine requirements are \"nothing new.\" However, past vaccines requirements for measles, mumps and rubella, for instance, have historically been implemented at a state and local level -- and at times when the country wasn\\'t already so divided politically In his address to the nation on Thursday introducing his new six-part approach, a frustrated Biden went after the unvaccinated and elected officials for standing in the way of public health measures and, he said, causing people to die. \"These pandemic politics, as I refer to it, are making people sick, causing unvaccinated people to die. We cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of the large majority of Americans who have done their part and want to get back to life as normal,\" Biden said. \"My message to unvaccinated Americans is this: What more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see?\" he said. \"We\\'ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin. And your refusal has cost all of us.\" He called out the governors, many of whom are now criticizing his approach, saying, \"if these governors won\\'t help us beat the pandemic, I\\'ll use my power as president to get them out of the way.\" He added, \"Let me be blunt. My plan also takes on elected officials in states that are undermining you and these life-saving actions. Right now, local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic while their governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salaries or their jobs,\" he said. He promised his administration would to pay back salaries withheld from those opposing mask bans. White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked on Friday what caused Biden and the rest of the administration to change its tune on blaming the unvaccinated for the pandemic -- after Psaki said in June that she didnt want to place blame. She said Biden on Thursday was \"channeling the frustration\" of millions who are vaccinated as the pandemic rages, while pointing a finger at Republicans. \"We didn\\'t anticipate, I will say, that when there was a vaccine approved under a Republican president, that the Republican president took, that there would be such hesitation, opposition vehement opposition in some cases from so many people of his own party in this country,\" she said. While 75% of adults have gotten a shot, per data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccinations have stalled in recent months despite widespread availability as the hospitals across the country face another surge of the virus timed with the start of a new school year. Biden\\'s new approach to getting more shots into arms comes as his approval for handling the pandemic has dropped sharply from 62% in June to 52% now. The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll found also that vaccine hesitancy has subsided in the face of the delta surge, with the share of Americans who are disinclined to get a coronavirus shot now just half what it was last January. Among those unvaccinated adults, about 7 in 10 are skeptical of the vaccines\\' safety and effectiveness, 9 in 10 see vaccination as a personal choice rather than a broader responsibility and just 16% have been encouraged by someone close to them to get a shot. It\\'s unclear if Biden will break through to that group. A White House spokesman declined to say whether public polling on why certain people remain unvaccinated informed the decision to institute these new requirements, or otherwise explain how Americans\\' attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines impacted the president\\'s decision. The spokesman said the decision to enact the new requirements was \"not rooted in any political focus, rather on what\\'s going to work.\" As some GOP governors say they\\'re preparing lawsuits, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients in defending the mandates on Friday argued that COVID-19 is a \"public health issue, not a political issue.\" \"We know that vaccination requirements work,\" Zients said, pointing to \"significant increases in vaccination rates at companies, health care systems, universities, that implement vaccine requirements.\" As Biden did on Thursday, Zients pointed specifically to companies like Fox News -- which has provided a platform for vaccine misinformation and has repeatedly railed against Biden\\'s COVID-19 response -- but which is also participating in a version of a vaccination reporting requirement itself. \"The president\\'s actions will accelerate that number of companies across the board for employers over a hundred, and that includes Fox News, which already has that vaccination requirement in place to keep its own employees safe.\" ABC News\\' Ben Gittleson and Sasha Peznik contributed to this report.\\nAn estimated 200 foreigners, including Americans, have left Kabul on an international commercial flight, marking the first large-scale evacuation since U.S. and NATO forces left Afghanistan last week KABUL, Afghanistan -- An estimated 200 foreigners, including Americans, left Afghanistan on a commercial flight out of Kabul on Thursday, the first such large-scale departure since U.S. and other forces completed their frantic withdrawal over a week ago. The Qatar Airways flight to Doha marked a breakthrough in the bumpy coordination between the U.S. and Afghanistans new Taliban rulers. A dayslong standoff over charter planes at another airport has left dozens of passengers stranded. A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasnt authorized to talk to the media, provided the number of Westerners on the Qatar flight and said two senior Taliban officials helped facilitate the departure -- the new foreign minister and deputy prime minister. Americans, U.S. green card holders and other nationalities, including Germans, Hungarians and Canadians, were aboard, the official said. Qatari envoy Mutlaq bin Majed al-Qahtani said another 200 passengers will leave Afghanistan on Friday. A diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity, also because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said foreigners, including Americans, will depart in the next couple of days. It was not immediately clear how many Americans were on board Thursday and how many were still in Afghanistan. The White House said before the flight that there were roughly 100 American citizens left in Afghanistan. But several veterans groups have said that number is too low, off by perhaps hundreds. And they said it overlooks green-card- carrying permanent residents who lived in the U.S. for years and should also be evacuated. Many thousands of Afghans remain desperate to get out, afraid of what Taliban rule might hold. The Taliban have repeatedly said foreigners and Afghans with proper travel documents could leave. But their assurances have been meet with skepticism, even with the departure of the Qatar flight. U.S. lawmakers, veterans groups and others are pressing the Biden administration to ensure that former Afghan military interpreters and others who could be in danger of Taliban reprisals for working with the Americans are allowed to leave. As Taliban authorities patrolled the tarmac on Thursday, passengers presented their documents for inspection and dogs sniffed luggage laid out on the ground. Some veteran airport employees had returned to their jobs after fleeing during the harrowing chaos of the U.S.-led airlift. Irfan Popalzai, 12, boarded the flight with his mother and five brothers and sisters. He said his family lives in Maryland. \"I am an Afghan, but you know I am from America and I am so excited\" to leave, he said. Before the airliner took off, Qatari officials gathered on the tarmac to announce the airport was ready for the resumption of international commercial flights after days of repairs. Extensive damage in the frenzied final days of the U.S. airlift that evacuated over 100,000 people had raised questions about how soon regular commercial service could resume. Experts from Qatar and Turkey have been racing to restore operations. \"I can clearly say that this is a historic day in the history of Afghanistan as Kabul airport is now operational,\" al-Qahtani said. \"Call it what you want, a charter or a commercial flight, everyone has tickets and boarding passes,\" he added. \"Hopefully, life is becoming normal in Afghanistan.\" The flight was the first to take off from the Kabul airport since American forces left the country at the end of August. The accompanying scenes of chaos, including Afghans plunging to their deaths from the sides of military aircraft on takeoff and a suicide bombing that killed 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members, came to define the end of Americas two-decade war. Al-Qahtani said the airports radar is now active and covering some 70 miles (112 kilometers) after U.S. forces left it inoperable. Authorities coordinated with Pakistan as they tried to fix control over the airspace, he added. Flights are restricted to daytime hours. The airport is also no longer the Hamid Karzai International Airport, but rather simply Kabul International Airport, with the name of the country\\'s former president removed. Several Taliban white flags flew from the terminal, which was emblazoned \"The Islamic Emirate seeks peaceful and positive relations with the world.\" Hundreds of other Afghans who say they are at risk for helping the Americans have gathered for more than a week in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, waiting for permission to board chartered evacuation flights. Many of them are believed not to have the necessary travel documents. Despite skepticism around the world, the Taliban have promised that Afghans who worked for the Americans will not be targeted.\\nSymptoms that persist, recur or begin a month or more after a COVID-19 infection can affect children and teens as well as adults Can kids get \"long COVID\" after coronavirus infections? Yes, but studies indicate they\\'re less likely than adults to be affected by symptoms that persist, recur or begin a month or more after infection. Estimates vary on how often the symptoms known as long COVID-19 occur in kids. A recently published U.K. study found about 4% of young children and teens had symptoms more than a month after getting infected. Fatigue, headaches and loss of smell were among the most common complaints and most were gone by two months. Coughing, chest pain and brain fog are among other long-term symptoms sometimes found in kids, and can occur even after mild infections or no initial symptoms. Some studies have found higher rates of persisting symptoms than in the U.K. study, but kids are thought to be less commonly affected than adults. About 30% of adult COVID-19 patients develop long-term symptoms, according to some estimates. Experts arent sure what causes the long-term symptoms. In some cases, it could reflect organ damage caused by the initial infection. Or it could be a result of the virus and inflammation lingering in the body. Kids can develop other rare problems after an initial coronavirus infection, including heart inflammation or a condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome. That involves fever and inflammation affecting different body parts, among other possible symptoms. Affected kids generally need to be hospitalized but most recover. A similar condition can occur in adults. The rapid spread of the highly contagious delta variant has some doctors worrying about the potential for higher numbers of children being at risk for long COVID-19 and these other conditions. Because of the potential for long-term consequences, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends follow-up doctor visits after children recover from an initial coronavirus infection. ------ The AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in this series.

Milwaukee Public Schools, the largest school district in Wisconsin, will give $100 to students who get the COVID-19 vaccine. The districts school board voted unanimously Thursday night to mandate vaccinations for staff by Nov. 1, with exceptions for religious or medical reasons. The board considered a vaccine mandate for students but ended up unanimously approving a $100 incentive for MPS students 12 and older who provide proof of vaccination by Nov. 1., including those who already got their shots. The district has about 31,205 students who are eligible for the vaccine, meaning the district could shell out as much as $3.12 million, administrators said during the meeting, the Milwaukee Sentinel Journal reported. Money from the district\\'s $500 million federal stimulus installment will be used to fund the effort. The school already has other COVID-19 safety measures in place, such as required face masks, HEPA filtration units and physical distancing. \"The COVID-19 vaccine is one of the most effective strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus,\" Superintendent Dr. Keith P. Posley said in a statement. \"We owe it to our students, teachers, staff, and community to take all possible steps to ensure safe schools.\" The districts COVID-19 dashboard reports a total of 525 cases among students and staff since July 1, with 115 students testing positive the week of Aug. 30 to Sept. 3. Over the last 14 days, there have been 448 cases among children under the age of 12 and 406 cases among 12 to 17-year-olds in Milwaukee, according to the citys dashboard. Nationwide, pediatric hospitalizations are a rising concern. Pediatric hospital admissions are at one of their highest points of the pandemic, with more than 2,355 children receiving care across the country for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections. Debates over vaccine mandates continue to unfold in school districts across the nation. On Thursday, the Los Angeles Unified School District became the first large scale system to require eligible students to get the vaccine. All students ages 12 and up will be required to be fully vaccinated by Jan. 10, 2022, unless they have a \"medical or other exemption,\" the school district said. President Joe Biden also announced that private businesses with 100 or more employees must require their employees to be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing.\\nVisiting a school, Biden said some had been \"cavalier\" with the health of kids. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited a local middle school in Washington on Friday to talk about keeping students safe in classrooms as the raging delta variant has upended the start of the school year -- and one day after Biden took his toughest tone yet and announced sweeping new federal requirements for vaccines and testing. But Biden also offered another lesson to the next generation when asked by ABC News Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott about Republican governors calling his call for vaccination mandates an \"overreach\" and threatening to sue the federal government over his new plan. \"Have at it,\" Biden said. \"I am so disappointed that particularly some Republican governors have been so cavalier with the health of these kids, so cavalier with the health of their communities,\" he said following brief remarks on keeping schools safe. \"One of the lessons I hope our students could unlearn is that politics doesn\\'t have to be this way,\" he said. \"They\\'re growing up in an environment where they see it\\'s like, like a war, like a bitter feud...It\\'s not who we are as a nation. And it\\'s not how we beat every other crisis in our history.\" Reintroducing his six-part strategy to combat the pandemic, Biden focused his remarks at Brookland Middle School on how his approach will help keep schools safe, including requiring that 300,000 educators in federal Head Start programs be vaccinated and using the Defense Production Act to produce nearly 300 million rapid COVID-19 tests for distribution at the schools around the country. He also called for more governors and school districts to implement vaccine requirements. \"We all know if schools follow the science -- like they are here -- and implement safety measures like vaccinations testing, masking, then children can be safe in schools safe from COVID-19,\" he said. Biden acknowledged the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved vaccines for children under 12, leaving a large swath of the population without the choice to be vaccinated. He said while the FDA is working on the science \"as safely and as quickly as possible,\" the onus is on children aged 12 to 17, and adults, to get the shot to keep schools open. \"The safest thing you can do for your child 12 and over is get them vaccinated,\" Biden said, speaking directly to parents. He reminded that vaccine requirements in schools are \"nothing new.\" \"You got them vaccinated for all kinds of other things -- measles, mumps, rubella -- for them to go to school, to be able to play sports, they\\'ve had to have those vaccinations,\" he added. \"It is safe, and it\\'s convenient, and we\\'ll work to bring the vaccine clinics to our schools as well.\" Praising local vaccine incentives already in play, Biden, seemingly going off script, also offered the students at Brooklyn Middle School a visit to the White House once they\\'re all vaccinated. \"I\\'m going to get in trouble with the Secret Service and everybody else. I\\'m not sure how we\\'re going to mechanically do it, but I assume the buses can get you to the White House and if we can\\'t get you all in one room. We\\'ll be out in the Rose Garden or out in the back there and maybe let you fly the helicopter,\" Biden said to laughter. \"I\\'m only joking about that.\" The first lady, who returned to teaching this week and has been an advocate for keeping kids in the classroom, speaking ahead of her husband said it was the responsibility of educators and families to make schools safe for kids. \"We owe them a promise to keep their schools open as safe as possible. We owe them a commitment to follow the science. We owe them unity, so that we can fight the virus, not each other as we move forward,\" she said. In his address to the nation on Thursday, Biden also promised to make up the salary of any teacher or administrator whose pay was withheld for opposing state bans on masks. Ahead of their remarks, the Bidens visited the classroom 6th-grade science teacher Ms. Michelle Taylor and talked with students, all of whom were masked up. The visit comes after a record-high 2,396 children were hospitalized with COVID-19 as of Tuesday. In the last week alone, nearly 252,000 children in the U.S. have tested positive for COVID-19, marking the largest increase of pediatric cases in a week since the pandemic began, according to a newly released weekly report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\\'s Hospital Association. ABC News\\' Arielle Mitropoulos contributed to this report.\\nU.S. veterans, lawmakers and others say the relaunch of evacuation flights from Kabul has done little to soothe fears that the U.S. might abandon countless Afghan allies who risked their lives working alongside American troops WASHINGTON -- Evacuation flights have resumed for Westerners, but thousands of at-risk Afghans who had helped the United States are still stranded in their homeland with the U.S. Embassy shuttered, all American diplomats and troops gone and the Taliban now in charge. With the United States and Taliban both insisting on travel documents that may no longer be possible to get in Afghanistan, the plight of those Afghans is testing President Joe Biden\\'s promises not to leave America\\'s allies behind. An evacuation flight out of Kabul on Thursday, run by the Gulf state of Qatar and the first of its kind since U.S.-led military evacuations ended Aug. 30, focused on U.S. passport and green card holders and other foreigners. For the U.S. lawmakers, veterans groups and other Americans who\\'ve been scrambling to get former U.S. military interpreters and other at-risk Afghans on charter flights out, the relaunch of evacuation flights did little to soothe fears that the U.S. might abandon countless Afghan allies. A particular worry are those whose U.S. special immigrant visas -- meant for Afghans who helped Americans during the 20-year war -- still were in the works when the Taliban took Kabul in a lightning offensive on Aug. 15. The U.S. abandoned its embassy building that same weekend. \"For all intents and purposes, these peoples chances of escaping the Taliban ended the day we left them behind,\" said Afghanistan war veteran Matt Zeller, founder of No One Left Behind. It\\'s among dozens of grassroots U.S. groups working to get out Afghan translators and others who supported Americans. An estimated 200 foreigners, including Americans, left Afghanistan on the commercial flight out of Kabul on Thursday with the cooperation of the Taliban. Ten U.S. citizens and 11 green-card holders made Thursdays flight, State Department spokesman Ned Price said. Americans organizing charter evacuation flights said they knew of more U.S. passport and green-card holders in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif and elsewhere awaiting flights out. In the U.S., National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said Thursdays flight was the result of \"careful and hard diplomacy and engagement\" and said the Taliban \"have shown flexibility, and they have been businesslike and professional in our dealings with them in this effort.\" But many doubt the Taliban will be as accommodating for Afghans who supported the U.S. In Mazar-e-Sharif, a more than weeklong standoff over charter planes at the airport there has left hundreds of people -- mostly Afghans, but some with American passports and green cards -- stranded, waiting for Taliban permission to leave. Afghans and their American supporters say the Taliban are blocking all passengers in Mazar-e-Sharif from boarding the waiting charter flights, including those with proper travel papers. Zeller pointed to the Taliban appointment this week of a hard-line government. It includes Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is on the FBIs most-wanted list with a $5 million bounty for alleged attacks and kidnappings, as interior minister, a position putting him in charge of granting passports. The Trump administration all but stopped approval of the Afghan special immigrant visas, or SIVs, in its final months. The Biden administration, too, was criticized for failing to move faster on evacuating Afghans before Kabul fell to the Taliban. The U.S. had also required some visa-seekers to go outside the country to apply, a requirement that became far more dangerous with the Taliban takeover last month. \"There are all of these major logistical obstacles,\" said Betsy Fisher of the International Refugee Assistance Project, which provides legal services to SIV applicants. \"How will people leave Afghanistan?\" She said with no clear plan in place, the U.S. government could wind up encouraging people to go on risky journeys. In July, after Biden welcomed home the first airlift, he made clear the U.S. would help even those Afghans with pending visa applications get out of Afghanistan \"so that they can wait in safety while they finish their visa applications.\" Since the military airlifts ended on Aug. 30, however, the Biden administration and Taliban have emphasized that Afghans needed passports and visas. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Thursday the administration was looking at steps like electronic visas. Hundreds of Afghans who say they are in danger of Taliban reprisals have gathered for more than a week in Mazar-e-Sharif, waiting for permission to board evacuation flights chartered by U.S. supporters. Among them was an Afghan who worked for 15 years as a U.S. military interpreter. He has been moving from hotel to hotel in Mazar-e-Sharif and running out of money as he, his eight children and his wife waited for the OK from the Taliban to leave. \"Im frightened I will be left behind,\" said the man, whose name was withheld by The Associated Press for his safety. \"I dont know what the issue is -- is it a political issue, or they dont care about us?\" The interpreter\\'s visa was approved weeks before the last U.S. troops left the country, but he could not get it stamped into his passport because the U.S. Embassy shut down. He said Thursday that he doesnt trust Taliban assurances that they will not take revenge against Afghans who worked for the Americans. Biden, already criticized for his handling of the evacuation, is being pushed by Democrats and also on both sides by Republicans, with some saying hes not doing enough to help Americas former allies and others that hes not doing enough to keep potential threats out of the U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Mike Waltz, both Republicans, said in a statement that hundreds of those at-risk Afghans and U.S. residents remain \"trapped behind enemy lines.\" The Biden administration \"must provide Congress and the American people ... with a plan to get them safely out of Afghanistan.\" The Association of War Time Allies estimates tens of thousands of special immigrant visa applicants remain in Afghanistan. An American citizen in New York is trying to get two cousins out of the country who applied for SIVs late last year and were still waiting for approval when the U.S. Embassy shut down. She said both cousins worked for a U.S. aid group for a combined eight years and are frightened the Taliban will find them. \"Theyre scared, they feel abandoned. They put their entire lives at risk, and when the U.S. was exiting, they were told they would get out,\" said the American, Fahima, whose last name and the name of the aid group are being withheld to protect her cousins. \"Where is the helping hand?\" ------ Knickmeyer reported from Oklahoma City; Watson from San Diego and Condon from New York.\\nAnimal advocates are urging Nevada state officials to call off this year\\'s annual bear hunt as wildfires continue to rage across the West. Wildlife advocates say hunting season should be canceled as the wildfire situation is so dire that bears are undergoing forced migration, potentially throwing the social dynamics of the territorial animals off balance. Several organizations penned a letter to the Nevada Department of Wildlife Wednesday following the emergence of several \"heartbreaking photographs\" showing bears either injured by the fires or searching for food and water in fire-ravaged areas. \"We need to give our bears a break,\" Patrick Donnelly, Nevada state director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. \"Climate-fueled catastrophic fire isn\\'t just hard on us, it\\'s also hard on wildlife. Bears are struggling to survive and recover from the most difficult summer of their lives, and now they\\'re going to be chased by dogs and shot to death. It\\'s unacceptable.\" The annual bear hunt in the state typically involves packs of hounds with GPS collars that chase the bear up trees. The season is scheduled to begin on Wednesday, but eight of the 10 locations where bear hunting is permitted are in regions that have burned or are still burning, or are immediately adjacent to those areas, according to the organizations. State law gives both the Nevada Department of Wildlife and the Nevada Board of Wildlife Commissioners emergency powers to stop hunting in units where an emergency has been declared. \"Our black bears are iconic animals, and at a time of dire need the fate of individual bears is just as important as the fate of the population,\" said Don Molde of the Nevada Wildlife Alliance. \"Now is not the time to add additional harassment to what they\\'ve already suffered.\" Bears in the state are also suffering from the effects of climate change, as record heat and and drought are also placing significant stress on populations. Researchers are already seeing climate change have a direct effect on mortality and reproductive failure in bears in the West, the advocates said. \"Not only should the bear hunt be suspended in fire-affected areas -- the agency and commission need to take disasters into account when setting their quotas going forward,\" said Jeff Dixon of the Humane Society of the United States. \"For wildlife policy to be science-based, wildlife management professionals need to factor in global warming\\'s impact on ecosystems when setting those policies.\" Critical fire threats were plaguing the West on Wednesday, posing the threat of new blazes to spark just as firefighters start to make significant progress in containing the existing wildfires. Red flag warnings have been posted in several regions across the Northwest Thursday due to dry heat and gusty winds, especially over parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern California, where the Dixie and Caldor fires continue to rage. Lightning from widely scattered thunderstorms expected in the Northwest could also combine with very dry fuels to ignite more fires in places like Oregon and Idaho. In addition to the heavy fire conditions, 29 cities were expected to break or tie their daily record high temperatures Thursday. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for parts of the Southwest, from Las Vegas to Phoenix and the California deserts, where temperatures were forecast to hit dangerous temperatures up to 115 degrees, or even 120 degrees in Death Valley. The heat will then shift over parts of the central Rockies on Friday. Air quality alerts are also in effect over parts of the Pacific Northwest and Rockies due to the wildfire smoke.

The fencing is just the latest security measure for a rally that has some in law enforcement on high alert. Federal law enforcement agencies have become concerned that far-right extremists, including the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys could come to Washington for the protest. The event on Saturday has been given a Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) 3 event, according to a top DHS official. A SEAR-3 event, out of five different levels is an \"event of national and/or international importance that require only limited federal support.\" The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday, warned that some individuals involved in or opposed to the Justice for J6 rally \"may seek to engage in violence but lack indications of a specific or credible plot associated with the event,\" according to a bulletin shared with state and local law enforcement and obtained by ABC News. The bulletin said the department is \"aware\" of a \"small number of recent online threats of violence referencing the planned rally, including online discussions encouraging violence the day before the rally.\" \"Lone offenders and small groups of individuals can mobilize to violence with little-to-no warning, particularly in response to confrontational encounters with perceived opponents or calls for escalation by key influencers,\" the bulletin says. \"The likely use of encrypted or closed communication platforms by those seeking to commit violence challenges law enforcement\\'s ability to identify and disrupt potential plotting.\" In one instance, the bulletin says that in early September some social media users \"discussed storming the US Capitol on the night before the rally, and one user commented on kidnapping an identified member of Congress.\" Melissa Smislova, the deputy under secretary for intelligence and enterprise readiness, told attendees at the Homeland Security Enterprise Forum on Tuesday that the department expects 700 people to be in Washington for the event. Top DHS officials, including Homeland security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, have said they\\'ve stepped up their communications with state and local partners. Information sharing is key to avoiding another incident like Jan. 6, Mayorkas told reporters last week and as a result, DHS has increased information sharing efforts throughout the country. The leading agency for the event is the U.S. Capitol Police. \"We are closely monitoring Sept. 18 and we are planning accordingly,\" said Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger. \"After Jan. 6, we made department-wide changes to the way we gather and share intelligence internally and externally. I am confident the work we are doing now will make sure our officers have what they need to keep everyone safe.\" Capitol Police has asked the Department of Defense \"for the ability to receive National Guard support should the need arise on September 18,\" according to a statement by the department. A Defense Department official said Wednesday Pentagon staffers have discussed the requirements for support with the Capitol Police and are determining a course of action. Every available Capitol Police officer will be working and the Washington Metropolitan Police Department said they are also \"fully prepared\" for the protest. \"As with all First Amendment demonstrations, MPD will be monitoring and assessing the activities and planning accordingly with our federal law enforcement partners,\" an MPD spokesperson said in a statement to ABC News. \"MPD will have an increased presence around the city where demonstrations will be taking place and will be prepared to make street closures for public safety.\" Additionally, the FBI Washington Field Office said they are working closely with state local and federal partners. Javed Ali, a former national counterterrorism director on the National Security Council said agencies do have cause for concern. \"While the government has not yet issued threat bulletins about specific and credible plots on that day, like 6 January there may be people who attend in a highly agitated mindset and then switch quickly to violent action with little-to-no warning,\" Ali said. ABC News\\' Matt Seyler contributed to this report.\\nWith millions of Americans still unvaccinated, hospitals across the country are once again facing the overwhelming pressure of caring for thousands of COVID-19 patients -- with more than 100,000 people in beds as of Friday. While hospitalization rates in states like Florida and Mississippi, hit hard early in the delta surge, are beginning to decline, other southern states, including Kentucky, are showing no signs of infection and hospitalization rates slowing down. \"We walk into the hospital and it feels like the world is on fire,\" Dr. Karan Singh, a pulmonologist at Med Center Health in Bowling Green, Kentucky, told ABC News. Statewide, there are more than 2,600 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 -- the highest on record, and currently, just 7% of intensive care beds remain available. At the state\\'s previous peak last December, there were 1,000 fewer patients hospitalized. Last week, Kentucky reported more than 30,000 new cases, according to Gov. Andy Beshear, a weekly record since the onset of the pandemic. \"Our hospital situation has never been more dire in my lifetime than it is right now,\" Beshear said. \"We cannot handle more sick individuals.\" More than 400 members of the Kentucky National Guard, as well as strike teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency\\'s emergency medical services, have now been deployed to help struggling hospitals across the state. \"I would honestly say it\\'s at least three times worse than what it was the first time,\" nurse Kerri Eklund, from Baptist Health Hardin, in Elizabethtown, told ABC News. \"We\\'re seeing a lot of people getting really sick. There are patients that will come in and they\\'ll be doing okay for a few days and then, in the blink of an eye, they go downhill.\" The current wave of infections caught many health care workers by surprise, added Heather Brock, another nurse at Baptist Health Hardin. Earlier this year, with vaccinations available, there was a sense that things would return to normal. However, nearly nine months into the country\\'s vaccination rollout, and less than 50% of Kentucky\\'s total population has been fully vaccinated. \"I wasn\\'t expecting this much of a surge again. In my opinion, it\\'s worse than the previous ones,\" Brock said. Front-line health workers said that the situation escalated quickly, after a short period of relief earlier this summer, and nearly all patients have been unvaccinated. Across Kentucky, state data shows that 91.6% of COVID-19 related hospitalizations between March 1, and Aug. 31, have been among partially or unvaccinated residents. \"The patients who are vaccinated are doing a lot better,\" said Eklund. In fact, \"patients who are vaccinated, most of the time don\\'t even need oxygen, and they\\'re just here because they have a few of the other complications and they\\'re monitored. Most of the patients who end up going downhill, unfortunately, have not been vaccinated.\" Many patients the teams are treating remain in the intensive care unit for weeks at a time, said Baptist Health Hardin nurse Clara Robertson, while \"suffering and struggling for breath, that entire time. And then a lot of times, unfortunately, losing that battle, and dying.\" The states most recent wave has been a difficult reality to face, added Eklund, as well as emotionally crushing for the medical staff to watch so many patients suffer. The patients, \"have been doing all they can and trying their hardest, and then they just get to the point that their body can\\'t handle it anymore. And I think their minds start to break, because they\\'ve been giving it all and they\\'re still not getting any better.\" Medical professionals, whether doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants or respiratory therapists -- all are stretched so thin that many are experiencing exhaustion, compassion fatigue and burnout. \"We\\'re being tasked with daunting assignments, and everyone is emotionally, physically and mentally exhausted,\" noted Brian Deweese, a respiratory therapist at Med Center Health. The fatigue is such, he said, that \"we are seeing highly experienced and exceptional health care workers walk away from their profession altogether, because of the stress and anxiety they\\'re having to deal with.\" Outside the walls of the hospital, Singh said many community members do not fully realize the severity of the COVID-19 crisis across the state. \"When we leave, and we go to the grocery store, or we talk to people not in medicine, it\\'s like the world is just unaware of what is happening,\" Singh said. And front-line workers say they worry this surge will only further deteriorate, as they prepare for fall and winter. \"I\\'m really worried that it\\'s just going to keep getting worse, and I hope that we\\'re able to find a way to protect everyone, and have what we need, because we all know that winter is the worst time for health issues all together,\" said Eklund. \"I\\'m really hoping that we\\'re not going to have to see a lot of lives lost.\\n\"We were one second away from a Columbine here,\" the local sheriff said. Two Florida middle schoolers with an apparent interest in the Columbine High School massacre were allegedly plotting to carry out a school shooting of their own until a teacher was tipped off about a possible concealed weapon, authorities said. The teacher at Harns Marsh Middle School in Lehigh Acres, near Fort Myers, alerted school administrators and a school resource officer about the tip from students Wednesday, authorities said. A search of an eighth grader\\'s backpack did not turn up a gun, but administrators allegedly found a map that \"contains markings indicating the location of each of the school\\'s interior cameras,\" Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said during a press briefing Thursday afternoon. An investigation by the office\\'s youth services criminal investigations division ultimately identified two students -- a 13-year-old and a 14-year-old -- \"involved in a plot to carry out a school shooting,\" Marceno said. The pair were \"extensively studying\" the 1999 Columbine High School shooting -- in which two teens killed 13 people -- and attempting to learn how to construct pipe bombs, the sheriff said. Searches of their homes allegedly found \"disturbing evidence, including a gun and several knives,\" he said. \"This could have turned disastrous,\" Marceno said. \"We were one second away from a Columbine here.\" The sheriff also likened the foiled plot to the \"next Parkland massacre\" -- the 2018 school shooting in which a teen fatally shot 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida. \"But we stopped them in the planning stages,\" he said. The two students, who were both known to authorities as deputies had visited their homes nearly 80 times combined, will be charged with conspiracy to commit a mass shooting, according to the sheriff. Lee County Superintendent Ken Savage commended the students who came forward to report the potential threat, the teacher who alerted administrators after receiving the tip and the \"quick action by our staff.\" \"Students were safe at all times,\" Savage told reporters, noting that the classroom was emptied while administrators investigated the threat. \"All the threat assessment and emergency response training made a difference in the outcome of this incident.\" Both teenagers met the criteria for an evaluation at a mental health facility, and investigators will be looking into a risk protection order, which restricts firearm and ammunition access for those who pose a danger to themselves or others, Marceno said. Authorities identified the students at the press briefing Thursday, but ABC News is not naming them because they are minors and had yet to be charged.\\nFor girls and young women accustomed to mountain climbing and physical fitness training six times a week, being confined in a crowded wedding hall near an airport in northern Afghanistan is a different kind of challenge -- one with their very fates at stake. It\\'s the new reality for dozens of them affiliated with Ascend, an organization that teaches Afghan women and girls athletic-based leadership skills. They came to the airport in Mazar-e-Sharif 10 days ago for evacuation flights the Taliban have blocked, heightening their fears they\\'ll be left behind. \"We\\'re trying to remind them we haven\\'t forgotten you. The world hasn\\'t forgotten you,\" Marina LeGree, founder and executive director of Ascend told ABC News. \"But some of them are losing hope.\" While the first passenger flight out of Kabul since the Taliban seized power took off on Thursday, carrying some U.S. citizens and other Westerners on board, life-and-death concerns loom for at-risk Afghans still in the country, especially for women like those of Ascend who have exercised independence in the last 20 years, free from Taliban rule. Founded in 2014, Ascend is a U.S.-based nonprofit operating in Afghanistan that recruits a new group of Afghan girls and young women aged 15-24 each year to embark on a two-year mountaineering program. The recruits -- who have trained in Ghaza Stadium, used by the last Taliban government for public punishment -- have a mission of fostering leadership, volunteerism, and physical and mental well-being for the next generation. But if the group in Mazar-e-Sharif is left behind, LeGree fears they\\'ll be married off to Taliban fighters -- or worse. Standoff at Mazar-e-Sharif For over a week now, the Taliban have not permitted at least six chartered flights to leave from Mazar-e-Sharif International Airport in northern Afghanistan, saying some evacuees do not have the proper documents to depart. The standoff is turning dire for some passengers, including the women of Ascend. LeGree, speaking to ABC News from Naples where she\\'s trying to get the State Department and others to help, said her group traveled from Kabul without their families with the understanding they\\'d be evacuated days ago. They\\'ve recounted to her since how the bathrooms are getting \"disgusting\" and it\\'s difficult to sleep. \"I\\'ve got teenage girls separated from their families in this kind of environment with the Taliban and men all over the place. It\\'s uncontrolled, and it\\'s not comfortable at all,\" she said. Many women affiliated with Ascend were born before or were too young to remember the last time the Taliban ruled in Afghanistan -- when women were barred from attending school, forced to wear all-encompassing burqas and be accompanied by a male relative whenever they went outside. Accustomed to their independence, with 80% of Ascend graduates going on to higher education, they fear for their future under the Taliban\\'s new \"caretaker government -- which, so far, includes no women in power. LeGree blamed the U.S. for promising to evacuate at-risk Afghans but missing out on \"precious time\" as the Taliban has gotten more organized. \"This is a whole bunch of women at risk about to be left to the slaughter if we can\\'t do something -- I\\'m horrified that my government had such a weak response,\" LeGree said. \"We\\'ve given you all the details of these people and you cleared them and call them to come, and now you\\'re saying, \\'You have to have travel documents and don\\'t worry if you do, you get to go\\'? That\\'s a complete abdication of responsibility, and it\\'s just -- it\\'s morally repugnant,\" she added. There are at least 1,000 people trying to fly out of Mazar-e-Sherif on these chartered flights, she said, including at least 19 U.S. citizens and two green card holders. She\\'s been told the Taliban have come inside the holding facility several times and taken people out, but those she\\'s in contact with aren\\'t sure why. So for now, they wait. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday the Biden administration was doing all it can to get the planes off the ground, including engaging in private talks with the Taliban through special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the new U.S. mission in Doha. \"The United States has pulled every lever available to us to facilitate the departure of these chartered flights from Mazar. The chartered flights, of course, have not taken off from Mazar -- I can tell you that has nothing to do with any inaction or action by the part of the United States government, and we were clear that we want to see the Taliban permit those who have expressed a desire to leave in this way to do so,\" he said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said Wednesday the charter flights in Mazar-e-Sharif \"need to move\" but that there are \"limits\" to what the U.S. can accomplish without personnel on the ground and without an airport under their control. He said it was his understanding the Taliban have objected to flights that combine passengers who have valid travel documents and those who do not. LeGree said that\\'s not sufficient. \"It was really hard day for me watching what Blinken said, because my hopes were high, because he was in Doha, that it would be easy for him to press upon the Qatari is to press upon the Taliban to just let us go -- and it didn\\'t happen,\" she said. While Ascend has successfully seen the evacuations of 56 staffers and Afghans, LeGree said it will be hard to sleep until all 88 who asked to be evacuated are out. Despite the hardship, Ascend plans to continue operating in some capacity when the situation in Afghanistan calms down. There are still some 150 women and alumni affiliated with the program who are staying behind and have expressed hope in continuing their mission. Ascend moved into a new facility this year, and LeGree paid the landlord rent on Wednesday as he holds the building for them, though she isn\\'t sure if she, herself, will be able to return to the country she also loves. \"Don\\'t assume that we\\'re closing up the shop. It\\'s quite the opposite,\" LeGree said. \"We need to keep the light shining on Afghan girls and women. Taliban have bullied their way into power now, but they have to govern. Let\\'s be in there with them.\" US women hike in support When Jahna Cook and Danielle Jefko of Madison, Wisconsin, learned that Ascend had women still stuck in Afghanistan hoping to evacuate, they felt a calling to get involved from the U.S. \"Their stories pulled on our hearts and hit home for us because we\\'re women, we\\'re moms and we climb together,\" Cook said. \"The freedom and accomplishment and leadership these girls so clearly have on the mountain was so relatable, and to see them facing the crisis at hand, we knew we had to do something.\" Inspired by an annual 50K race Ascend puts on in the U.K., Cook and Jefko made plans for a sister 50K, before moving the race up by two weeks as the chartered planes carrying Ascend members remained grounded. The women taped up photos of the girls along their route, she said, to keep their intent at top of mind. The two are continuing to encourage others to donate to Ascend\\'s resettlement fund or call their elected representatives. \"We want to make sure people know this is not a closed issue,\" Cook said. \"There are still people there that desperately need our help.\" ABC News\\' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.\\n\"I knew if he got me on the floor, I would be dead,\" Nikkita Brown said. A Black woman said she was walking out of a closed park in Chicago, adhering to police instructions, when a white police officer attempted to tackle her, allegedly unprovoked. On Aug. 28, Nikkita Brown said the officer drove up to her as she was walking her dog in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago and told her to leave the area immediately. Brown agreed, but the officer insisted on driving behind her as she walked out of the park, and eventually got out of his vehicle to follow her on foot, she told ABC News in an exclusive interview airing Thursday on \"Good Morning America.\" Brown said she consistently told him, \"I am leaving\" and \"I am walking away,\" as she actively walked toward the exit. The officer got out of his car and told her, \"You can go to jail,\" according to a video taken by Brown who recorded part of the encounter. Brown said he also allegedly told her she would never see her dog again. Brown said she took her cell phone out to record the altercation and call for help. \"Even if somebody didn\\'t answer,\" she said, she wanted to \"at least leave a voicemail and say, \\'if you call me in the morning and you don\\'t reach me, I\\'m in jail, or worse.\\'\" The unmasked officer continued to approach Brown, ignoring her request to stay 6 feet away, videos show. In one clip, the officer can be heard saying, \"I don\\'t need a mask on, I\\'m outside,\" shortly before attempting to tackle Brown, appearing to restrain her by kicking her legs and knocking her phone out of her hands. After a 2-minute-long physical altercation during which Brown remained on her feet and screamed for help, Brown and the officer separated and both left the scene without the officer making an arrest. \"I knew if he got me on the floor, I would be dead,\" Brown told ABC News. According to the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA), the group inquiring into the incident, the investigation is ongoing. \"We have a responsibility to investigate allegations of police misconduct and determine if they are well founded based on the facts and evidence of each case,\" interim COPA chief Andrea Kersten said in a statement. \"If violations did occur, COPA will hold the officer accountable.\" COPA is not a part of the Chicago Police Department, according to its website. COPA is a completely independent agency within the City of Chicago responsible for the intake of all complaints regarding allegations of misconduct by CPD members and the investigation of such allegations. COPA is staffed by civilian investigators and headed by a civilian Chief Administrator who is appointed to a four-year term. A Chicago Police Department spokesperson told ABC News that \"the officer in question has been placed on desk duty as the COPA investigates the video.\" Brown said there were others in the area that night, and she felt profiled because of her race. \"I walked past four kids that were behind me... white males. As soon as I saw the car pull up, I looked behind me to see if he said anything to the kids. He didn\\'t,\" Brown said. At a press conference on Aug. 30, the CPD Superintendent David O. Brown said the investigation into the incident was opened in the Bureau of Internal Affairs and had since been transferred to the COPA. If COPA determines that the officer violated a policy, a disciplinary recommendation will be forwarded to David O. Brown, at which point he is given the choice to agree or disagree with COPA\\'s recommendation, the superintendent said during the press conference. If he disagrees with COPA, the incident goes to the Chicago Police Board for adjudication. The officer has not been identified yet due to privacy reasons, a COPA spokesperson said. Brown\\'s attorney, Keenan Saulter, is requesting the identity of the officer be released in order to file a formal complaint against him. \"There were other individuals in the park that night. So we still have to come back around to the question of \\'why her?\\'\" Saulter said. \"The worst scenario would have been that he writes her a ticket for being in the park after 11:00 p.m.\" The officer has allegedly been involved in previous cases of racial profiling, Saulter said, and should be fired from the force. Now, Brown said she feels anxious leaving the house. \"If anything, I should feel even more protected by a police presence as a single woman walking at night, not be fearful that I\\'m going to die at the hands of an officer,\" Brown said.\\nBride and groom dive into the ocean in wedding outfits A bride and groom raised eyebrows taking the plunge into the ocean in their full wedding outfits.\\nStubborn snake snagged from inside wall A particularly stubborn python hiding inside the wall of a home in Queensland gave this snake catcher some trouble before it was safely removed.\\nIn a victory for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an appeals court ruled Friday to keep the state\\'s ban on student mask mandates in place, at least until it issues a final ruling on the legality of the ban. The ban on mask requirements -- issued by the Florida Department of Health in August after DeSantis directed it to \"protect parents\\' freedom to choose whether their children wear masks\" -- had been suspended Wednesday by a judge in Tallahassee. Judge John C. Cooper had ruled that the state could not keep punishing school districts that require masks while the appeals court works toward a final ruling. Friday\\'s order overrides Cooper, giving the Florida Board of Education the green light to continue withholding the salaries of school board members in districts that require face coverings for students. The state has imposed that punishment on two districts and has announced investigations into several others. \"Just like last year in the school re-opening litigation, the First District Court of Appeal has reinstated Florida\\'s ability to protect the freedom for parents to make the best decisions for their children while they make their own ruling on the appeal,\" Taryn Fenske, communications director for DeSantis, said in a statement to ABC News. \"We look forward to winning the appeal and will continue to fight for parents\\' rights.\" DeSantis tweeted, \"No surprise here - the 1st DCA has restored the right of parents to make the best decisions for their children. I will continue to fight for parents\\' rights.\" Alachua County, one of the districts where school board members\\' salaries are being withheld for imposing a mandate, said in a statement that despite Friday\\'s ruling it will \"continue to enforce universal masking in our schools.\" \"The decision is disappointing, but we understood from the beginning that the legal battle over masks in schools would take time and not every decision would be favorable,\" Alachua County Public Schools Superintendent Carlee Simon said in a statement. \"While Alachua County Public Schools is not part of this particular lawsuit, we certainly support it,\" Simon continued. \"We are pleased that the plaintiffs plan to continue their fight. In the meantime, our legal challenges are just beginning, and we support the other Florida districts and families who are also taking the state to court over this issue.\" At least 13 school districts, including Florida\\'s six largest, have implemented mask mandates. \"Upon our review of the trial court\\'s final judgment and the operative pleadings, we have serious doubts about standing, jurisdiction, and other threshold matters,\" Friday\\'s order states. \"These doubts significantly militate against the likelihood of the appellees\\' ultimate success in this appeal.\" A lawyer representing the parents who sued the state said Friday\\'s decision would make students less safe. \"We are disappointed by the ruling of the 1st DCA that reinstates the stay and will be seeking pass through jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Florida since this matter involves statewide issues. With a stay in place, students, parents and teachers are back in harm\\'s way,\" Charles Gallagher, one of the lawyers representing the group of parents who sued the state over its ban on mask mandates, wrote on Twitter. The U.S. Department of Department said Friday evening it had opened a civil rights investigation into Florida. The Office of Civil Rights \"is concerned that Florida\\'s policy requiring public schools and school districts to allow parents to opt their children out of mask mandates may be preventing schools in Florida from meeting their legal obligations not to discriminate based on disability and from providing an equal educational opportunity to students with disabilities who are at heightened risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\" Florida joins Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah under federal scrutiny. ABC News\\' Anne Flaherty contributed to this report. Dave Packer reports for ABC News Radio:\\nLos Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer will miss the rest of the season. Major League Baseball and the players\\' association extended his administrative leave through the end of the World Series on Friday. Bauer was placed on seven days paid leave July 2 under the joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy adopted by MLB and the players union after a Southern California woman said he choked her into unconsciousness, punched her repeatedly and had anal sex with her without her consent during two sexual encounters earlier this year. MLB and the union have since agreed to several extensions. The decision to extend the leave through the rest of the season had been expected, given that Bauer had not pitched since June 29 and was running out of time to get back in shape to return to the mound while games remained. The regular season is scheduled to end Oct. 3 and the minimum ramp-up time for pitchers is generally regarded as three weeks. Bauer now awaits the next steps in the legal case. The Pasadena Police Department last week delivered the results of their three-month investigation into the woman\\'s allegations to the Los Angeles County district attorneys office and the case is under review. Judge Dianna Gould-Saltman of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County denied the 27-year-old San Diego womans request for a restraining order against Bauer. Bauer has said through representatives that everything that happened between the two was \"wholly consensual\" in the nights they spent together in April and May at his Pasadena home. The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault. Earlier this year, after winning his first Cy Young with the Cincinnati Reds last season, Bauer agreed to a $102 million, three-year contract to join his hometown Dodgers. ------ More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports\\nHours before the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, pretrial proceedings in the case against the five accused orchestrators started and ended on Friday with none of them present in the courtroom for the final public session of the week - while multiple defense teams raised formal objections against the judge continuing to preside over the military commission. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the attacks, had been present during public sessions of the proceedings on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, even taking the rare moment out of his detention cell to wave at reporters in the public gallery in the courtroom. But he and his co-defendants surprised reporters Friday by skipping the final public portion of the commission before the world recognizes the solemn commemoration on Saturday. An assistant staff judge advocate, identified only by a pseudonym \"Pa,\" testified to their absence and provided signatures acknowledging their \"voluntary\" decision not to attend. James Connell, defense counsel for Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, aka Ammar al-Baluchi, attempted to have the military witness identify himself, but the government objected, insisting the testimony should proceed anonymously and was within the regulations of the military commission and not a violation of the Sixth Amendment. Connells complaint was less about identifying this particular witness on the record, and more about expressing his continuing objection to the governments use of unnamed witnesses. The interaction illustrated not only the tedious nature of the pretrial proceedings where nearly every action warrants deliberation, but it also revealed another unusual aspect of this case: the defense does not have access to their own clients -- even when the court is in session - unless the accused actually attend the hearings. The assistant staff judge advocate testified that one 9/11 defendant, Ammar al-Baluchi was sleepy and chose to nap rather than attend Friday\\'s public session. No explanation was given for the absence of the other four defendants, though Connell was able to extract details that the condition worsened of another Gitmo detainee, Abdul Hadi al-Iraqi -- who is charged in another case but shares communal living quarters with some of the 9/11 defendants. Al-Iraqi now claims that he is paralyzed and has lost the function of his legs, so al-Baluchi apparently aided him throughout the past several nights after the detainees rejected the assistance of a female corpsman. (His lawyers say that her initial offer was an invasive exam as the reason al-Iraqi waved off care.) The assistant staff judge advocate rejected the claim that Al-Iraqi is paralyzed. Col. Matt McCall, presiding over the proceedings, offered to make a change to the schedule to allow the defendants more time to sleep Friday morning and attend today\\'s proceedings in the afternoon, but the defense counsel ultimately refused the accommodation - rather than face the prospect that the codefendants would be dragged out of their cells and forced to attend in person. After discussing the judges qualifications at length this week, Mohammed\\'s lawyer Gary Sowards surprised many in the courtroom by announcing he would seek to disqualify McCall from sitting on the bench, saying there is a reasonable question about the judges impartiality, given the \"extra-judicial\" nature of McCall\\'s removal from the case after he was initially assigned. (Sowards argues the decision was made without appropriate litigation and at the behest of the Pentagon.) A second chief counsel argued not for McCalls removal from the case, but that he needed more time to read in on the case at hand and capital law. \"You\\'re not familiar with the record,\" defense counsel Cheryl T. Bormann told the judge. \"You are not familiar with the law as it applies to capital cases. Being a judge in a trial courtroom requires you to rule spontaneously on objections.\" A third lead attorney echoed both Sowards and Bormann. Connell declared he had no objections with McCall and would not seek to disqualify him. The final team deferred for now. McCall said he would consider the arguments and render a decision on his own position. The teams then moved into arguing over discovery, one of the most contentious issues in this case. The defense teams argued in favor of a motion demanding the government turn over more detailed evidence from the CIA black sites where KSM and the other detainees were held. After pointing out that the government provided limited assessments of more than 800 interrogation sessions, the defense further pressed the government\\'s secrecy. In step with this line of questioning, Connell also revealed to reporters after the session that he could now share that the prosecution had withheld evidence linking an FBI interrogator that was part of the so-called \"clean team\" that questioning the detainees after they arrived at Guantanamo and the CIA black site program, providing fresh scrutiny surrounding the 2008 testimony from the detainees that the government is expect to build much of its case upon. This slow drip of information and lack of transparency creates a significant hurdle for each defense team, they argue. \"We don\\'t know what we don\\'t know,\" Corey Krzan, one of Ramzi bin al-Shibhs lawyers, said before the judge. After about three and a half hours of public session, the court recessed for lunch and a classified session. The public portion of the proceedings will resume on Monday.\\nPresident Joe Biden spoke with Chinas Xi Jinping on Thursday amid growing frustration on the American side that high-level engagement between the two leaders top advisers has been largely unfruitful in the early going of the Biden presidency WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden spoke with China\\'s Xi Jinping on Thursday amid growing frustration on the American side that high-level engagement between the two leaders\\' top advisers has been largely unfruitful in the early going of the Biden presidency. Biden initiated the call with Xi, the second between the two leaders since Biden took office. It comes at a moment when there is no shortage of thorny issues between the two nations, including cybersecurity breaches originating from China, Beijing\\'s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and what the White House has labeled as \"coercive and unfair\" trade practices by the Chinese. But Biden\\'s aim with the 90-minute call was less focused on any of those hot-button issues and instead centered on discussing the way ahead for the U.S.-China relationship after it got off to a decidedly rocky start in his tenure. The White House said in a statement the \"two leaders had a broad, strategic discussion in which they discussed areas where our interests converge, and areas where our interests, values, and perspectives diverge.\" The White House is hopeful the two sides can work together on issues of mutual concern --including climate change and preventing a nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula -- despite growing differences. Beijing, however, has pushed back against U.S. pressure and increasingly has suggested it could remain broadly uncooperative until Biden dials down criticism on what it deems Chinese internal matters. Xi in the call appeared to echo some of the complaints, telling Biden that U.S. government policy toward China caused \"serious difficulties\" in relations, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. \"This is not in the basic interests of the two peoples,\" the Chinese leader said, according to Xinhua. \"Chinese-U.S. confrontation will bring disaster to both countries and the world,\" Xi added. Xi said the two sides should cooperate on climate change, epidemic prevention, economic recovery and other issues, Xinhua reported. Ahead of the call, a senior administration official said the White House has been unsatisfied with early engagements with the Chinese. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said White House officials were hopeful that Xi hearing directly from Biden could prove beneficial. The White House official said Biden made clear to Xi that he had no intention of moving away from his administrations policy of pressing China on human rights, trade and other areas where it believes China is acting outside international norms. High-level engagement in the early going has been most notable for each side blasting the other with recriminations. Last week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned Biden climate envoy John Kerry that deteriorating U.S.-China relations could undermine cooperation on climate change. Wang told Kerry, who was visiting Tianjin for climate talks with his Chinese counterparts, by video link that such cooperation cannot be separated from the broader relationship and called on the U.S. to take steps to improve ties, according to the Foreign Ministry. In July, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman faced a long list of demands and complaints, including accusations that the U.S. was trying to contain and suppress Chinas development. Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng urged the U.S. \"to change its highly misguided mindset and dangerous policy.\" In March, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan had heated exchanges with Chinese Communist Party foreign affairs chief Yang Jiechi when they met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage. At that meeting, Yang accused the U.S. of failing to deal with its own human rights problems and took issue with what he said was American hypocrisy. Administration officials suspect that some of the rhetoric in those high-profile meetings was more about playing to a domestic audience through the press than sending a message to the White House. With that in mind, Biden highlighted the importance of two leaders ability to have private conversations and be clear about their priorities, the administration official said. Biden from the start of his presidency has sought to put greater focus on China, rallying allies to speak in a more unified voice about Beijings human rights record, its trade practices and its militarys increasingly assertive behavior that has unnerved U.S. allies in the Pacific. He sees Beijing as the most significant economic competitor to the United States and a growing national security concern. But the president has also expressed hope that his long-running working relationship with Xi, one that dates back to when he served as Barack Obamas vice president, could pay dividends in the two nations cooperating on certain critical issues. The two spent time on the call reminiscing about their time traveling together when they were both vice presidents, the administration official said. The White House said the leaders during the call agreed to engage \"openly and straightforwardly\" on issues where the nations are at odds and where there is agreement. -- McDonald reported from Beijing.\\nEven after two decades, the work to rebuild the World Trade Center complex after its destruction in the Sept. 11 attacks is still incomplete NEW YORK -- Two decades after its destruction in the Sept. 11 attacks, the work to rebuild the World Trade Center complex remains incomplete. Two planned skyscrapers, a performing arts center and a church are still unfinished at the site, which plays host Saturday to the annual ceremony honoring nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks. Visitors to the commemoration will find a place that no longer has the feel of a construction zone, though, even as the work continues. The memorial plaza with its twin reflecting pools opened in 2011. One World Trade Center -- the spire originally known as the Freedom Tower -- opened in 2014, as did the National Sept. 11 Memorial and Museum. An underground transit hub and shopping mall opened in 2016. Three other glassy towers built to replace those lost in the attack are open. Cranes and construction fences, however, can still be seen around the site. Here is a look at the unfinished work: 2 WORLD TRADE CENTER Planned as the second tallest skyscraper at the site, 2 World Trade Center, might someday reach 80 stories. But for now, just a low stump of a building exists as a placeholder, covered with colorful graffiti-style murals at the northeast corner of the Trade Center site. Developer Larry Silverstein has said he wants to sign an anchor tenant for the tower before starting construction. Despite the coronavirus pandemic emptying out office buildings, the now-90-year-old says he is confident a tenant will be found so the Norman Foster -designed tower can be built in his lifetime. \"At the end of the day, my goal is to put the shovel in the ground as soon as possible, and complete the rebuilding project we started 20 years ago,\" Silverstein said in an emailed statement. PERFORMING ARTS CENTER After years of delays, the Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center is under construction just to the west of 2 World Trade Center\\'s future site and is scheduled to open in 2023. While a performance center was part of World Trade Center master planner Daniel Libeskind\\'s original scheme, disputes over its budget and design threatened its viability in the years after Frank Gehry and the Norwegian firm Snohetta were tapped to design it in 2004. In 2015, the center\\'s leaders announced a new team of architects, Joshua Ramus of Rex Architecture P.C. plus the firm Davis Brody Bond, who have designed a translucent glass and marble cube. Once finished, the arts center\\'s top floor will house a flexible set of spaces that can be configured into one, two or three theaters for drama, dance, film and music. Free performances will take place on a small stage on the lobby level. \"All of the components are automated, so the walls move, the floor and the seats move,\" said the centers president, Leslie Koch. Perelman, the banker and investor, secured naming rights with a $75 million donation. Besides that gift, the $500 million center is being built with private donations and $100 million from the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., the agency created after the attacks to spur redevelopment. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is the chair of the board and a donor. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH The long-delayed construction of the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine, replacing the only house of worship destroyed in the attacks, is now proceeding briskly after years of delays. The building, designed by architect Santiago Calatrava, is going up near the southeast corner of ground zero and will look down on the memorial plaza from a perch atop another building that holds the entrance to the World Trade Center\\'s underground garage. Slated for completion next year, the church is surrounded by a small public park and features a Byzantine-style dome and marble cladding that can be lit from within. The project was first delayed by a dispute over location between the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center. Then, project costs soared and construction halted in late 2017 after the archdiocese fell behind on payments. A new entity, Friends of St. Nicholas, led by a core of wealthy Greek Americans, assumed management on behalf of the archdiocese and raised the remaining funds. Construction resumed in August 2020, with final cost estimates of close to $85 million. The archdiocese plans a lighting ceremony on Sept. 10 at the unfinished building. 5 WORLD TRADE CENTER Construction has yet to begin on the tower that will replace an office building, occupied by Deutsche Bank, that was was damaged and contaminated by debris from the collapsing twin towers. The original building was demolished between 2007 and 2011 -- a job that came with its own tragedy. Two firefighters died in the building during a 2007 fire. The LMDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in recent years chose a partnership led by Brookfield Properties and Silverstein Properties to develop the now-cleared land as a 900-foot (270-meter) tower with office and retail space in addition to 1,325 apartments. \"We expect if everything goes according to plan that that building should be complete within about five years,\" said Silverstein Properties\\' marketing executive Dara McQuillan. Plans call for 25% of the apartments to be designated as affordable and rented at below-market rates. But some neighborhood residents say that isn\\'t good enough. They would like all of the apartments to be affordable. \"The universal demand was always that there be affordable housing,\" said Todd Fine, a lower Manhattan preservation advocate. Fine called 330 below-market-rate apartments \"very minimal.\" ------ Associated Press journalist Peter Smith contributed to this report. ------ For more AP coverage of the 9/11 anniversary from New York and around the globe, visit our hub at https://apnews.com/hub/9-11-a-world-changed.\\nThe state of Alabama has asked to dismiss its lawsuit challenging a controversial statistical method used by the U.S. Census Bureau The state of Alabama on Thursday asked to dismiss its lawsuit challenging the U.S. Census Bureau\\'s use of a controversial statistical method aimed at keeping peoples data private in the numbers used for redrawing congressional and legislative districts. Alabama and three Alabama politicians had sued the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, in an effort to stop the statistical agency from using the method known as \"differential privacy.\" They also wanted to force the bureau to release the redistricting numbers earlier than planned. Normally, the data are released at the end of March, but the Census Bureau pushed the deadline to August because of delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic. A three-judge panel agreed to dismiss the lawsuit late Thursday. Alabama originally claimed the delay was caused by the bureaus attempt to implement differential privacy, which the states attorneys said would result in inaccurate redistricting numbers. A three-judge panel in June refused to stop the Census Bureau from using the statistical method. In July, Alabama and the Commerce Department asked that the lawsuit be put on hold so that the state could decide how to proceed after the redistricting data was released in mid-August. \"While we continue to believe that the Census Bureaus production of intentionally skewed redistricting data half a year late was unlawful, dismissing the lawsuit now is in the states best interest to allow the Legislature to focus on redistricting based on the data it finally received,\" Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said Thursday in a statement. Differential privacy adds intentional errors to the data to obscure the identity of any given participant in the 2020 census while still providing statistically valid information. The Census Bureau says more privacy protections are needed than in past decades as technological innovations magnify the threat of people being identified through their census answers, which are confidential by law. Two actions by the Census Bureau also alleviated some of the Alabama officials\\' concerns. First, the statistical agency released the data in August, instead of September as previously planned. Then, it reduced the amount of error injected into the data, Marshall said. \"Again, while not perfect, the resulting data Alabama received appears to be more accurate than it likely would have been had Alabama not drawn attention to the Bureaus plans,\" Marshall said. \"Given these positive developments and the need to timely complete redistricting, dismissing the lawsuit at this stage makes sense.\" ------\\nAn offshoot of the Republican Attorneys General Association held a special meeting weeks before the election to discuss its strategies if then-President Donald Trump lost TOPEKA, Kan. -- An offshoot of the Republican Attorneys General Association that sent a robocall urging \"patriots\" to support then-President Donald Trump at the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the storming of the U.S. Capitol held a special \"war games\" meeting weeks before the election to discuss its strategies if Trump lost. The two-day conference in September 2020 was among more than 20 meetings that the Rule of Law Defense Fund held in the four months before the November election for senior aides to Republicans who were their states\\' chief law enforcement officials. But unlike the others, it was held in-person despite coronavirus cases surging and the vaccine still months from coming to market, and the group paid attendees\\' travel costs. The Defense Fund, which is a branch of the Republican Attorneys General Association, gained notoriety for its robocall the day before the Jan. 6 insurrection, when pro-Trump demonstrators stormed the Capitol in an attempt to thwart the certification of Joe Biden\\'s victory. Emails from the offices of the Republican attorneys general in Kansas and Missouri show that the Defense Fund held weekly calls for senior staffers in state offices, a \"virtual roundtable\" with senior corporate attorneys in July and the in-person summit in September. It also held a Zoom \"strategy session\" eight days after the election and a Dec. 1 call to discuss immigration policy. A Sept. 24 email from the Republican Attorneys General Association executive director, addressed to \"Generals,\" called the Atlanta event \"WAR GAMES\" and a \"series of conversations planning for what could come if we lose the White House.\" \"It was a fast paced, productive series of war games, which hopefully will not have to be utilized in November,\" then-Executive Director Adam Piper said in an email the next day, again addressed to \"Generals.\" Piper resigned from the attorneys general association five days after the violence in Washington and after the Defense Fund\\'s robocall came to light. The call did not advocate violence or suggest invading the Capitol. Taken together, the meetings and robocalls underscore how deeply elements of the Republican Party were invested in trying to keep Trump in office or to challenge the incoming Biden administration. Seventeen Republican state attorneys general, including those from Kansas and Missouri, also joined the Texas attorney general in a separate lawsuit seeking to overturn the presidential election results based on unfounded claims of voter fraud; the Supreme Court ultimately rejected that effort. An agenda for the Defense Fund\\'s Atlanta summit listed three policy sessions and a set of breakout sessions over two days. An email two days before the event from the Defense Fund\\'s executive director said, \"All the policy conversations are off the record.\" While the Defense Fund also allowed people to participate virtually, the emails said more than 30 people attended in person. In a written statement Thursday to The Associated Press, RAGA spokesperson Johnny Koremenos said the September 2020 meeting \"was strictly focused on administrative law and preparing attorneys general teams for a potential Biden Administration or a second term of President Trump -- common practice in an election season.\" Koremenos said GOP attorneys general have filed more than 40 lawsuits against Biden\\'s policies since he took office in January. That continues a tactic they used during former President Barack Obama\\'s administration -- and an approach used by their Democratic counterparts regularly during Trump\\'s four years in office. \"Were going to continue to fight back against the most radical and irresponsible agenda America has ever seen,\" Chris Nuelle, a spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, said Thursday in an email. Koremenos did not answer questions asked in multiple emails about whether Defense Fund videoconferences last year addressed possible challenges to the election results. The Defense Fund said in tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service that its mission is to share best practices among states\\' top lawyers, provide a forum for them to discuss state and federal policy issues, help them develop policy and \"engage\" federal officials \"regarding the interests of the states.\" In Missouri, contacts between the Defense Fund and state Solicitor General John Sauer, who is under Schmitts office, became public this year through a records request from a government transparency group. Schmitt said in January that he didnt know about the Defense Fund robocall, and his spokesperson said Thursday that he wasnt going to \"rehash\" issues raised early this year. Schmitt is running for the U.S. Senate in 2022. Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt\\'s office sent two staffers to the September \"war games\" summit -- Chief Deputy Attorney General Jeff Chanay and Communications Director Clint Blaes. Their pre-event travel authorization forms showed that the Defense Fund would cover their expenses -- as it did -- and listed the purpose of their travel as \"Training.\" Chanay said in an email to himself and Blaes that Schmidt had concluded the event \"serves a legitimate state purpose and interest\" and that the office otherwise would have covered their expenses -- making it legal under Kansas law for them to accept the Defense Fund\\'s hospitality. Their participation was first reported this week by the Kansas Reflector, which obtained 15 pages of emails through an open records request. The Associated Press also obtained the emails through an open records request. Another email showed that Eric Montgomery, Schmidt\\'s chief of staff, registered for online sessions. Schmidt, first elected in 2010, is running for Kansas governor in 2022. He served as a director of the Defense Fund but left its board in August 2020. After the Jan. 6 insurrection, he publicly condemned the violence as \"sickening\" and told The Topeka Capital-Journal that he hadn\\'t known of the robocalls beforehand. Schmidt\\'s spokesperson, John Milburn, said in an email that the September event was to discuss possible responses to regulations or other actions from a potential Biden administration that Schmidt worried might have \"devastating consequences for Kansas.\" \"There was no discussion about challenging the results of an election that was still six weeks away,\" Milburn said. ------ Associated Press writers Summer Ballentine in Columbia, Missouri; Meg Kinnard in Houston; and Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed to this report. ------ Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna\\nAs the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks were unfolding, then-Air Force Lt. Heather Penney was given a mission to intercept hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 before it reached Washington, D.C. The rookie F-16 pilot said she believed she would not come back from that mission. \"[I remember] how crystal blue the skies were that day,\" she told ABC News Live anchor Linsey Davis. \"There are so many moments that I remember with such clarity that I can touch, taste, feel hear, smell every detail from that day. But what strikes me the most, because of how omnipresent it was throughout the entire day was the deep, clear blue skies.\" At first, Penney said it wasn\\'t immediately clear that an airplane had been deliberately flown into the World Trade Center. When the second plane hit, \"that\\'s when we knew that our nation was under attack.\" She went to arm her aircraft, but there wasn\\'t enough time. She and another pilot, Marc Sasseville, had to get in the air. \"We did not have missiles. We were on a suicide mission. And in order to be able to take any airliner down, Sass would ram his aircraft into the cockpit where the terrorists were, to destroy the flight controls,\" she explained. \"I would take the tail by ramming my jet into the tail of the aircraft, I would aerodynamically unbalance the airplane and tip it over so it would crash straight into the ground by targeting both ends of the aircraft. It was our plan to prevent any additional casualties.\" After witnessing the horror of the attacks in New York, she said she understood what needed to be done. \"I had raised my hand and swore an oath to protect and defend our nation,\" she said. \"If this was where the universe had placed me at this moment in time... that this was my purpose. Anyone who had been in our position would have been willing to do the same thing. And the proof is in the pudding, because the passengers on Flight 93 did.\" Flight 93 was hijacked by four al-Qaeda terrorists nearly an hour after takeoff and diverted east toward Washington, D.C. \"We knew what needed to be done. And there were no tears. The prayers, to be honest,\" Penney said, were \"\\'Dear God, don\\'t let me mess this up.\\' Because of how important it was and the potential consequences if we were not successful.\" But Penney did not complete her suicide mission. Flight 93 passengers attempted to retake the plane, and in the struggle, the aircraft crashed in a field in Pennsylvania, killing everyone on board. It was the only one of the four hijacked aircrafts that day that did not reach the terrorists\\' intended target. Penney, whose call sign was \"Lucky,\" said she didn\\'t feel lucky for escaping her suicide mission that day. \"When you look back on the timeline, [the Flight 93 passengers] crashed their airliner nearly half an hour before we got airborne. I don\\'t consider myself lucky because what they did was something they never should have had to do. When they boarded Flight 93 that day, they were just simply going on a business trip or coming home from vacation... They hadn\\'t raised their right hand and sworn an oath to protect and defend like I had. I feel like we were a mission failure for so many reasons.\" Penney said she did not have the chance to reflect on what might have been. She \"immediately moved to 24/7 combat air patrols,\" flying from midnight to 4 a.m. for nearly a year, she said. Then, she went to train for combat operations in Iraq, where she served two tours. She said her reflection didn\\'t come until nearly a decade later when commemoration ceremonies honored the first responders, and her story came out. \"That\\'s really when I began to think about what I witnessed that day and the meaning of the sacrifice of those first responders and the heroism that they all displayed,\" she said. In New York City, 412 emergency workers who responded to the World Trade Center were killed in the attacks. Scores more who survived suffered from a litany of medical conditions, including cancer and respiratory diseases linked to the attacks. Penney hopes that now, 20 years after the 9/11 attacks, the nation can come together in the same way it did then. \"We have to make a commitment to stability. We have to make a commitment to engaging in that kind of dialogue and remembering that there are things that connect us... What it means to be an American is so much more than the differences that we [have] between us,\" she said. \"We need to recommit to understanding before judging... that those connections are more important than our differences, and to overcome or move past our fear and into the ability to serve. Move beyond ourselves.\"\\nSince introducing mobile order service several years ago, weve been continuously expanding the service to additional dining locations and adding new options like table-service to go for even more convenience.

You may have read the interview with Merchandise Graphic Designer Desma Thompson on the Celebration Collection. Today we are giving you an in-depth, behind-the-magic look at the Vault Collection filled with nostalgic replicas from the 1970s - with a modern twist! I recently caught up with Sr. Merchandise Brand Manager Hardlines Kevin-Michael Lezotte (aka K-M), who helped bring this amazing collection to reality. Read my interview with K-M below! Q: Can you tell me what it was like designing the collection? A: Where do I begin? My love of the Vault Collection literally started 35 years ago when I began my Disney career at EPCOT! Ive always been a huge fan of the Disney brand, the amazing experiences we deliver in the theme parks around the world and our incredible merchandise. Over two years ago, I was asked to be a member of our first task force to brainstorm the merchandise for the Walt Disney World 50th anniversary celebration. The small team I was a part of came up with the idea of reaching back into our merchandise history to \"bring back\" key souvenirs and inspire some new products. Hence, the Vault Collection. Q: I absolutely love the retro look and feel. Can you describe the collection and the inspiration behind the magic? A: The Vault Collection is made up of two main categories: \"Replica\" - Looking to the 1970s for those key souvenirs we lovingly re-created for this celebration. \"Inspired By\" - Taking cues from the retro art and styles over the decades, weve created a collection of modern and relevant items appealing to our guests today. For me, the inspiration was our most fervent fans and collectors. Im a huge fan and collector myself, and I know what it feels like to get something you love and didnt think youd ever find. These replica items will take some of our guests back to a time long ago when they were little and experienced the parks for the first time with their friends and family. Fun fact: A group of our team members went to the Walt Disney Archives to photograph many of the incredible souvenirs, and used those photos to help create some of the Vault Collection pieces you will see starting Oct. 1! Q: There are so many great items coming for the 50th anniversary celebration, but I cant wait to pick up the replica Minnie Mouse ears and Loungefly lunch box crossbody. They are so cute! K-M, what are your must-haves from the collection? A: I love the retro items in the home decor assortment. The castle trinket tray and the classic \"milk glass\" mugs are so cool! Q: I have to ask ... do you have any favorites from the original items that the team replicated in the new Vault Collection? A: There are too many to choose from but here are two. First, the retro plastic Minnie headband. This was one of the first things I purchased myself in the late 80s. I removed the bow and proudly wore the Mickey ears when visiting the parks, and I still have my original pair! Second, its a Vault Collection drop coming later. Its inspired by the looks of the year I started working at Walt Disney World Resort. Most items from the Vault Collection will be available beginning Oct. 1, with more items releasing throughout the 18-month celebration.

Guests can search throughout the district for character-themed pumpkins, fill a game board with stickers and redeem it for a spooky prize. \"I love Downtown Disney because every year we get to decorate it totally differently for each season,\" said Sara Dehghan, the Resort Enhancement team lead who managed the project. \"Theres a lot of space for creativity.\" Saras team was tasked with a new challenge: choosing pumpkins to be transformed into classic Disney characters. \"For Goofy, we picked a taller pumpkin, Mickey is more round and Stitch had to be smaller than Lilo,\" Sara said. The team worked with partners to ensure each characters unique features came through on the pumpkins -- from Plutos distinctive ears and nose to Moanas handcrafted necklace. The team also got to choose where to safely place each pumpkin--making sure to show off their best angles in the most appropriate areas for the characters they represent. For instance, Mrs. Potts is brewing outside Starbucks East, Princess Tiana is playing at Ralph Brennans Jazz Kitchen and BB-8 is hiding out at Star Wars Trading Post. Resort Enhancement cast will continue to check on each pumpkin nightly to make sure they always look their best for Guests. \"Im extremely proud of my team,\" said Sara. \"I cant wait for our guests to find these pumpkins and enjoy the transformations into Disney characters.\" Plutos Pumpkin Pursuit is available Sept. 9-Oct. 31, while supplies last. Guests can join in on the fun by purchasing game boards with stickers ($9.99) at select merchandise locations, including World of Disney, Disneys Pin Traders, Disney Home, The Disney Dress Shop and WonderGround Gallery. Guests can redeem their game boards at World of Disney or Disneys Pin Traders.

For Steve and his fellow artists, the last couple of weeks have brought a new artistic challenge in preparation of a new guest offering. This year guests visiting the Downtown Disney District will have the opportunity to join in Plutos Pumpkin Pursuit, a new pumpkin hunt, fun for the whole family. For Steve and team, its been a labor of love, painting the thirteen pumpkins that make up this pursuit, each one inspired by a different Disney character. \"The time to paint each pumpkin varies\" Steve shared, ranging between one to three days. Which one took the longest? Its hard to say for sure, but the \"details that went into the Moana and Tiana pumpkins really set them apart,\" and for that reason are two of Steves favorites. For the three artists working on the project, the \"most challenging aspect was drawing the layout, and painting on such the oddly shaped and uneven surface.\" For any of us amateurs that have tried our hand at pumpkin painting or carving its easy to understand the difficulty behind this project. After two weeks of hard work, Steve and team will be able to see the pumpkins being admired by guests of all ages. \"It feels great to showcase some of the stuff we paint, the guests seem to enjoy it.\" We know the guests will love it! We cant wait to see all the colorful creations in person, only at the Downtown Disney District. Plutos Pumpkin Pursuit will be available from Sept. 9 -Oct. 31, 2021, while supplies last. For more on all the offerings coming to the Disneyland Resort be sure to follow the @DisneyParksBlog on Instagram and follow the Disney Ambassadors for more cast stories. @DisneylandAmbassador | @WDW.Ambassador | @DLPAmbassador\\nThe readers of Travel + Leisure have spoken!

The \"long-range cruise missiles\" were launched on Saturday and Sunday and allegedly hit a target 1,500 kilometers away, officials said on North Korea\\'s state-run media. The missiles flew for over two hours, according to the report. The officials claimed the test was successful, and said the missile is \"a strategic weapon of great significance,\" to North Korea\\'s defense plans. Although the report said several top North Korean leaders and scientists were in attendance for the launches, there was no mention of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un being present. South Korean officials have not yet commented on the test launch.\\nIn the aftermath of President Joe Biden\\'s latest announcement that companies with over 100 employees must mandate vaccines or test all employees once a week, legal experts say the Department of Labor rule will be litigious and messy, but it just might work. \"There\\'s never been anything so extensive in American history that it requires vaccines across such a wide swath of Americans,\" said Lawrence Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the O\\'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. \"But I think he\\'s on rock-solid legal ground,\" Gostin said. Already, Republican governors have outlined plans to overturn the rule -- which hasn\\'t even been implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration -- on behalf of their constituents who believe it infringes on their individual rights. But experts who have reviewed the policy say Biden is acting within his power as president and backed by previous court decisions that have been pro-vaccine. \"I would argue that the basis for findings of grave danger and necessity, which is what statute requires, are probably stronger now for this use than they have been in OSHA\\'s 50-plus year history,\" said Lindsay Wiley, a law professor at American University in Washington, D.C., and director of the school\\'s Health Law and Policy Program. Generally, when the emergency statute has been used in the past, often for chemical exposure in the workplace, it\\'s also faced legal pushback. But it\\'s never been used in a public health emergency, Wiley noted. \"This is an unprecedented step, but unsurprisingly so given that it\\'s an unprecedented threat and situation,\" she said. David Michaels, the longest-serving administrator in OSHA history and a professor at the George Washington University School of Public Health, said the agency\\'s law is clear and straightforward: keep workers from getting infected at their jobs. He was glad the Biden administration, which he advised during the transition, was finally utilizing it. \"The legal requirement is not to vaccinate someone or to say you have to be vaccinated -- it\\'s, \\'This is what you must do to make sure the workplace is safe,\\'\" Michaels said. He called for the Biden administration to take the rule even further, extending it to all businesses rather than just those over 100 employees, and include an indoor mask mandate. The next question is whether or not the federal government, confined to the tools available in a country that rests much of its power with the states, has enough teeth to enforce the mandates. As an underfunded and understaffed agency, following up with two-thirds of America\\'s workforce to see if they\\'re either mandating vaccines or testing workers at least once a week would take OSHA 150 years, said Debbie Berkowitz, a former senior official at OSHA under President Barack Obama. Wiley agreed, noting that the agency has historically been \"pretty spotty\" at upholding measures. \"I don\\'t know that OSHA has the resources to really go out and do a lot of inspections and really strongly enforce this provision,\" Wiley said. But in states that are supportive of Biden\\'s rule, the state agencies could lend a hand, she said. On the other hand, even with its checkered record, businesses generally comply with most other OSHA standards for fear of an investigation and a fine. While OSHA is a small agency that \"often can\\'t inspect every time a worker complains,\" employers generally \"know what they have to do\" and will cooperate with the new rules when published, Berkowitz said. And failing to comply with this particular rule could cost up to $14,000, the White House said Friday, which would be bad for business in more ways than one. \"There\\'s the embarrassment,\" said Michaels. \"If an employer is cited by OSHA, that\\'s public information, and a lot of employers don\\'t want to be seen as scofflaws.\" Gostin, the Georgetown professor, predicted that Biden would order OSHA to prioritize enforcement of the vaccine mandate above other regulations. \"At the very least OSHA will send a notice of the standard to every large business in America and give them a deadline,\" he said. The new mandates could also offer cover for businesses that wanted to enforce vaccine mandates or testing but didn\\'t feel empowered to make the call without backing from a powerful entity, White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients said at a briefing with reporters Friday. \"The president\\'s actions will accelerate that number of companies across the board for employers over a hundred,\" Zients predicted. But the administration acknowledged that they don\\'t have the legal authority to mandate vaccines nationwide. \"We don\\'t have the ability to tell every American, \\'You have to be vaccinated.\\' There\\'s a means of encouraging it, of mandating it through certain pursuits or certain pathways, and that\\'s exactly what we\\'ve done,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday at a briefing. Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said he thought companies would begin to implement mandates even before the rule takes effect because Biden\\'s announcement, even without the regulatory action officially in place, would be enough. \"The biggest short-term thing that\\'s going to happen is that many companies that were reticent to institute a vaccine mandate as a condition of employment are going to feel emboldened to do so now because they have the federal government kind of giving them a stamp of approval,\" Adalja said. ABC News\\' Sasha Pezenik contributed to this report.\\nPresident Joe Biden paid tribute to the victims of the Sep. 11 terror attacks Friday, commemorating their lives and the losses of their families in a somber six-and-a-half-minute video. Biden, in prerecorded remarks to the nation on the eve of the 20th anniversary, hailed the shared sense of national purpose that Americans felt after 9/11, and called unity the \"greatest strength\" of the country. \"Unity is what makes us who we are, America at its best. To me that\\'s the central lesson of Sept. 11,\" he said. \"Unity doesn\\'t mean we have to believe the same thing. But we must have a fundamental respect and faith in each other and in this nation.\" Biden will travel to New York City Friday evening and will attend 9/11 memorials in New York City; Shanksville, Pennsylvania; and at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, on Saturday. \"No matter how much times has passed, these commemorations bring everything back,\" Biden said in the video, addressing the families of the victims. \"Jill and I hold you close, and send you our love.\" \"There are people around the world who you will never know who are suffering their own losses, who see you,\" he continued. \"Your courage ... gives them courage that they too can get up and keep going.\" Biden said the 9/11 attacks also exposed the \"darker forces of human nature,\" acknowledging the wave of Islamophobia that followed the attacks as \"fear and anger, resentment and violence against Muslim Americans, true and faithful followers of a peaceful religion.\" \"We saw a national unity bend and we saw that unity is the one thing that must never break,\" he said. Biden recalled speaking to a family friend in the days after 9/11 on the way to a meeting with students at the University of Delaware. The friend, Davis, had lost his eldest son at the World Trade Center, and his youngest son in a boating accident three years earlier. \"He told me to tell people, \\'Don\\'t be afraid. Tell them don\\'t be afraid.\\' The absolute courage it took after two unimaginable losses is extraordinary, yet the most ordinary of American things. To know that life can be unfair and uncertain ... but even in the darkness, to still be the light,\" Biden recalled. He invoked his friend\\'s words at the end of his remarks. \"We find strength in the broken places, as [Ernest] Hemingway wrote. We find light in the darkness,\" he continued. \"We find purpose to repair, renew and rebuild. And as my friend told me that September, 20 years ago, we must not be afraid.\"\\nThe Supreme Court allowing an unprecedented pre-viability abortion ban to go into effect in Texas has prompted questions on the status of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark ruling that\\'s supposed to protect the right to abortion nationally. To some experts, this marks the end of the line for the right to abortion to be federally protected, especially with an upcoming case soon to be heard by the court that directly challenges Roe. \"Roe v. Wade is dead in Texas, the second-most-populous state,\" Elizabeth Sepper, a University of Texas at Austin School of Law professor, told ABC News, \"and I think it\\'s really hanging by a thread for much of the rest of the nation.\" Not overturned, but some say ignored in Texas case The Supreme Court did not remark on the constitutionality of the Texas law, but it did reject a request for an emergency injunction, citing technical grounds, in a brief so-called shadow docket, allowing the law to go into effect while it\\'s being legally challenged. \"So we don\\'t see a citation to Roe v. Wade, we don\\'t see a discussion of the constitutionality of banning abortion, but here we are, right?\" Sepper said. \"Abortion is banned in the state of Texas, and that speaks volumes beyond this mealy mouthed sentence and the one paragraph we got from the court.\" In 1973\\'s Roe and in 1992\\'s Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court affirmed \"the constitutionally protected liberty of the woman to decide to have an abortion before the fetus attains viability and to obtain it without undo interference from the State.\" The Texas law bans physicians from providing abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy -- well before viability. \"To have allowed that to happen in this procedural way,\" said Kimberly Mutcherson, a co-dean and law professor at Rutgers Law School, referring to the Supreme Court, \"is something that I would have thought they were at least a little bit too good for, but apparently I was wrong.\" On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued the state of Texas to block the law, with Attorney General Merrick Garland calling it \"clearly unconstitutional under long-standing Supreme Court precedent.\" Ripple effect Since the near-total ban in Texas was allowed to go into effect, Republican lawmakers in other states have said they aim to mimic the law. Priscilla Smith, a senior fellow at Yale Law School\\'s Program for the Study of Reproductive Justice who argued in front of the Supreme Court in a 2000s abortion case, called the court\\'s action \"cowardly\" and \"completely lawless.\" \"It overturned it in effect in that it\\'s saying, \\'Here\\'s how you can get out from under Roe.\\' So it\\'s instructing states on how to do something to make it so Roe doesn\\'t apply in their state,\" she said. The Texas law is different from previous bans in that it prohibits the state from enforcing the ban, instead authorizing private citizens to bring civil suits against anyone who \"aids or abets\" an abortion. With that, Mutcherson said, \"they created this sort of confusion and this hook that the Supreme Court was able to use.\" \"This kind of tactic is going to be used throughout the country in anti-abortion states to deprive women of federal constitutional protections,\" Smith said. Upcoming case Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case this term from Mississippi, Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\'s Health Organization, challenging another pre-viability ban. The state of Mississippi formally asked the court to overturn Roe as part of that case. \"The Supreme Court\\'s decision not to decide with regard to the Texas abortion law signals quite strongly, I think, the outcome on the Mississippi 15-week ban on abortion,\" Sepper said. Because precedent might indicate the Texas ban should have been enjoined, Sepper said, \"I think that does signal really the end of Roe.\" Smith agreed: \"There\\'s no reason to think they\\'re not just going to overturn the right itself.\" Since 2018, Chief Justice John Roberts has stepped in as a swing vote on abortion, including siding with the liberal-leaning justices in the latest full abortion case, although his opinion followed more procedural lines. But the Supreme Court balance has changed since 2018 with former President Donald Trump\\'s appointments, who have voted more conservatively. Roberts joined Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan in dissenting on the Texas law, but his vote did not make theirs the majority opinion. \"Justice Roberts is no longer the swing vote,\" Smith said. \"I don\\'t think there is a swing vote.\" Acknowledging it was \"possible\" one of the Trump-appointed justices could side with the liberal-leaning justices, Smith said, \"There\\'s no indication that anybody\\'s going to swing.\" Sepper posited the justices could overtly overturn Roe or do it in a \"sneaky, silent sort of way,\" like by changing a standard that opens the door for more restrictions and bans. Possible political repercussions While the door has arguably been opened for state lawmakers to ban abortion, some argue they may not want to because of potential political repercussions. A 2019 ABC News/Washington Post poll showed a majority of Americans support the right to abortion, so lawmakers could face backlash from voters if they actually ban it. Many conservative lawmakers have introduced bills restricting abortion knowing that they would probably never go into effect because they were unconstitutional, Sepper added. \"So these legislators got credit with the anti-abortion activists for passing the laws, but they didn\\'t have to face the electoral consequences of having banned abortion or denied emergency abortion care,\" she said. \"The fact that they may soon face those political repercussions is something they\\'re going to have to think about.\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is already facing backlash for the new law\\'s lack of exceptions for cases of incest or rape. One way for voters to indicate disapproval is protesting, and while there have been some demonstrations about the Texas law, Smith said she\\'s surprised there aren\\'t more. \"And I\\'m not sure why they\\'re not, except that people are getting this idea that this is just a procedural move,\" she said. \"If Dobbs comes through the way the anti-abortion folks want it to, if Roe gets overturned in Dobbs, then maybe people will wake up and hit the streets. But you know, if you\\'re in a red state right now, you better watch out.\"\\nU.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy defended President Joe Biden\\'s new mandates to vaccinate 100 million Americans against COVID-19, calling it an \"ambitious\" and \"thoughtful\" plan as the country has faced more than 100,000 cases a day for the past four weeks and roughly a quarter million new cases being reported among children. \"The requirements that he announced are not sweeping requirements for the entire nation,\" Murthy told ABC \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos. \"These are focused on areas where the federal government has legal authority to act.\" Reaching a milestone this week, 75% of American adults have now received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but Murthy warned that the delta variant is a \"tough foe\" that has \"thrown curve balls\" at any progress made. He said Biden\\'s actions \"have to be taken\" to help get through the pandemic. The president on Thursday unveiled a six-part strategy to combat the delta variant that includes a new Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule for private businesses with over 100 employees to either require workers to be fully vaccinated or face weekly testing -- covering roughly 80 million workers. The vaccine mandate is now also required for 17 million health care workers and 4 million federal government employees and contractors, but they won\\'t have the option to undergo weekly tests. \"We know that these kinds of requirements actually work to improve our vaccination rates,\" Murthy said. \"Tyson Foods, for example, which put in a vaccine requirement recently saw that its vaccination rate went from 45% to more than 70% in a very short period of time and they\\'re not even at their deadline yet.\" The president\\'s mandate on private businesses received swift criticism and legal threats from Republican governors, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who called it \"fundamentally wrong\" for someone to lose their job for not being vaccinated. Murthy pushed back against that opposition, saying Sunday that \"there are requirements that we put in workplaces and schools every day to make sure that workplaces and schools are safe,\" such as mandatory vaccines for children to attend school. \"This is not an unusual phenomenon. What it is, is I think an appropriate response for us to recognize that if we want our economy to be back, if we want our schools to stay in session, we\\'ve got to take steps to make sure workplaces and learning environments are safe and these requirements will help do that,\" he continued. The surgeon general also defended the administration\\'s actions against legal challenges, saying it \"wouldn\\'t have been put forward if the presidents administration didnt believe that it was an appropriate, legal measure to take.\" \"The COVID virus is a dangerous virus,\" he continued. \"It makes our workplaces and our schools, far less safe than they should be. So this is an appropriate action, we believe, and it\\'s certainly from a public health perspective -- most importantly -- will help keep workers safe.\" Pressed by Stephanopoulos on whether these mandates might harden the opposition to vaccinations, Murthy said it is \"absolutely understandable\" that this pandemic may have triggered \"a lot of anger, a lot of fatigue, a lot of impatience,\" but that it should not \"turn us on each other.\" \"Our enemy is a virus, it is not one another,\" he said. \"And what we have to do is approach, this next phase of the pandemic response recognizing we\\'ve got to listen to each other before we rush to judgment. We\\'ve got to support one another in our decision making and during times of crisis.\" This is the first time OSHA will create a rule requiring vaccinations and White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that they are hoping the rule making proceeds \"as quickly as possible.\" While Biden continues to take criticism from the right for going too far, there are also calls from others who have said he\\'s not doing enough. Dr. Leana Wen told NPR that Biden should go \"even further\" and impose mandates for interstate travel, while others are calling for the administration to find a way and require vaccines for 12- to 17-year-olds. \"We will always be looking for more measures that we can take,\" Murthy told Stephanopoulos in response to those wanting a more aggressive response. \"But I do think that this series of measures taken here present a strong step forward and they will ultimately help protect our communities.\" As hospitals feel the crush across the country -- with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showing there are four times more patients in hospitals than a year ago -- Murthy said the trajectory of the pandemic over the next several months \"depends on what we collectively do as a society in the weeks ahead.\" \"Do we reach out to our family and friends and urge them to get vaccinated? Do we step up and use our masks in indoor public settings, recognizing that there is good scientific evidence that it helps reduce the spread of the virus? Do we ensure that in our schools we are taking the layers of precaution that we know help keep our kids safer from masks to regular testing to improved ventilation?\" he asked. \"If we take those steps, George, I think we can make a lot of progress in the months ahead. But it really does depend on us and what we do together.\"\\nThe Biden administration in recent weeks has announced a series of mandates that require long-term care facilities to fully vaccinate staff against COVID-19, drawing mixed responses from providers, industry leaders and advocates, including those who said the federal policies will put extra strain on an industry already suffering a workforce shortage. But some nursing homes said they\\'ve already successfully implemented their own mandates without a significant impact on their workforces, which officials say showcases how the new federal rules can be carried out to protect vulnerable elderly residents amid yet another coronavirus surge. President Joe Biden\\'s mandate, announced last month, directly targets nursing homes -- employees in long-term care settings must be vaccinated for those facilities to continue receiving federal Medicare and Medicaid funding. Additional White House announcements made this week could also indirectly affect nursing homes, including an upcoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule that would mandate private businesses with at least 100 employees require employees to either be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing. Businesses that don\\'t comply with the agency\\'s rule could face fees of up to $14,000. The proposed rules would also require health care facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement to have a vaccine mandate. Genesis HealthCare, one of the largest nursing home providers in the country, said almost 100% of its staff was vaccinated by Aug. 23, except for a \"small number of individuals who received medical or religious exemptions,\" spokesperson Lori Meyer told ABC News. \"Thoughtful and supportive dialogue, clinician-led family and peer discussions about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, and the looming federal mandate all played important roles in seeing the vast majority of our unvaccinated employees choose to become vaccinated,\" said Meyer, adding that two weeks after Genesis finished vaccinating its staff, COVID cases among residents declined by nearly 50%. When the nationwide push to vaccinate the most vulnerable population began in December, nursing homes were at the front of the long-term care industry\\'s battle against the pandemic, with facilities across the country reporting more than 33,000 cases and 6,000 deaths a week. Within six months into the effort, cases and deaths among residents at long-term care facilities had dropped by nearly 99%, with the vast majority of residents at long-term care facilities fully vaccinated, according to data published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services. As of Aug. 29, the latest weekly data available, nursing homes reported an average of 84% of residents per facility vaccinated and roughly 63% of staff vaccinated, federal data shows. In recent weeks however, COVID cases and deaths have been on the rise again in long-term care facilities as the delta variant rips through the country. A recent study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the effectiveness of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines among nursing home residents has declined significantly over the past few months with the advent of the delta variant, from 74.7% in March through May to 53.1% in June and July. Experts have cited this data to advocate for multi-pronged and layered prevention strategies for nursing homes, including vaccinations of staff members, residents and visitors, contractors, as well as appropriate testing and possible booster shots. While the overall staff vaccination rate hasn\\'t gone up by much since Biden\\'s announcement of the nursing home mandate, more facilities are reporting a higher staff vaccination rate, CMS data shows. As of Aug. 29, nearly 3,800 facilities out of more than 15,200 that report to the CMS have fully vaccinated less than 50% of their staff, down from roughly 4,000 facilities the prior week, federal data shows. And the number of facilities that reported vaccinating less than 30% of their staff also decreased over the week, from more than 900 in the week Biden announced the mandate to 800 the following week. Most of the facilities with the lowest vaccination rates are in Florida, Texas, Missouri and Ohio, where vaccine hesitancy rates tend to be higher. But more than 3,000 other facilities reported fully vaccinating more than 80% of their staff, a rate almost on par with the national vaccination rate of nursing home residents, the data shows. Among those, 122 reported vaccinating 100% of their staff. The Jewish Home Family, a New Jersey-based senior care facility in a part of the state ravaged by the pandemic, is one of the nursing homes that\\'s finished vaccinating all employees. During that process, the facility ended up letting go five of 350 employees, CEO and President Carol Silver-Elliott said during a press conference last week. \"We felt it was a small price to pay to keep our elders safe, and it is something we feel very very strongly about,\" Silver-Elliott said. \"It doesn\\'t take much to invoke those images of what horrible experiences we all went through, and to all of them suffered losses of friends and colleagues and family members and elders, so I think that made a difference too.\" Dayspring Senior Living in northern Florida, near the Georgia state line, has had a vaccine mandate in place for all employees since January, achieving 99% compliance, Executive Director Doug Adkins told ABC News. He said one employee sought medical accommodation, and another who resigned rather than get a vaccine ended up getting vaccinated and returning to work. Late last week, Dayspring Senior Living rolled out booster shots for staff and residents approaching the eight-month mark since getting vaccinated, Adkins said. \"No one likes to be told what to do -- this is no different,\" Adkins said, but \"once the employee is vaccinated, then I believe they appreciate the fact that the majority of the workforce is vaccinated and the environment is safe.\" So far, Dayspring hasn\\'t seen many breakthrough cases with symptoms, Adkins added. Despite his facility\\'s successful staff vaccination effort, Adkins said rather than create a mandate tied to federal funding, a better approach would have been to offer tax incentives to companies that decided on their own to implement a vaccination mandate to help them compete and develop a workforce that helps keep residents safe amid ongoing staffing shortages. David Totaro, chief government affairs officer at BAYADA Home Health Care, a multinational long-term nursing care provider headquartered in New Jersey, said during a press conference last week that if a mandate is implemented, support for increased expenses is needed. He said a state-level mandate in New Jersey, for example, which requires weekly testing for unvaccinated staff, could cost providers tens of thousands of dollars on testing each week and \"significantly hurt\" their ability to react to current workforce shortages The American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living, which represents more than 14,000 nursing homes, as well as other local nursing home advocates, are urging the Biden administration to expand the vaccine requirement to all health care settings, not just nursing homes. \"If other local health care providers and private industries are not implementing vaccine mandates, nursing homes are rightfully concerned that unvaccinated employees may leave to work elsewhere,\" said AHCA spokesperson Beth Martino. \"Otherwise, the administration will exacerbate an already dire workforce crisis in long-term care.\"\\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. -- It\\'s a familiar refrain among California\\'s recall watchers: 2021 is not 2003. Yes, the state again is in the middle of a recall election that could remove the Democratic governor from office. But today\\'s California electorate looks far different than it did 18 years ago: It\\'s less Republican, more Latino and Asian, and younger -- all trends that favor Gov. Gavin Newsom, so long as he can get his voters to turn out. \"Newsom has always had it by the numbers, and he knows that,\" said Mindy Romero, director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California and an expert in voters and the electorate. Early voting has been going on for weeks and more than 7 million ballots have been cast so far. The final day to vote is Tuesday. There are two questions on the ballot: Should Newsom be recalled and, if so, who should replace him? If a majority wants him gone, whoever gets the most support among the 46 names on the replacement ballot will become governor. It would almost certainly be a Republican since no Democrat with political standing is running. Conservative talk radio host Larry Elder has been leading in polls. The recall began as an effort driven by amateur Republican political organizers upset by Newsom\\'s positions on immigration, crime and other issues. But the coronavirus pandemic, and frustrations over business and school closures, got it on the ballot. In 2003, Democrat Gray Davis became the first California governor to get recalled. He had just begun his second term and voters were agitated over an energy crisis that had led to rolling power outages, looming tax and fee increases and a poor economy. Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger jumped into the race and won handily. Back then, about 9 million of nearly 15 million registered voters participated in the race. Roughly 4 million backed Davis, or 44%. On the question of who should replace him, Schwarzenegger got about 4.2 million votes. At the time, about 35% of voters were registered Republicans, 43% were Democrats and 16% weren\\'t in a party. Today, California has 22 million registered voters but the Republican Party claims just a quarter of the electorate because registration numbers have remained essentially flat, hovering above 5 million. Democrats, meanwhile, have added 3 million voters, and 2.6 million more people are independents. Latino voters now make up more than a quarter of registered voters compared to 17.5% in 2003, according to data provided by Romero. Asian voters also increased their share, now at 10.4%. As those demographic groups have grown, the overall electorate is younger. \"It\\'s not like it\\'s Baby Boomers that are Latinos and Asian Americans moving from another state to California. These are people born and bred in this state and they are aging into the electorate,\" said Sonja Diaz, founding director of the Latino Policy & Politics Initiative at the University of California, Los Angeles. All of those trends should benefit Democrats, who have only strengthened their hold on the state over the past two decades. Californians haven\\'t elected a Republican to elected office since 2006, when Schwarzenegger won a second term, and Democrats today hold supermajorities in both houses of the state Legislature. Though former Republican President Donald Trump increased his support among Latinos between 2016 and 2020, the Latino population still heavily favors Democrats in California, Diaz said. But Diaz said the party can\\'t be taking Latino voters for granted, particularly as their power as a voting bloc expands. Latinos now make up 40% of California\\'s population of nearly 40 million people, more than any other racial or ethnic group. Yet they are less likely to vote than other groups. Campaigns often focus on likely voters, which usually means people with a track record of participating. Though a focus on those voters certainly helps candidates win in the short term, the Democratic Party should be thinking out a long-term strategy for turning non-white voters into regular participants, Diaz said. Recent polling shows Newsom poised to defeat the recall and early voter turnout is strong for Democrats, though neither guarantee that Newsom will win. Turnout so far among Latinos and voters 18 to 34 is disproportionately low. None of the 6 million voters in that age group were old enough to vote in the 2003 election. Newsom has turned the race into a highly partisan one, branding the recalls supporters as extreme Republicans in an effort to ensure the states Democratic voters not only stick with him, but show up to vote. Hes focused his attention on Elder, who has a libertarian bent and does not support abortion rights or the minimum wage, among other policies supported by most Californians. Newsom, after voting Friday in Sacramento at an early vote center, said he\\'s taking nothing for granted in the race\\'s final days. \"Im just focused on doing the job, encouraging folks to turn out and to get our base out at this critical juncture,\" he said. ------ See APs complete coverage of the California recall election: https://apnews.com/hub/california-recall\\nRICHMOND,, Va. -- Workers at the site in Virginia\\'s capital where a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was taken down this week installed a new time capsule Saturday within the statue\\'s massive pedestal, after efforts to locate an 1887 capsule were suspended. The capsule\\'s installation, which a state government official confirmed was completed Saturday morning, contains remembrances of current events, including those related to COVID-19 and protests over racial injustice. It was demonstrations last year over racism and police brutality nationwide -- including in Richmond -- following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis that led Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to order the removal of the enormous Lee statue. The statue was taken down Wednesday, almost a week after the Virginia Supreme Court cleared the way with a decision involving litigation that had blocked the removal. Crews had spent much of Thursday locating without success the late-19th century capsule that state officials believe was buried within the pedestal, removing massive stones. The search didn\\'t continue. The reassembly of the pedestal was completed by Saturday afternoon, according to Dena Potter, a spokeswoman for the state agency managing the job. The Lee statue was one of five Confederate tributes along Richmonds Monument Avenue and the only one that belonged to the state. The four city-owned statues were taken down last summer. State officials plan to leave the Lee pedestal in place, at least for now, with the expectation that a community-involved rethinking of Monument Avenue will kick off soon. The new capsule contained items such as an expired vial of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, a Black Lives Matter sticker and a photograph of a Black ballerina with her fist raised near the Lee statue during last summers protests in Richmond.\\nThe estate of a man fatally shot in downtown Portland after a pro-Trump car rally last year is suing the city, the mayor and the county district attorney PORTLAND, Ore. -- The estate of a man fatally shot in downtown Portland after a pro-Trump car rally last year is suing the city, the mayor and the county district attorney, saying their negligence contributed to his violent death. The suit, filed Friday in federal court in Portland, contends a \"hands-off approach\" to political demonstrations and counter-protests in the city fostered a \"culture of vigilante policing\" between opposing factions that filled the void and led to the killing of Aaron \"Jay\" Danielson on Aug. 29, 2020. It seeks $13 million in damages -- $1.5 million in economic damages, $1.5 million in non-economic damages and up to $10 million in punitive damages, the Oregonian/OregonLive reported. \"We are seeking justice for the preventable death of a young man, gunned down in a city with a dangerous and deadly hands-off approach to public safety,\" Christopher Cauble, the estates attorney, said in a statement. \"Time and time again, City leadership and law enforcement have failed to find an effective response to clashing groups of protesters.\" City Attorney Robert Taylor declined comment on the suit. The Danielson estate also accused Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt of playing a role by broadcasting last summer that he had adopted a new policy and generally wouldnt pursue what he considered public order crimes such as criminal mischief, interfering with an officer or a stand-alone riot charge, and instead would focus on deliberate property damage and threats of force or actual force against others. Schmidts office didnt immediately return a message seeking comment. Residents protested police violence against people of color in cities around the country after the 2020 death of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a white officer in Minneapolis. In Portland, demonstrations were nearly nightly and led to complaints that authorities were heavy-handed in their use of force to control crowds. Michael Reinoehl, a self-described anti-fascist who said he provided security for racial justice protests in Portland, appeared to have targeted Danielson, according to surveillance camera video of the shooting released by police. Reinoehl, 48, emerged from an alcove of a downtown parking garage before firing two gunshots as Danielson was walking in downtown after the rally, according to a police affidavit. The suit says Danielson deployed bear spray at Reinoehl in response to the gunshots. Danielson, 39, died from a single bullet to the upper right chest, an autopsy found. Danielson had been with his friend Chandler Pappas and both were wearing Patriot Prayer hats, signifying their support of the right-wing group based in Vancouver. Reinoehl was shot and killed days later outside a Washington apartment complex when officers from a multi-agency federal task force moved in to try to arrest him on a Multnomah County warrant charging him with second-degree murder and unlawful use of a firearm in Danielsons fatal shooting. The suit said that officers from the Rapid Response Team, the Police Bureaus specialized crowd control unit, were less than a two-block radius from the shooting but were following orders not to get involved that day between dueling demonstrators. \"Given the enormity of the press coverage over the past several years regarding clashes between left- and right-leaning protest groups in the downtown core of Portland, Defendants knew or should have known that violent clashes would occur,\" Cauble wrote in the suit.\\nAn animal shelter says it is looking for the owner of an ostrich chick that was found in the German town of Krefeld late Friday BERLIN -- Is anyone missing an ostrich? An animal shelter says it is looking for the owner of an ostrich chick that was found in the German town of Krefeld late Friday. German news agency dpa reported Saturday that passers-by called the fire service after catching the 1.4-meter (4-foot-6) -tall bird in a town park. A vet found the 4-to-5-month-old chick to be in good health, dpa reported. Krefeld Zoo said the bird wasn\\'t one of theirs.\\nKylie Willis says she remembers when her father told her that he wanted to enlist in the Army. She was 9 at the time, and said she wanted to tell him no. \"I think I just heard something in his voice, even at 9 years old, that made me know that this was important to him. So I said, \\'OK,\\'\" Willis told ABC News, sitting outside her home in Martinsburg, West Virginia. \"And, you know, seven, eight years later, we lost him because of that decision. And I struggled with that for a long time,\" she added, pausing to take a deep breath. Her father, Staff Sgt. Kirk Owen, was killed in August 2011, one month into his Afghanistan tour by a roadside bomb. According to Willis, Owen took the front seat of the car because he considered it the most dangerous place to be and didn\\'t want another soldier to ride in that position. \"My dad went over there for a reason. He went over there to protect people. He went over there to provide them clean drinking water. He went over there to make sure that little girls could go to school. and he did that. He did his mission. He did his job. And unfortunately, he was killed while he was doing that, but that doesn\\'t mean his sacrifice meant nothing,\" said Willis. That sacrifice is something Willis carries with her every day. Now, at 26 years old and expecting her first child, she said there\\'s not a day that goes by that she doesn\\'t think about what her family lost. For the past decade, she searched for a way to honor him and continue his legacy of service that she said he didn\\'t get to finish. Willis eventually joined Children of Fallen Patriots, a Washington, D.C.,-based nonprofit that provides college scholarships and educational counseling to military children who have lost a parent in the line of duty. Willis was one of the more than 10,000 children who have benefited from the organization, she said. \"I make sure that the other sons and daughters of our fellow service members know that their mommy and their daddy meant something, and that we love them and we will take care of them,\" Willis told ABC News, a tear rolling slowly down her face. Since 2001, more than 7,000 American service members have been killed fighting the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. For some families, like Willis\\', the cost was incredibly high. But each family with a loved one serving in the war made a sacrifice. In Bethany Montjoy\\'s case, her father survived the war and eventually came home. But by the time her father, Technical Sgt. Tim D. Montjoy had served 20 years in the Air Force, he had already missed more than a quarter of her life. \"You have these thoughts of when are they going to come back,\" said Montjoy. \"[You] want to talk to them, [you] want to hug them.\" As she grew older and as her father neared retirement, Montjoy said she wanted to channel her father\\'s legacy of service into helping other military kids who were also missing their parents. That\\'s when she and her father came up with the idea of getting military kids around high-profile role models like professional athletes. The pair created Operation Teammate, a nonprofit based in Georgia that introduces kids to athletes. Capt. Nathaniel Lee was only 7 when his father, an Air Force captain, was killed in a training accident in 1997. \"It was like in a movie where the chaplain and the commander pulled up in a car,\" said Lee. \"And my mom\\'s reaction was instant. She knew why they were there.\" Life changed quickly for Lee\\'s family. Without family close by, they moved back to Northern California where Lee\\'s mom was from. And while it was great to have the family support, Lee said that it effectively cut them off from the military community, which made it hard to relate to the new kids in his class. \"Being the new kid is already hard,\" said Lee, \"And I didn\\'t want to be [the] kid whose dad died, so I was telling people that my parents were divorced and that\\'s why my dad wasn\\'t around.\" Concerned that he wasn\\'t expressing his grief, he said his mother helped him find a place amid the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivor, or TAPS, an organization that works with those grieving the death of a military family member. At his first event, Lee said he opened up for the first time about his dad. Years later, though Lee became an officer in the Air Force and later joined the newly created Space Force. He said he felt the achievement wasn\\'t enough in honoring his father\\'s memory. Around that time he was promoted, he received an email from TAPS looking for mentors, and said he took it as a sign. At his first event as a mentor, he said the organizers brought all the mentors into one big room. \"They said: \\'Take a seat and leave an empty seat next to you, and a kid who\\'s lost someone is gonna walk in and sit down next to you, and it\\'s your job to start talking to them,\\'\" explained Lee, and said he was more than a little nervous at the time. Lee was paired that first day with Annelise Miller, whose father died in 2016 after 23 years of distinguished military service when she was only 8 years old. \"I remember my brother told me that it was OK to cry, but I didn\\'t really feel like crying,\" Miller, now 13, told ABC News, recalling the day she found out her father had died. It\\'s been five years since Miller sat down next to Lee that day in the oversized room, and their relationship is more meaningful than ever, she said. \"I don\\'t know anyone that has gone through mostly the same thing that I have gone through,\" said Miller. \"He understands what it means to lose a father figure. He lost him when he was young too, so I can relate to him,\" added Miller. \"No one\\'s grief journey is the same,\" said Lee.\\nThe anniversary was marked by several events across the country. Saturday marks 20 years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Hijackers crashed two commercial airliners into the World Trade Center, striking the north tower at 8:46 a.m. followed by the south tower at 9:03 a.m. At 9:37 a.m., a third hijacked airline crashed into the Pentagon. Twenty-two minutes later, the World Trade Center\\'s south tower collapsed. A fourth hijacked plane crashed into a field in rural Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 10:03 a.m. after passengers fought with and overcame the hijackers. At 10:28 a.m. the World trade Center\\'s north tower collapsed. In total, 2,977 people were killed, including many New York City first responders. The anniversary will be marked by several events across the country, including the annual commemoration at the World Trade Center Memorial in downtown Manhattan.\\nAt 9:59 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001, the World Trade Center South Tower fell. About 15 minutes later, photographer Shannon Stapleton scrambled over debris, peering through dust and smoke for pictures near the still-standing, but crippled, North Tower. Stapleton, then a freelancer for Reuters, took a few frames of a group of people emerging from what remained of the building\\'s lobby. In the middle of the group, a blonde woman clutches a jacket to her face. The corners of her mouth are turned down, her eyes downcast. Kayla Bergeron, head of public relations for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owned the buildings, had just made her way down 68 darkened and flooded flights of stairs. It had taken her nearly an hour to reach the bottom. Just before leaving the stairwell, Bergeron remembers seeing a bright light ahead of her, and she was filled with hope that she would escape the building with her life. She stepped into the light, but couldn\\'t see anything, so thick was the dust and smoke from the South Tower. That light she saw was the North Tower\\'s lobby. There, she heard a voice telling her to follow the footsteps in the dust. She stumbled her way along, following the marks left by others who had already escaped. She didn\\'t see Stapleton take the pictures of her and the other dirt-caked survivors. \"At that point, I heard someone say \\'run, run, run.\\'\" And she did. Around the same moment, Stapleton looked at the screen of his digital camera -- the first he had owned -- and, pleased with his pictures, decided to deliver them to his editor. Minutes later, after the two left the area, the North Tower collapsed. Stapleton thinks that if he had been using his usual film instead of having the immediate confirmation of good digital images, he might have stayed on the scene and been there when the tower fell -- and become another victim. The PR executive and the photographer were connected in that shared slender moment and by deep psychological gouges they both say they\\'ve only recently come to terms with. Twenty years later, they finally met, brought together by that picture. Both say they\\'re humbled by what happened to them on that day and what followed. Although Stapleton\\'s picture was published throughout the world, Bergeron didn\\'t realize it existed for several weeks after the attack. Her sister happened to see it in People magazine, Bergeron says. \"She\\'s a big junkie on celebrity stuff, and she sees the picture and can\\'t believe it,\" Bergeron recalls. Bergeron kept working at the Port Authority for nearly six more years. She helped shepherd the organization through the immediate crisis and then to the rebuilding of the 1,776-foot-tall tower that now stands about a block west of the old Twin Towers. \"I was always high energy. Go, go, go. Never stop,\" she says. When she left New York, she moved south to head public relations for the South Florida Water Management District, a key agency in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, a multibillion-dollar project intended to reverse damage to the crucial wetland ecosystem. But there was a near-constant anxiety that ate at her. And there were night tremors and flashes of light while driving. She didn\\'t pause long enough to contemplate what was happening to her, she says now. And when the anxiety became too much, she self-medicated with alcohol, she says. \"I was like a bit binge drinking, OK? I knew something was wrong, but not what. If I would drink something, I wouldn\\'t feel that anxiety.\" In 2013, after her water management district job was eliminated, she busted through her savings, lost her West Palm Beach condo to foreclosure and was arrested in Parkland, Florida, for driving under the influence of alcohol. She lost her driver\\'s license for six months. During that time, she says, her mother died of lung cancer in Georgia and she didn\\'t see her to say goodbye. Bergeron says she didn\\'t want her parents to know how far she had fallen. And to some extent, she says, she didn\\'t want to admit it to herself. After her mother\\'s death, she moved to Suwanee, Georgia, to be closer to her father. But her troubles weren\\'t over. After a boozy night in 2017, she drove into the back of another car and ended up in the Forsyth County Jail. She was arrested about a mile from her father\\'s home. As part of a plea agreement, she entered a treatment program and was subsequently diagnosed with PTSD and depression, she says. As part of that treatment, she also got involved with Special Equestrians of Georgia, a program that uses exposure to horses as a form of therapy. It has remained a huge part of her life. \"The first time I went to that farm, there was this big, beautiful mare,\" she recalls. \"Her name was Lily. I\\'m just talking, petting her. I\\'m not really paying attention. All of a sudden, she put her head right on my shoulder. And all of a sudden, all that energy that was wearing me down, it was like it was released into the atmosphere.\" \"I\\'m not a granola person,\" Bergeron says. But the horse had a magical effect on her. \"They have a sixth sense. There\\'s something magical about them that\\'s healing.\" Bergeron is now the program and outreach director for a nonprofit called The Connection Forsyth, which works with local courts in Georgia\\'s Forsyth County to help people facing minor criminal offenses manage their addiction and mental health problems. Many are veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. Many, like her, suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. For Stapleton, the years that followed 9/11 were filled with professional success. In 2005, Reuters hired him as a staffer, and for the next 15 years, he traveled from one disaster or conflict to another. He rarely stopped to pause or reflect on that dark day, he says. He just kept going. He documented Hurricane Katrina\\'s devastation of New Orleans in 2005 and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. He worked in Lebanon during the 2006 Israeli invasion and in Iraq. He\\'s covered many horrific mass shootings, including the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that left 20 children and six adults dead. Stapleton says he\\'s made a career documenting death and despair. He remembers riding on a motorcycle through the streets of Port-au-Prince in Haiti. A boy lay dead on the soft shoulder of the road, his head smashed in. His pockets picked. His shoes and socks stolen. \"You don\\'t forget these things. Little schoolgirls and schoolchildren walking over it like it\\'s nothing. Or in Lebanon, showing up when the U.N. workers got killed, and you know, that smell of ... rotting bodies in bags, at 100-degree temperature, you don\\'t forget that.\" In the summer of 2018, he says, it all came crashing down. He could no longer cope with having witnessed so much death across the years, he says. When not working, he says, he became anxious around people and so retreated from even his close friends and family. At work, he couldn\\'t face photographing death anymore. Eventually, he says, he couldn\\'t even work and took some time away from the viewfinder to seek counseling and therapy. It was a slow process, and when he returned to work, he avoided the office and his co-workers as much as possible. His boss, Reuters North America pictures editor Corinne Perkins, would meet him at restaurants around the city to keep tabs on him. But he was on the mend, finally, he says. After struggling to find the right therapist, Stapleton was diagnosed with PTSD and severe depression. He takes prescriptions to treat his anxiety and depression. Last year, he spent months on the road documenting how the COVID-19 pandemic was affecting the country. He drove from California to Las Vegas to Chicago and beyond. One day, just before Christmas last year, he took a picture of an unresponsive elderly woman with COVID in a Chicago hospital. Her nurse held up an iPad so family members could say something to her. When he returned to the hospital the next day, her bed was empty. She had died overnight. \"I went out into the parking lot. I smoked like five cigarettes, bawled my eyes out and called Corinne, and she was crying with me. It hit me really, really hard. Death again and again.\" Perkins says she takes great joy in seeing Stapleton blossom again and laughs that he sometimes calls her his second mother. \"We\\'re getting better at understanding that it\\'s not just war zones that can impact your mental health,\" Perkins says. \"That the trauma of covering the pandemic or of getting COVID or worrying about your family, or covering the fires and having a shotgun pointed at you and being called fake news.\" In late spring this year, Bergeron emailed Stapleton about the 9/11 picture. A French documentary maker had asked her about it. \"I contacted her, and it was like, we\\'d known each other our whole life,\" he says. Stapleton decided he wanted to meet her. In June, he went down to Georgia. During his visit, Bergeron took Stapleton to meet her beloved horse farm, and then to the courthouse in Cummings, where she often works. It was the same courthouse where she pleaded guilty to her second charge of driving under the influence and where a judge ordered her into a court-administered treatment program. There, Bergeron says she asked Stapleton to help her with an Army veteran who was struggling with PTSD and alcohol addiction after his time in Afghanistan. The veteran was in court for a probation hearing after pleading guilty to traffic charges, including one involving drinking under the influence, his fourth in less than a decade. \"I have been trying to get him out of himself,\" she recalls. \"He had a lot of issues.\" Stapleton agreed to try. He stepped forward and touched the man on his shoulder. \"Hey, brother. I\\'m Shannon, Kayla\\'s friend,\" Stapleton says he told the man. \"I just want you to know I\\'m here. [If] you ever want to talk to somebody, I can.\" Bergeron says she didn\\'t expect anything to come of it, and Stapleton went back to his hotel room for a nap. Not long after falling asleep, he was awoken by a call from Bergeron. The man, she said, wanted to talk to him. Stapleton got out of bed and drove 40 minutes north, back to the her office. \"Me and him, we had this deep, deep conversation,\" Stapleton says. The U.S. involvement in Afghanistan was coming to an end. \"He was in Afghanistan. So he\\'s seeing this whole thing collapse, and he\\'s seeing all his efforts go for naught.\" Stapleton isn\\'t sure that chat made a difference, but he says that at least the man opened up about his experiences, and that\\'s a start. When Stapleton was visiting Bergeron, she says she offered a little advice on dealing with PTSD: \"I told Shannon, \\'It\\'s therapy -- therapy and medicine. This will be with you your whole life. It never goes away, but it lessens over time.\\'\"\\nOf the 15 people who left from Engine 54, Ladder 4 that day, none returned home. 4 kids of firefighter who died in 9/11 discuss continuing his legacy at FDNY He was 39 years old, but those who knew Carl Asaro remember him as \"a big kid.\" He was a man who loved music, his wife, six children and his job as a firefighter. Asaro worked at Engine 54, only four miles from the World Trade Center. On Sept. 11, 2001, he was one of the first responders who answered the call to help. Of the 15 people who left from Engine 54, Ladder 4 that day, none returned home. Now, 20 years later, 65 children of New York firefighters who died have picked up their own helmets, inspired by their loved ones ultimate sacrifice. \"I think during this time its kind of expected to feel those old feelings and feel them resurge, but the days in between, when you dont expect it -- when a song comes on the radio and you see something that reminds you of him, those are the days that hit you a little bit harder,\" Asaros son Carl Jr. said. Four of the six Asaro children went on to continue his legacy as firefighters -- Carl Jr., Matt, Rebecca and Mark, who were 13, 12, 9, and 7 on 9/11. Rebecca remembers it was her moms turn to carpool that morning. \"I saw my dad that morning. That night before I asked him for tic tacs. I remember I was begging him, so before he went to work he dropped \\'em off and he kissed us goodbye,\" she said. \"In school they kept calling us one by one. My mom when she picked me up... she was just so frantic... I remember my mom was back and forth on the phone,\" she said. \"I was 9 and didnt really understand much of what was going on... I thought my dad pulled up one day and it was the chief to tell my mom what was going on. My mom didnt understand so then it finally hit her days later that he wasnt coming home.\" Matt took the bus home that day, knowing his dad was at ground zero. \"I was proud but I didnt know what happened. I didnt know the severity of it,\" he said. \"We didnt have no cell phones back then, and I remember just calling him and beeping and no answer, no answer. Thats how life got to be without him. Coming down here and just waiting -- people getting found everyday- alive, dead. They didnt find nothing, not a bone, not a hair, not a memento. It just kind of sucked.\" Asaros body was never found, so his family opted to bury a guitar instead, filled with notes from loved ones -- a symbol of his love of music. Rebecca was eventually inspired to follow her dads footsteps as a firefighter by seeing his impact. \"Its like the departments small and my dad had such a big heart,\" she said. \"Through the years after 9/11 we talked to people.. He impacted so many.\" For Matt, he said the bond formed at the firehouse \"is like no other.\" \"We grew up here,\" Carl Jr. said. \"I think for us to give back and live a life of service is one way to really feel connected with my dad and for us to feel whole in a way.\" The siblings agreed that being a part of the FDNY helped them cope with the incredible loss. \"Theyre a big part of our lives -- has been and always will be,\" Matt said, joking that his dad might have pointed out he wanted them to become doctors instead. For five years, his namesake Carl Jr. didnt visit ground zero. Now, he finds it peaceful, saying that because it was the last place his father was, he considers it his fathers final resting place. On the eve of the anniversary of one of the darkest days in American history, Carl Jr. reflects on a discussion he had with his sister. \"We were talking about how youre only truly dead when your name is mentioned for the last time, and I thought that was powerful,\" he said. \"If thats the case my father and these men that were killed that day and sacrificed their life, theyre going to live forever through their legacy and their actions.\"\\nThere are still two days to go before Californias gubernatorial recall election, but the current governors team and his leading opponent, Larry Elder, have each already indicated theyre ready for legal challenges. In a sit-down interview with ABC News Zohreen Shah on Saturday, Elder was asked repeatedly if he would accept the results of Tuesdays election, but he avoided answering, suggesting that as long as the governor is recalled, the election is legitimate. \"So many people are going to vote to have [Newsom] recalled, I\\'m not worried about fraud,\" he said. But Elder earlier this week made unsubstantiated claims of possible fraud at a campaign event, saying the recall could see similar \"shenanigans\" as many Republicans claimed happened in last years presidential election, despite no evidence of widespread election fraud. Elder\\'s campaign has an election integrity section on his website, where voters can fill out a form to report alleged incidents of voter fraud and sign a petition to investigate the results of the recall. Gov. Gavin Newsoms campaign team said they were prepared for potential lawsuits but wouldnt elaborate on specifics during a campaign stop Thursday. In the interview with Shah, Elder also deflected questions about some of the controversial statements he\\'s made in the past, such as saying slave owners should get reparations. \"Cover what I said about the election,\" he said. \"The election is occurring because people are unhappy with how California is being governed the last two years.\" If he were to be elected, Elder already has his first order of business planned. \"The first thing I\\'m going to do is repeal the requirement for state workers that they have to be tested once a week and they have to wear a mask,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think the science supports that.\" It\\'s the issues brought up by COVID-19 that previously plagued Newsoms political career and now, in recent days, have bolstered it. The Public Policy Institute of California reported that 60% of respondents approve of the way Newsom has handled the pandemic in a survey released earlier this month. Recent polling about the recall election looks promising for Newsom, as 56.2% of voters said theyll vote to keep him, a 4% increase from last weeks reported polling average, according to FiveThirtyEight. \"Democrats didn\\'t even take it seriously until literally, I won\\'t even say a couple months ago, I\\'d say six or seven weeks ago,\" Newsom told ABC News. \"People started waking up to this reality, we\\'re closing that gap every single day. We\\'re going to pull this thing out.\" The boost comes as President Joe Biden is set to travel to California to campaign with Newsom on Monday as a final push to motivate voters. But Newsom is facing new controversies in the final stretch. Actress Rose McGowan recently alleged Newsoms wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, tried to bribe her against coming forward with her sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein. A spokesperson for Siebel Newsom told ABC News the allegation \"is a complete fabrication,\" adding, \"Its disappointing but not surprising to see political opponents launch these false attacks just days before the election.\" McGowan will campaign with Elder on Sunday in Los Angeles.\\nSen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., reiterated his call on Sunday for a strategic pause on the $3.5 trillion budget resolution, while Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., doubled down on the need to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure and budget reconciliation bills. \"The urgency -- I can\\'t understand why we can\\'t take time to deliberate on this and work,\" Manchin told ABC \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos. Sanders, the Senate Budget Committee chairman, told Stephanopoulos that he believes both bills will be passed. \"I think we\\'re gonna work it out, but it would really be a terrible, terrible shame for the American people if both bills went down,\" Sanders said in an interview that followed Manchin. The budget resolution calls for investments in climate change policy, childcare and other social programs, and is wider in scope than the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which includes measures to improve the nations physical infrastructure. Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., another moderate Democrat, are key votes in the evenly divided Senate -- Democrats need all 50 votes to pass the budget reconciliation. Sinema has also expressed concern over the price tag of the bill. The tentative deadline for Senate committees to turn in their draft legislation to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sanders is Wednesday and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a bipartisan vote on the infrastructure package is scheduled on Sept. 27. But Manchin argued there is no need to pass a budget package as soon as next week. \"No one is saying they\\'re losing their benefits, because they\\'re going to extend up through next year,\" Manchin said. \"Why are we rushing for this one week?\" The moderate Democrat wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Sept. 2 calling for a \"strategic pause\" on the budget resolution that Democrats took the first step in passing last month. Many progressives have criticized Manchin over his calls for a strategic pause and have said they will not vote to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill without the budget bill, putting the infrastructure bill in jeopardy. Sanders reiterated that point in a tweet Saturday night: \"No infrastructure bill without the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill.\" Manchin, a key negotiator on the bipartisan infrastructure deal, has said he is optimistic that even if progressives don\\'t vote for the bipartisan infrastructure bill that there could be enough support from Republicans to pass it. Stephanopoulos asked if Manchin is concerned he may hold up the bipartisan infrastructure bill if he votes against the economic bill. Manchin said he \"respectfully disagrees\" with Sanders. \"I never thought the purposes of our -- the progress that we make in legislation was basically hold one hostage over the other,\" Manchin responded. \"You have a bipartisan bill in the most toxic atmosphere that we have ever had politically.\" \"If you don\\'t need bridges fixed or roads fixed in your state, I do in West Virginia,\" Manchin added. \"I have got all the problems that we have addressed in the bipartisan infrastructure bill, and that\\'s the one that has the emergency.\" Asked to respond directly to Manchin\\'s argument that Democrats should not hold the infrastructure package hostage to the reconciliation bill, Sanders told Stephanopoulos \"the converse is true, that maybe Sen. Manchin is holding the reconciliation bill hostage.\" \"I happen to think that Joe Manchin is right, physical infrastructure is terribly important,\" Sanders said. \"But I happen to think that the needs of the human beings of our country, working families, the children, the elderly, the poor are even more important, and we can and must do both.\" Stephanopoulos pressed Manchin on his ideal price point for the bill. \"What\\'s your bottom line? How long should the pause last? And what\\'s the most you would accept in a final reconciliation bill?\" Stephanopoulos asked. In response, Manchin only said that he did vote to use reconciliation, a means for Congress to adjust budgets including through tax spending, because he was opposed to the 2017 tax cuts implemented under the Trump administration. Corporate rates were slashed from 35% to 21%, adding over $1 trillion to the national debt. \"I voted to go on reconciliation because I believed that the 2017 tax codes were weighted to the high-end wealthy,\" Manchin said. \"I thought we needed to make some adjustments, but I\\'m not going to make adjustments on how much I want to spend.\" Manchin reaffirmed his concerns about inflation and adding to the national debt. The Biden administration wants to raise rates back up to 28% to cover the cost of the bill, but Manchin has previously said he does not want to go above 25%. \"I\\'m going to make the tax adjustments on what I think keeps us competitive, looking at the global rates, looking at things that we\\'re doing, making sure the wealthy are paying, making sure all corporations are paying something to have the privilege of doing business in America,\" Manchin added. Sanders emphasized the scope of the reconciliation bill, arguing that polling has shown now is the time for Congress to tackle these challenges through passing both bills. \"Working families cannot afford child care for their kids, young people cannot afford to go to college,\" Sanders said. \"And then on top of all of that, the scientific community is telling us that we\\'re looking at a cataclysmic crisis in terms of climate -- Oregon is burning, California is burning.\" \"I think we can do all of this,\" Sanders added. \"We can do the physical infrastructure. We can do the reconciliation bill, create millions of good jobs, and finally tell the American people that we are going to stand up for working families.\" Stephanopoulos pressed Sanders on the slim Democratic majority in the Senate. \"There\\'s no margin for error in the Senate. If you vote against it, it doesn\\'t pass. If Sen. Manchin votes against it, it doesn\\'t pass. I mean -- so, you\\'re likely, if you both stick to your positions, you\\'re going to end up with nothing,\" Stephanopoulos said. \"That is a possibility, and I think that would be a disaster for the American people,\" Sanders responded. \"But you\\'ve got the president of the United States, you\\'ve got leadership in the House and the Senate ... you know, this is not Joe Manchin versus Bernie Sanders.\" Sanders added that the \"real danger\" is that the infrastructure bill will not pass in the House, as some progressive Democrats have pledged to not vote for it unless the budget bill is on the table as well. Ultimately Sanders said he is optimistic about the bills prospects, pointing to the successful passage of the American Rescue Plan, Bidens first major legislative victory granting $1.9 trillion to stimulus payments and coronavirus economic relief. \"We worked together (on the American Rescue Plan), we did, and I think we\\'re going to do it again,\" Sanders said.\\nLiam Canavan, 19, never got to meet his uncle Sean, who would have become his godfather if he hadn\\'t been working a carpentry job on Sept. 11, 2001, renovating office space on the 98th floor of the World Trade Center\\'s South Tower. But this week, Liam came to Guantanamo Bay to see the five men accused of plotting the terror attacks for himself -- watching trial proceedings from behind triple-paned glass in the courtroom\\'s public gallery. \"It\\'s emotional. It\\'s hard to believe that they\\'re there. I think -- and I\\'m guilty of this -- but a lot of people don\\'t really know that the trial is going the way that it is. I wasn\\'t even sure who most of those men were until a few weeks ago, when we were planning to come down here,\" Canavan said during an interview Saturday morning. \"And once you really start to learn about the evil that they\\'ve committed, seeing them is just pretty terrible.\" He\\'s easily forgiven for not following every twist and turn of the legal proceedings. This iteration of the case alone has taken roughly half of his lifetime, and is still bogged down in the pretrial phase. Canavan and his parents came to Camp Justice as part of a program run by the liaison to the victims in the chief prosecutor\\'s office, which selects family members of the victims of 9/11 to act as courtroom observers. The families present this week also marked the 20th anniversary of the attacks by attending a remembrance ceremony inside the base\\'s chapel. Navy Capt. Samuel \"Smokey\" White, the top brass on the base, presented Canavan -- who aspires to join the Marine Corps -- with his commander\\'s pin. \"On this naval installation, more than any other place in the world, we remember this every day. We remember 9/11 every day. We think about it every day,\" White said. \"And I can\\'t help but look at the families that are here with us today, and I can\\'t even imagine how they\\'re feeling, how they feel every day, and especially on a day like today.\" Later, Canavan addressed the crowd assembled in the pews, thanking those who made the trip possible, as well as the prosecution for their \"relentless pursuit of justice for every 9/11 victim.\" \"The one thing that brings peace to my family is knowing that the men responsible for such pain are locked up here at Guantanamo Bay, and will never inflict pain again as a direct result of all the hard work that happens here,\" Canavan said of the five defendants, adding that he felt the case was \"moving closer to justice.\" But outside, he sounded less convinced that justice could be achieved. \"I don\\'t know if it\\'s even possible for, you know, the thousands of victims, even more thousands of families who\\'ve been affected by this,\" he said. \"I guess whatever the court decides is justice as long as they\\'re found guilty.\" Dr. Elizabeth Berry and her husband Paul also made the trip to Guantanamo Bay. Elizabeth lost her younger brother, Billy Burke, an FDNY captain who directed his men to evacuate the building before it collapsed while he stayed behind in the North Tower to help stranded office workers. Berry has been to Guantanamo frequently over the years. A clinical psychologist, she helps other victims\\' relatives process their experiences. But past that, she said it\\'s important that she keeps returning to the base because she wants to see a resolution. \"The world has moved on,\" Berry said. \"For me, being here allows me to keep in touch with what\\'s going on.\" \"I want to be a part of the process because I want it to come to a resolution. I want to see justice,\" she added. Berry said she is optimistic about the trial \"because we\\'re starting again, and we\\'re moving forward.\" She also thought back to the first time she walked into the courtroom, some 11 years ago. \"Walking into the courtroom for the first time was extremely emotionally powerful for me,\" Berry recalled. \"It was very moving.\" Canavan described a similar reaction to being in the courtroom for the first time. \"It\\'s special, and I never would have imagined it even being a reality. I\\'m glad to be down here,\" he said. \"And I hope I can come down again.\" With no date set for the trail to begin, he -- like Berry -- might have the opportunity to return for years to come.\\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom and his Republican rivals are making their final pitches to voters as the recall against the governor winds to a close OAKLAND, Calif. -- Democratic allies of California Gov. Gavin Newsom continued to express confidence Saturday in his chances of beating back a recall but warned his supporters not to let up on urging people to vote as they seek a decisive win, while Republicans said the contest is far from settled. \"We don\\'t need to just win by a little, we need to win by a lot. We need to send a message: Hands off our democracy, hands off our California,\" said April Verrett, president of the SEIU Local 2015, as she rallied union members who have been among Newsom\\'s biggest supporters. Newsom joined the Oakland rally as his Republican rivals made their cases up and down the state and both major parties sent volunteers out to knock on doors and urge their supporters to vote. The race concludes Tuesday, and more than a third of voters have already mailed in their ballot or voted early in person. A recent poll from the Public Policy Institute of California shows Newsom likely to survive, and Democrats are making a stronger showing in early voting. But the GOP is expecting a larger turnout on Election Day, given many Republicans are skeptical of voting by mail. \"Anyone who is counting the recall out at this point is not really in touch with what\\'s actually going on with this movement,\" said Republican Assemblyman Kevin Kiley, who is running to unseat Newsom and is favored by some of the recall\\'s original supporters. The ballot includes two questions: Should Newsom be recalled from office and, if so, who should replace him? If a majority of voters want him gone, he would be replaced by whoever gets the most votes among the 46 candidates on the replacement ballot. Newsom has encouraged his supporters to vote \"no\" on the first question and skip the second one all together, something Republican rival Kevin Faulconer criticized as he cast his own ballot in San Diego, where he previously served as mayor. \"Its very important that folks get out and vote. The fact that the Governor doesnt want people to vote on question two, that is voter disenfranchisement,\" he said, according to CBS News 8 in San Diego. Beyond campaigning, several candidates marked the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Larry Elder, who is considered the Republican frontrunner, helped read the names of people who died in the attacks during a memorial service in Southern California before having lunch with veterans. He shared anecdotes about his father, a veteran, and made his campaign pitch to the group, the Los Angeles Times reported. Kiley and businessman John Cox, another GOP candidate, also attended anniversary events, while Newsom visited the Wall of Heroes memorial at the California National Guard\\'s headquarters before his campaign event. More than 7.7 million people have already voted, according to ballot tracking data compiled by Political Data Inc., a data firm that works with Democrats. Newsom called the numbers encouraging and attributed it to more Democrats becoming aware of the recall as it winds to a close. Still, he said he\\'s taking nothing for granted. H will spend the next few days campaigning in Southern California, and on Monday he will be joined by Democratic President Joe Biden. He stuck to his closing message that the race could have profound consequences beyond California, calling it a contest of \"outsize consequences.\" He and other Democrats have likened it to former President Donald Trump\\'s refusal to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election and have charged Republicans with pursuing a recall because they can\\'t win a normal election. Californians haven\\'t elected a Republican statewide since 2006. \"The recall is about catching you while you\\'re sleeping,\" he said. \"This recall is about getting us in an off year, in an off month, while no one else is paying attention.\" The recall made the ballot through a process in the California Constitution for more than a century. Originally the recall was likely to be held sometime in October or November, but Democrats in the state Legislature sped up the process to allow for an earlier election. Republicans angry with Newsom\\'s policies on immigration, crime and a host of other issues sparked the recall drive, but it took off during the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers got more than 1.7 million signatures to place it on the ballot. That\\'s less than a tenth of registered voters. \"Gavin Newsom has failed Californians. From surging crime to a broken unemployment department and raging wildfires, our state deserves better than this governors serial incompetence,\" California Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson said in a statement. She was out Saturday knocking on doors in Los Angeles County. Meanwhile, the union leaders who rallied alongside Newsom pointed to his pandemic policies as life-saving measures for home health care and other essential workers. They also applauded him for increasing providers\\' pay, which was cut under former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the winner of the 2003 recall. The Service Employees International Union and its affiliates have donated at least $3.5 million to Newsom\\'s campaign, and unions collectively are his biggest financial backers. ---- Catch up with all of AP\\'s recall coverage here: https://apnews.com/hub/california-recall\\nIn the wake of a Florida judge calling the state\\'s anti-riot law unconstitutional, advocates are saying it should serve as a warning to other states looking to implement similar legislation. Chief Judge Mark Walker sided Thursday with civil rights groups suing Florida who alleged HB1 deters and punishes peaceful protests. Walker argued the language in the law was \"vague to the point of unconstitutionality\" and temporarily blocked the law from being enforced while legal challenges continue. \"Its vagueness permits those in power to weaponize its enforcement against any group who wishes to express any message that the government disapproves of.\" Walker wrote. \"If this court does not enjoin the statute\\'s enforcement, the lawless actions of a few rogue individuals could effectively criminalize the protected speech of hundreds, if not thousands, of law-abiding Floridians.\" Plaintiffs in the case praised the judge\\'s decision, saying it will contribute to the safety of protesters not just in Florida but across the nation. \"We\\'re happy about it, we\\'re happy that people can continue to take to the streets, and can continue to protest and feel safe doing so.\" Jessika Ward, press secretary for Dream Defenders, one of the plaintiffs in the case, told ABC News. \"We don\\'t want people to be in harm\\'s way and be arrested, just for, you know, saying how they feel and speaking up for injustices happening in our country.\" HB1, which was touted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, as necessary to protect law and order during protests, was passed on partisan lines earlier this year and was part of a growing movement from mostly Republican-backed legislatures around the country to pass similar legislation after 2020 was marked by demonstrations in the wake of George Floyd\\'s murder. The laws criminalize protests that turn violent and adds harsher penalties for people participating in these demonstrations, whether they were perpetrators or not. Since the murder of Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police on May 25, 2020, 11 states have passed anti-riot legislation and at least 231 bills cracking down on protests have been introduced across 45 states, according to the nonpartisan International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, which tracks legislation targeting the right to protest. Florida\\'s court decision could set a precedent for other states who are trying to or have already passed similar legislation. North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed anti-riot legislation in his state a day after HB1 was temporarily blocked. That legislation would have also imposed harsh penalties for protesters charged with rioting. While state lawmakers could bring a veto override, activists in North Carolina say what happened in Florida could dim those prospects. \"I\\'m hopeful that the court decision could actually discourage them from even trying to override the veto. Because, you know, maybe they\\'ll just see the writing on the wall,\" said Ann Webb, a policy analyst of the ACLU of North Carolina. In Oklahoma, civil rights groups are preparing for a similar legal challenge as in Florida for their state\\'s anti-protest legislation set to take effect Nov. 1. The law uses vague and overbroad vocabulary and discourages participation in protests by criminalizing it lawyers allege in the filing. As states continue their legal challenges, lawyers say Florida serves as a powerful reminder for how constitutional freedoms will be upheld in court. \"Just as bad laws have a dangerous way of being contagious, orders striking down bad laws or recognizing their unconstitutionality equally sends a message.\" Max Gaston, a staff attorney of the ACLU of Florida told ABC News. \"I think it\\'s a powerful reminder that such unjust and unconstitutional efforts cannot be tolerated and that courts will not tolerate them.\"\\nJust a few months ago, there were only five COVID-19 patients, at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise, Idaho. As of Thursday, there were more than 45. Nearly all of these patients are not vaccinated, a reflection of \"the amount of misinformation that\\'s being absorbed, and taken as truth in our community because people are convinced that they don\\'t want to be vaccinated, and then they end up here,\" Dr. Meghan McInerney, the intensive care unit\\'s medical director, told ABC News. Given the influx of patients, beds do not stay empty long. \"We are overwhelmed. We have so many patients with COVID, who are unvaccinated,\" said McInerney. \"On top of an already busy ICU, you add the volume of COVID patients that we\\'re seeing now and yes, it\\'s just added a different level of busy, a different level of crazy. ... It\\'s a lot. It\\'s a lot.\" Hospitals across the state of Idaho are now facing their most significant surge yet, as COVID-19 patients flood into emergency departments. Statewide, more than 600 patients are now hospitalized with the virus, the highest on record, and less than 13% of the state\\'s ICU beds remain available. Earlier this week, in an effort to address the ongoing surge, state health officials in Idaho announced that they had activated a \"crisis standards of care\" for the state\\'s northern hospitals, which will allow hospitals to ration care given the increased demand and a \"severe staffing shortage.\" The rapidly spreading delta variant has rendered the job of these front-line workers even more difficult, McInerney explained. Idaho currently has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S., with less than 40% of the state\\'s total population fully vaccinated; the national rate stands at 53.6%. \"It\\'s really hard to be a physician at the front lines, doing this every single day and living in a state where the vaccination rate is so low,\" McInerney said. In fact, all of the patients who are critically ill from COVID-19 and currently under care in Saint Alphonsus Boise have not been vaccinated, ICU nurse Jessica Parrott told ABC News, while \"the people who are not getting critically ill, are the people who have the vaccine,\" she added. The virus is also landing much younger people in the ICU, some of whom are in their early 20s. This particular wave of infections feels more \"aggressive,\" than those treated during the surge in 2020, said Dr. Carolyn McFarlane, a hospitalist at Saint Alphonsus Boise. \"The deaths within our system in the past 24 hours are a 30-year-old and another in their 50s. It feels preventable,\" McFarlane said. Staff are completely overworked and overwhelmed, McInerney said, and teams are facing a staffing crisis. Nurses are being increasingly asked to pick up extra shifts due to the influx of patients coming from all over Idaho, and even from outside the state. \"We don\\'t have the hands that we need to take care of everyone. And it is incredibly frustrating for all of those involved on every level, between [administration] down to environmental services,\" said Alicia Luciani, a COVID-19 charge nurse at Saint Alphonsus Boise. \"It\\'s affecting everyone and affecting how our patients are getting care. And we do our utmost to provide all that we can for these patients.\" However, she added, \"It\\'s incredibly frustrating. Everyone is so tired.\" In addition to the physical and emotional exhaustion from working shifts that feel like a \"silent battleground,\" medical staffers at Saint Alphonsus said they are disheartened by the continued unwillingness of some Idaho residents to get the vaccine. Although a number of patients do express regret that they have not received or sought out a vaccination, some even apologizing for it, according to nurse educator Monica Brower, others remain contentious, even after being on a ventilator and confronting the stark reality of their mortality. \"Don\\'t tell me I have COVID. I don\\'t believe in COVID,\" patients have told McFarlane, who teared up as she recounted combative patients. \"There is an almost adversarial tone to things when we ask, \\'Did you get vaccinated?\\'\" McFarlane said. \"It creates a rift in the tone of the room, because it\\'s a feeling of \\'well you\\'re going to treat me differently because I didn\\'t get vaccinated,\\' and that is far from the truth.\" In fact, said McFarlane, \"It almost gets to a point where you read the tone in the room and you shy away from even asking about vaccination status, because you want to be able to focus on saving the person\\'s life, not going into the politics behind the vaccine.\" As more unvaccinated patients fill hospital beds, Luciani said it has become \"really hard to maintain a level of hope.\" \"They stick to their guns,\" Luciani explained, and even on their death bed she\\'s had to listen to people deny that they have the virus, while maintaining their fervent anti-vaccine sentiment. \"In my mind, that life is essentially over as we know it. ... Some people just refuse. And it\\'s kind of like a slap in the face.\" \"They don\\'t get to see how hard we\\'re working to try to keep them alive. ... This is the real deal. This is what it looks like,\" McInerney said. When asked what keeps them going, McFarlane\\'s answer resonates. \"We are taking care of our communities, family members, people that are acquaintances, neighbors. ... We will do everything we can to care for them, because we care, because we have taken an oath, and it\\'s the time for us to rise to the occasion. And we are here for our community.\"\\nSpaceX\\'s Inspiration4 mission may sound familiar, as another billionaire-backed space launch, but it\\'s going where neither Richard Branson nor Jeff Bezos could -- into orbit. Branson\\'s Virgin Galactic and Bezos\\' Blue Origin sent civilians into space on brief, suborbital flights that lasted only for a few minutes. But Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX is just days away from sending its first all-civilian crew on a three-day mission around the Earth multiple times. Inspiration4 will orbit 360 miles above Earth, higher than the International Space Station, with no professional astronaut on board. It will be the first orbital space tourism flight that doesn\\'t have an astronaut to guide the passengers through launch and landing. Commanding the mission is 38-year-old billionaire Jared Isaacman, an experienced pilot. He founded a payment process company called Shift4 Payments and purchased all four seats on the flight for roughly $200 million. Isaacman wants this launch to benefit St. Jude Children\\'s Research Hospital. He has already donated $100 million to the cause, and raised an additional $13 million through a lottery to win a seat. One seat was reserved for a St. Jude ambassador -- 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. Arceneaux is a bone cancer survivor who was treated at St. Jude\\'s as a child and now works there as a physician assistant. She will be the youngest American to go to space as well as the first person with a prosthesis. Joining Arceneaux and Isaacman on their journey is Chris Sembroski, 41, and Dr. Sian Proctor, 51. Proctor said she has dreamed of going to space since she was a child. She once applied to become a NASA astronaut and made it to the final 47 out of 3,500 applicants, but was cut from the final round. She burst into tears when she heard she was chosen as a member of the Inspiration4 mission. Sembroski is an Iraq War veteran and engineer with Lockheed Martin, who won the final seat through the lottery that required a St. Jude donation to enter. The crew has gone through partial- and full-mission simulations and has been trained by SpaceX on \"the Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft, including a specific focus on orbital mechanics, operating in microgravity, zero gravity, and other forms of stress testing,\" according to an Inspiration4 release. They will launch from Pad 39A at NASAs Kennedy Space Center in Florida -- the same launch pad that Apollo 11 blasted off from -- sending man to the moon for the first time. Inspiration4 is targeting a launch no no earlier than 8 p.m. ET on Sept. 15. Since they aren\\'t going to the International Space Station, they dont need to launch at any specific time. The crew is planning to bring items on board the Crew Dragon spacecraft to auction off to benefit St. Jude, including artwork from patients. After three days of orbiting Earth, they will prepare to splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida.

The death toll from Hurricane Ida and its aftermath continues to rise, as locals try to piece their lives back together and officials rescue oil-soaked birds impacted by a storm-related oil spill. Overall, 84 people have died across eight states due to Ida\\'s wrath as a Category 4 storm that made landfall Aug. 29. In the Northeast alone, 54 have died. The death toll in New Jersey rose to 29 Friday after Passaic City Mayor Hector C. Lora said two bodies recovered from the Passaic River Wednesday and Thursday were identified as the two individuals reported missing the day the storm hit the state. They were identified as friends Nidhi Rana, 18 and Ayush Rana, 21, by the Regional Medical Examiner in the state, Lora said in a press conference Friday. Search and rescue crews had searched through the river throughout the week. Nidhi\\'s body was discovered in the water near Kearny Wednesday and Ayush\\'s body was found the following day near the border of Newark, authorites said. They were last seen in the Passaic trying to escape their car that swept away in the torrential flood waters triggered by Idas remnants and devastating rains, Lora previously said. \"They were both our prom king and queen this year... they were avid tennis players and members of community and school clubs,\" Lora said. Another man had died in floodwaters in Passaic. Luis Jalil-Solarzario, 70, of Clifton, died on Sept. 1 when his car got submerged in flood waters, but his wife, 66, and son, 25 were able to be rescued by firefighters, Lora announced last week. Meanwhile, in Louisiana, on Wednesday the Orleans Parish Coroners Office confirmed an 11 additional storm-related deaths, bringing the state death total from Ida to 26. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said Ida also affected animals in the state, with more than 100 oil-slicked birds documented from a hurricane-related oil spill at Alliance Refinery in Belle Chasse. The oiled birds have been spotted in heavy pockets of crude oil throughout the facility, nearby flooded fields and retention ponds, the agency said. The birds affected have been identified as black-bellied whistling ducks, blue-winged teal and a variety of egret species. Other wildlife observed with some degree of oiling include alligators, river otters and nutria. Officials say the recovery effect may take weeks. So far 10 oiled birds have been captured and taken to a rehabilitation center for cleaning. Five additional dead birds were recovered as evidence, The Associated Press reported. Power continues to slowly return to Louisiana, where more than one million were left in the dark in the immediate aftermath of Ida. Twelve days after Ida hit, more than 80% of power has been restored to 948,000 Entergy utility company customers in the South who lost power due to the hurricane, the company said in a Friday update. In Louisiana 166,000 remain without power and 76% of customers have had energy restored so far. In New Orleans about 1,000 remain in the dark, the company said Friday.\\nFormer President George W. Bush spoke at the Sept. 11 memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to mark the 20th anniversary of the attacks Saturday. The memorial commemorates the crash of United Flight 93, one of four commercial airplanes hijacked in the September 11 attacks. The plane crashed into a field after passengers fought with and overcame the hijackers. All aboard, including 40 crew and passengers, perished. Bush, who was in office at the time, reflected on the bravery of those passengers and the unity and heroism that took place in the days after the attacks, while warning about the lingering threat of terrorism, both foreign and domestic. He was joined by former First Lady Laura Bush, Vice President Kamala Harris, former Vice President Dick Cheney, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and others. The transcript of Bush\\'s speech was as follows. It has been edited for clarity: Thank you all. Thank you very much. Laura and I are honored to be with you, Madam Vice President, Vice President Cheney, Gov. Wolf, Secretary Haaland, and distinguished guests. Twenty years ago, we all found, in different ways, in different places, but all at the same moment, that our lives would be changed forever. The world was loud with carnage and sirens, and then quiet with missing voices that would never be heard again. These lives remain precious to our country and infinitely precious to many of you. Today, we remember your loss, we share your sorrow and we honor the men and women that you have loved so long and so well. For those too young to recall that clear September day, it is hard to describe the mix of feelings we experienced. There was horror at the scale of destruction and awe at the bravery and kindness that rose to meet it. There was shock at the audacity of evil and gratitude for the heroism and decency that opposed it. In the sacrifice of first responders and the mutual aid of strangers, in the solidarity of grief and grace, the actions of an enemy revealed the spirit of the people. And we were proud of our wounded nation. In these memories, the passengers and crew of Flight 93 must always have an honored place. Here, the intended targets became the instruments of rescue, and many who are now alive owe a vast, unconscious debt to the defiance displayed in the skies above this field. It would be a mistake to idealize the experience of those terrible events. All that many people could initially see was the brute randomness of death. All that many could feel was unearned suffering. All that many could hear was God\\'s terrible silence. There are many who still struggle with the lonely pain that cuts deep within. In those fateful hours, we learned other lessons as well. We saw that Americans were vulnerable, but not fragile. That they possessed a core of strength that survives the worst that life can bring. We learned that bravery is more common than we imagined, emerging with sudden splendor in the face of death. We vividly felt how every hour with our loved ones was a temporary and holy gift. And we found that even the longest days end. Many of us have tried to make spiritual sense of these events. There is no simple explanation for the mix of providence and human will that sets the direction of our lives. But comfort can come from a different sort of knowledge. After wandering in the dark, many have found they were actually walking step by step toward grace. As a nation our adjustments have been profound. Many Americans struggled to understand why an enemy would hate us with such zeal. The security measures incorporated into our lives are both sources of comfort and reminders of our vulnerability. And we have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders but from violence that gathers within. There\\'s little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home. But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard of human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our continuing duty to confront them. After 9/11, millions of brave Americans stepped forward and volunteered to serve in the armed forces. The military measures taken over the last 20 years to pursue dangers at their source have led to debate. But one thing is certain: We owe an assurance to all those who have fought our nations most recent battles. Let me speak directly to veterans and people in uniform. The cause you pursued at the call of duty is the noblest America has to offer. You have shielded your fellow citizens from danger. You have defended the beliefs of your country and advanced the rights of the downtrodden. You have been the face of hope and mercy in dark places. You have been a force for good in the world. Nothing that has followed -- nothing -- can tarnish your honor or diminish your accomplishments. To you and the honored dead, our country is forever grateful. In the weeks and months following the 9/11 attacks, I was proud to lead an amazing, resilient united people. When it comes to the unity of American people, those days seem distant from our own. Malign force seems at work in our common life that turns every disagreement into an argument and every argument into a clash of cultures. So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear and resentment. That leaves us worried about our nation and our future together. I come without explanations or solutions. I can only tell you what I\\'ve seen. On America\\'s day of trial and grief I saw millions of people instinctively grab for a neighbor\\'s hand and rally to the cause of one another. That is the America I know. At a time when religious bigotry might have flowed freely, I saw Americans reject prejudice and embrace people of Muslim faith. That is the nation I know. At a time when nativism could have stirred hatred and violence against people perceived as outsiders, I saw Americans reaffirm their welcome to immigrants and refugees. That is the nation I know. At a time when some viewed the rising generation as individualistic and decadent, I saw young people embrace an ethic of service and rise to selfless action. That is the nation I know. This is not mere nostalgia, it is the truest version of ourselves. It is what we have been, and what we can be again. Twenty years ago, terrorists chose a random group of Americans on a routine flight to be collateral damage in a spectacular act of terror. The 33 passengers and seven crew of Flight 93 could have been any group of citizens selected by fate. In a sense, they stood in for us all. The terrorists soon discovered that a random group of Americans is an exceptional group of people, facing an impossible circumstance. They comforted their loved ones by phone, braced each other for action and defeated the designs of evil. These Americans were brave, strong and united in ways that shocked the terrorists but should not surprise any of us. This is the nation we know. And whenever we need hope and inspiration, we can look to the skies and remember. God bless.\\nNorth Carolina\\'s highest court has ruled that felony offenders who are out of prison and registered to vote in North Carolina during a roughly 10-day period thanks to a recent order by trial judges will remain on voting rolls for now RALEIGH, N.C. -- Certain felons released from prison or never incarcerated and who registered to vote recently in North Carolina will remain eligible as litigation over their right to vote continues, the states highest court has ruled. The state Supreme Court, in a lawsuit challenging when North Carolina residents convicted of felonies have their voting rights restored, essentially declined to reinstate a order last month that declared any offender no longer behind bars could register. That order would have affected about 56,000 people who were still serving probation, parole or other supervision, according to court records. On Sept. 3, the state Court of Appeals blocked last months trial order amid pending litigation filed by civil rights groups and ex-offenders challenging state law on the restoration of voting rights. Those plaintiffs immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, which late Friday declined to block the Court of Appeals order, but also declared it would be implemented only going forward. That means a felony offender who registered between Aug. 23 and Sept. 3 -- when the trial judges\\' order was in place and based solely on that order -- can\\'t be removed from voting rolls and \"are legally registered voters\" until told otherwise, the Supreme Court wrote. So those offenders who registered will be able to vote in this fall\\'s municipal elections. Early in-person voting for October elections begins Thursday. It wasn\\'t immediately known how many people who qualified under the Sept. 23 order actually registered. Plaintiffs in the 2019 lawsuit that led to the orders and appeals said Friday\\'s ruling was disappointing but urged those who registered to cast ballots. The lawsuit contends current state law on restoring voting rights is racially discriminatory by disproportionately affecting Black offenders and violates the state constitution. \"We are now a step closer to our goal, and even in the face of this temporary delay of full justice, we are celebrating,\" the plaintiff organizations said in a news release Saturday. \"We remain committed to the vision of an equal democracy, untainted by laws illegally designed to disenfranchise Black people in this state.\" State Republican legislative leaders, some of whom are named defendants in the lawsuit along with the State Board of Elections, have said the trial court went too far with its expansive order so close to an election. \"The Supreme Court made the right call,\" Sen. Warren Daniel, a Burke County Republican and co-chairman of the Senate elections committee, said on Saturday. \"A judge cannot just write a new law because he or she doesnt like the old one.\" The order was signed by Associate Justice Tamara Barringer on behalf of the court, which is composed of four registered Democrats and three Republicans. There was no legal explanation for the decision. The North Carolina Constitution forbids a person convicted of a felony from voting \"unless that person shall be first restored to the rights of citizenship in the manner prescribed by law.\" A 1973 law laying out those restoration rules requires the \"unconditional discharge of an inmate, of a probationer, or of a parolee.\" But the Aug. 23 order had said election officials couldnt deny voter registration to any convicted felon who is only on probation, parole or post-release supervision. A plaintiffs attorney said last month the trial courts decision would represent the largest expansion of North Carolina voting rights since the 1960s. There are more than 7.1 million registered voters in North Carolina. Democrats were in charge of the legislature when the law, which lowered hurdles for ex-felons to vote, was approved. The GOP defendants said there\\'s no evidence the law is carried out today in a racially discriminatory manner. Last year, trial judges ruled felony offenders couldnt be denied the right to vote if the reason their rights hadnt been restored was due to unpaid fines or restitution. The Supreme Court said on Friday that rule remains in effect.\\nThe U.S. Capitol Police is recommending disciplinary action in six cases stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Capitol Police said Saturday it has recommended disciplinary action in six cases after an internal review of officer behavior stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The department\\'s Office of Professional Responsibility opened 38 internal investigations and was able to identify 26 of the officers involved, the police said in a statement. It said in 20 of the cases, no wrongdoing was found. However, the police said \"violations were sustained and disciplinary action was recommended\" for six of the cases -- including three for \"conduct unbecoming,\" one for failure to comply with directions, one for \"improper remarks\" and one for \"improper dissemination of information.\" It was unclear in the statement whether a case was an individual officer or if an officer could be cited in more than one case. Names of the officers involved and details about the behavior or actions that led to the alleged violations were not made public. The statement also said the U.S. attorneys office did not find sufficient evidence that any of the officers committed a crime. More than 600 people face charges in the Jan. 6 attack, in which a mob loyal to then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, battled police and tried to stop the certification of the election victory for President Joe Biden. The statement said an internal review of one other case is pending of an official accused of \"unsatisfactory performance and conduct unbecoming.\" It said that internal investigation started after a criminal investigation, and no charges were filed. Five people died in the Capitol attack and its aftermath, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by police. A police officer who battled the mob died later, and several officers later took their own lives. This week, the USCP provided the information to the Justice Department as part of its ongoing prosecution of those involved in the Jan. 6 attack. The police opened the internal investigation in February, and announced at the time it was suspending six officers with pay. Whether they were among those recommended for discipline was unclear in the statement. The department said the six cases \"should not diminish the heroic efforts\" of the Capitol Police on Jan. 6.\\n\"I think it\\'s a terrible shame. Anybody could have been hurt.\" A Catholic high school student was killed and another teenager was injured when gunfire erupted at a popular Halloween hayride attraction in a Pittsburgh suburb, and police said the suspected gunman remained on the run Monday. The shooting unfolded around 8:15 p.m. Saturday at the Haunted Hills Hayride, about 13 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, according to the Allegheny County State Police. Police said gunfire broke out near the ticket booth about 15 minutes before the annual charity event was set to open for the first night in a run scheduled to go through Halloween. Up to 100 people, including parents and children, were waiting to get into the event when multiple shots were fired, sparking a chaotic scene of people scrambling to get out of harm\\'s way, according to police. Lt. Venerando Costa of the Allegheny County Police Department said at a news conference that two 15-year-old boys were shot and taken to an area hospital, where one was pronounced dead and the other was initially in critical condition. The boy killed was identified as Steven Eason of Wilmerding, Pennsylvania, according to an Allegheny County medical examiner\\'s office. Eason was shot in the chest and stomach when he and his friends witnessed the other shooting victim, who they casually knew, involved in a confrontation with the gunman and attempted to intervene, Allegheny County Police said in a statement. The second victim, the boy Eason tried to help, was shot in the shoulder and was in stable condition on Monday, police said. The wounded teenager\\'s name was not released. Costa said witnesses described the suspected gunman as Black, 15 to 17 years old, 5 foot 9, with short hair and wearing dark blue cargo shorts and carrying a black backpack. Costa told ABC News on Monday morning that investigators are still working to identify the gunman and asked anyone with information on the suspect to call the police. Witnesses said the suspect fled toward the parking lot but it was unclear if he left the scene on foot or in a vehicle, police said. No other injuries were reported. Eason was a sophomore at Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, school officials said in a post on Facebook. \"It is with deep sorrow that we share with you news of the sudden and unexpected death of Steven Eason,\" school officials said in a statement, adding that counselors will be made available to students this week. \"What goes through my mind when a 15-year-old gets shot at a hayride? I think it\\'s a terrible shame,\" Costa said. \"Anybody could have been hurt.\" The Haunted Hills Hayride, which also features a haunted trail lined with actors dressed in Halloween costumes, is an annual charity event to benefit the Autism Society of Pittsburgh.\\nThree people have been arrested for allegedly carrying out a mass shooting that injured seven, including a 3-year-old child, in southern Illinois. Three suspects opened fire near 6th Street and Martin Luther King Drive in East St. Louis, Illinois around 4 p.m. Thursday, police said. In the chaotic shooting, Illinois State Police (ISP) said that one of the shooting victims was a 25-year-old man who crashed the car he was driving into a MetroLink train. No passengers on the train were injured. The seven shooting victims were transported to area hospitals and their conditions are unknown at this time, according to the press release. Police identified the victims as a 49-year-old male of Belleville, Illinois; a 24-year-old male of East St. Louis, Illinois; a 53-year-old male of East St. Louis, Illinois; a 53-year-old male of Belleville, Illinois; and a 38-year-old female of St. Louis, Missouri, in addition to the 25-year-old car driver from East St. Louis. A 3-year-old boy was hit in the rampage and was taken to the East St. Louis Police Department by his guardian, authorities said. From there, agents from the ISP Public Safety Enforcement Group transported him to an area hospital while performing life-saving measures. Witnesses reported seeing three men fleeing the scene with weapons and a manhunt was launched for the assailants, police said. Three suspects were found at 2:30 a.m. Friday in the basement of a partially demolished building, ISP said in an update. Illinois Police State Police said Friday the suspects were: Deangelo M. Higgs, 35, of East St. Louis, Lorenzo W. Bruce Jr., 32, of Madison, and Cartez R. Beard, 30 of Cahokia, all of Illinois. They\\'ve been charged with one count of felon in possession of a weapon and seven counts of aggravated battery/discharge of a firearm by the St. Clair County state\\'s attorney\\'s office. Lawyer information for the three was not immediately available. \"The response to this shooting is an example of the Illinois State Police bringing to bear all resources at its disposal to bring justice to this community,\" ISP Director Brendan F. Kelly said in a statement. \"PSEG, Patrol, SWAT, Air Ops and all ISP personnel again demonstrated our ongoing commitment to protecting the people of East St. Louis.\" On Friday, East St. Louis Police Chief Kendall Perry said the shooting wasn\\'t random and was targeted, however a motive remains unknown at this time. \"They had a target. I don\\'t know what their motive was, but they weren\\'t shooting just randomly,\" Perry said, The Associated Press reported. Stephen Pierce was waiting for a bus with his wife and two children when he said he heard shots fired, describing it as \"boom, boom boom,\" according to local CBS affiliate in St. Louis, Missouri, KMOV. His wife was wounded in the arm, he said. \"Our backs were turned and the next thing you know they just started shooting and it came at the back of my head and I didn\\'t know what to do but to get up and run,\" Pierce told the outlet. East St. Louis Mayor Robert Eastern III announced a curfew at midnight Friday into 6 a.m. that will last indefinitely to stop criminal activity in wake of the shooting, he announced in a press conference Friday.\\nConservative activists in Nebraska are turning to voters to enact a voter identification requirement, an issue that state lawmakers have blocked multiple times even though it\\'s now common in other Republican-led states OMAHA, Neb. -- State Sen. Mike Groene was frustrated but not terribly surprised last year when Nebraskas Legislature rejected, for the seventh time, a measure that would have forced voters to show a government-issued identification at the polls. The issue is a slam dunk in most conservative states, where Republican majorities simply brush aside Democratic objections to pass more restrictive voting laws. But not in Nebraska, a GOP stronghold whose quirky, nonpartisan Legislature enables more liberal lawmakers to derail bills that are widely supported in a state where Republicans hold every statewide and federal office. \"Its the way the system is set up,\" said Groene, a conservative Republican who supports a voter ID law. \"It isnt designed to address major issues that most of the state wants.\" Now, a campaign bankrolled by the conservative governor\\'s mother is aiming to end Nebraska\\'s distinction as the only GOP state without a voter ID law. The group Citizens for Voter ID is gathering the roughly 125,000 signatures needed to put the issue on the 2022 general election ballot, and even opponents acknowledge the measure probably will pass. The effort is the latest reflection of a polarized political climate that no longer tolerates much variation from the prevailing partisan agenda, regardless of local tradition or circumstances. Although Nebraska\\'s unique nonpartisan, one-chamber legislative system is unlikely to change because it\\'s part of the state constitution, politicians are increasingly willing to work around it. \"I thought it was time to take it to the people,\" said state Sen. Julie Slama, the petition drive\\'s sponsor. Slama acknowledged that Nebraska has no history of voter fraud, but she said constituents in her rural, conservative district wonder why the state doesn\\'t have a measure that\\'s Republican orthodoxy elsewhere. \"It makes us look bad,\" said Doug Kagan, president of the conservative Nebraska Taxpayers for Freedom, which has pushed for voter ID laws. \"Every year, there are more states that pass some kind of voter ID law. Its kind of an anomaly that we havent passed one.\" The campaign has already raised $377,000, with all but $1,000 of that coming from Marlene Ricketts, the mother of GOP Gov. Pete Ricketts and the wife of Joe Ricketts, a billionaire conservative activist. Opponents argue that the goal of voter ID isn\\'t to ensure secure elections but to discourage voting by minorities and others who tend to vote for Democratic candidates. But they acknowledge that Nebraska is likely to remain solidly Republican with or without voter ID. Nebraska is 88% white and backed Donald Trump in the 2020 general election by 19 percentage points over Democrat Joe Biden. Nevertheless, following the party line here probably won\\'t be easy. Since 1937, Nebraska\\'s Legislature, unlike all other states, has been comprised of one chamber and lawmakers have been officially nonpartisan, though party affiliations are widely known. There are no formal caucus meetings where party leaders tell members how to vote; Democrats are sometimes chosen to head committees despite holding only 17 of the 49 seats. Longstanding rules also require a two-thirds vote to overcome a filibuster, meaning supporters of a bill need at least 33 members -- one more seat than Republicans hold. Those rules have helped Democrats beat back numerous bills over the years, including charter school proposals, efforts to end the states practice of splitting up its presidential electoral votes and, of course, voter ID. It leaves Republicans frustrated, but over the years few have tried to change the system, approved by voters at the urging of former U.S. Sen. George Norris, a progressive Republican who argued it would be more responsive to regular people\\'s needs. Some legislators also believe the system encourages cooperation and limits firebrands who want to roll over their opponents. Republican state Sen. John McCollister, of Omaha, has voted against voter identification bills and other bills supported by his party, drawing strong condemnation from GOP officials outside the Legislature, but not from his colleagues. \"I think most of us feel free to be more independent than we would in a state with a party caucus system,\" said McCollister. \"We arent so quick to jump on some of these political exercises that other states have gotten into.\" But the push for ballot measures may grow stronger as other partisan issues get stuck in the Legislature, said Hal Daub, a longtime Republican activist and former congressman and Omaha mayor. Over the last decade, petition drives have allowed Nebraska voters to reinstate the death penalty, expand Medicaid, regulate payday lenders, legalize casino gambling and raise the minimum wage -- all issues where the electorate overruled state lawmakers. \"It\\'s a structural problem that\\'s going to force more of these initiatives,\" said Daub, who donated $1,000 to the voter ID campaign. ------ Follow Grant Schulte on Twitter: https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte\\nSept. 11, 2001, marked the start of a new era for Muslims in the United States. Shortly after al-Qaida terrorists attacked the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, many Muslims, as well as other Arab Americans, became the targets of anger and racism. Mosques were burned or destroyed and death threats and harassment followed many Muslims in the weeks following the attacks, according to congressional testimony from the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2011. Some victims were beaten, attacked or held at gunpoint for merely being perceived as Muslim, the organization said. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who is Muslim, reflected on 9/11 and the discrimination that followed in an interview with ABC News. \"As Americans, as people who are living here, we were also attacked,\" she said. \"This is our community, this is our country, and there were Muslims who lost their lives in those towers, who were Muslim firefighters, who lost their lives.\" She added, \"There is a desire by many to use our faith and our identity as a weapon against us and to \\'other\\' us. That has been really harmful in so many ways.\" Hate crimes against Muslims rose 1617% from 2000 to 2001, according to the FBI marking some of the highest numbers of Islamophobic hate crimes ever in the U.S. But even as the country moved further from the attacks and the Muslim American population in the country grew, discrimination against this community has not waned, Pew Research Center reports. After the 9/11 attacks On Sept. 17, 2001, then-President George W. Bush spoke at the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., to denounce hatred against Muslims amid his vows to \"win the war against terrorism\" in the Middle East. \"  The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam,\" Bush said. \"That\\'s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don\\'t represent peace. They represent evil and war.\" And for the most part, the public agreed with the president -- the Pew Research Center found that 59% of people had favorable views of Muslim-Americans following the attacks, although 40% of the public believe that the terrorists were motivated at least in part by religion. However, those who didn\\'t view Muslims favorably went on the offense. Across the country, reports of bomb threats, arson and assaults against Muslims made headlines. \"In the post-9/11 period, there was a lot of fear about Muslims and terrorism in the United States and so we created all these new opportunities to surveil citizens and harass citizens and even entrap citizens in our desire to fight terrorism,\" said Sally Howell, director of the Center for Arab American Studies at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. As years passed, the number of hate crimes dropped (and then rose again in recent years), according to the FBI, but the damage was done. For years, Muslims in the United States felt unsure about their place in American society, according to the research initiative by the University of California, Berkeley called Islamophobia Research and Documentation Project. \"This for me is one of the saddest pieces in the survey -- we asked people, as a Muslim living in the West, if \\'I feel more strongly insecure and afraid for my family and kids,\\'\" Hatem Bazian, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley and leader of the college\\'s Islamophobia Research and Documentation Project. He said that of the people surveyed, almost 80% said they feel at least somewhat worried about the safety of their family in the U.S. And each election cycle, that uncertainty about their role in American society was exacerbated. Islamophobia became a political tool, with some public figures, like former President Donald Trump and media commentators using the fear against Muslims and Arab Americans to rile up their bases. Islamophobia as a political tool Anti-Muslim rhetoric was used against former President Barack Obama during both of his presidential campaigns, despite the fact that Obama is a Christian. Racist and xenophobic rumors about his religion and about his birthplace were used to stoke outrage and mistrust against Obama, weaponizing pre-existing fear about Muslims. Opponents doubled down on conspiracy theories about Obama concerning his nationality and religion -- falsely claiming that he was ineligible to become the president because he was not born in the U.S., or that he secretly practiced Islam, which would not make him ineligible for the presidency. \"Islamophobia was monetized into votes at the ballot box by projecting Obama as a closet Muslim,\" Bazian said. Anti-Muslim sentiment continued during the 2016 election cycle, during which Islamophobic hate crimes surged again. According to the FBI, there were 481 incidents in 2001, followed by a significant decline in incidents the next year -- 155. In 2015, there were 257 hate crimes against Muslims and 307 in 2016. The number of incidents has declined since then through 2019, the latest year for which data is available. Experts link the rise in hate to the anti-Muslim rhetoric being espoused on the political stage. then-candidate Trump made the Islamic faith and Muslims targets of criticism throughout his presidential campaign including proposing a ban on Muslims entering the country. In November 2015, he made unsubstantiated claims on ABC News that Arab Americans were celebrating the fall of the Twin Towers: \"There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good.\" In March 2016, Trump claimed on CNN that hatred defined the Islam faith, saying \"I think Islam hates us. There\\'s something there that -- there\\'s a tremendous hatred there. There\\'s a tremendous hatred. We have to get to the bottom of it. There\\'s an unbelievable hatred of us.\" During the first months of the Trump administration, the Pew Research Center reported that roughly 75% of Muslim American adults said there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims in the U.S. Shortly into his time in office, Trump signed an executive order that barred immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries in a move that critics say enshrined his anti-Muslim stance into law. While he was a presidential candidate, he called for a complete ban on Muslims entering the United States. The measure was legally challenged until the Supreme Court upheld an amended version of the order in 2018. It affected travelers and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries like Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, and Libya. It also included North Koreans and some Venezuelans, and other nations were added to the list in 2020. From 2017 to 2021, when Biden ended the ban, more than 40,000 people were refused visas because of the executive order, according to U.S. State Department figures. Trump and supporters of the order denied that it was Islamophobic, saying instead that it was protecting the U.S. from terrorism. But advocates say that the order, which is no longer in effect legitimized hatred and fear of Muslims, making life and immigration to the U.S. much harder. \"It takes a long time to undo the effects of these types of messages and these types of campaigns,\" Bazian said. \"Islamophobia is not really about Muslims. It uses Muslims, but it\\'s not about Muslims. It\\'s about the rallying the discomfort of certain pockets of Western society at a time of unsureness.\" Now, Muslim communities across the country are focused on building safe communities and curbing Islamophobia with education and outreach following years of anti-Muslim rhetoric in the White House. Building community and combatting discrimination Despite efforts by some groups to quell this population, Muslims have continued to grow and thrive in the U.S. Muslims have slowly gained representation in the government, in U.S. television and a presence in the public sphere across the country. \"If you look at the Detroit area and the contributions that immigrants from the Muslim world are making to society and the economy -- they\\'re just the bedrock and backbone of so many local industries,\" Howell said. In 2007, the first Muslim member of Congress, Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., was elected. In 2018, voters elected the first Muslim women to hold a seat in Congress: Democratic Reps. Omar and Rashida Tlaib. In an interview, Tlaib told ABC News that her Muslim faith and background helps her understand the harm that can come from Islamophobia and xenophobia. \"We can be there to talk about it and say, \\'no, it didn\\'t work 20 years ago, it\\'s not going to work now. And you\\'re actually making us less safe in your and you\\'re also enabling hate and racism in our country when you target people solely based on their faith,\\'\" Tlaib said. \"I think that\\'s why were so strongly in opposition of the ban on people of Muslim faith into our country and so much more.\" The Muslim population in the U.S. continues to rise and is projected to have grown to 3.85 million people in 2020, according to the Pew Research Center. And as more Muslims continue to cultivate communities across the country, more houses of worship in the U.S. have appeared over the last 20 years as well. The Cooperative Congregational Studies Partnership found 1,209 mosques in the U.S. in 2000 -- and that number more than doubled in 2020, when researchers found at least 2,769 mosques. Islam has been seen in the Western world in a negative light, according to Bazian, who believes this negative portrayal couldn\\'t be further from the truth. He says education is the first step to ridding the faith and its people of this stigma. \"They created this fear that America is being taken over by Muslims,\" Bazian said, recommending training to teachers, human resources and the workplace. \"We have been playing ignorant for some time, so education is still one of the primary tools to counter Islamophobia.\" Most Americans don\\'t know a Muslim, or admit to not knowing anything about Muslims, according to a Pew Research Center survey. \"The public has fairly limited sort of direct knowledge or interaction with Muslims,\" said Dr. Besheer Mohamed, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center. \"People who say they personally know someone who\\'s Muslim, then they have more positive views toward Islam and toward Muslims than people who don\\'t.\" This invisibility, Howell said, is what is giving Islamophobia its power. \"It\\'s important that we understand that because we need to know that Muslims are not outsiders, they\\'re not strangers,\" Howell said. \"When Muslims are visible to non-Muslims through their institutions, through their names, through their headscarves, through the Halal signs on their restaurants, then people would know their co-workers, their neighbors, as Muslims, and this helps overcome whatever you know prejudice or concern they might have.\"\\nRob Vickers of Gulf Breeze, Florida is a third-generation armed services veteran with a father who served in the United States Air Force and a grandfather who was injured while serving in the Army during World War II. \"I volunteered when I was little ... Ive always liked giving back,\" Rob says of his inspiration for joining the United States Marine Corps. Its this selfless pursuit that carved out a future of helping others throughout his career and personal life. Rob joined The Army National Guard in 2000 and one year later, served as a 9/11 first responder at Ground Zero. On Saturday, September 8th, he happened to be in New York City, traveling with a church group and has pictures from the top of the World Trade Centers South Tower. When the unthinkable events unfolded on Tuesday morning 20 years ago, he was called in to assist on the scene. Afterward, Rob joined the Air Force and went on to serve in Iraq and, after a combined 14 years of service, medically retired in 2010. In 2012, Rob and a friend started Emerald Coast Wounded Warriors, advocating for and assisting many local wounded veterans and their families - including those of other 9/11 first responders. As a result, many of the warriors Rob champions for have received free homes, service dogs, emergency mental health care, financial aid, and spaces to safely interact with one another - a critical need for veterans living in isolation during the pandemic. \"Helping others is very therapeutic for me,\" Rob says of the work hes doing with the organization.

During a year of unprecedented change and uncertainty, there were extraordinary accomplishments at the Resort, including the launch of our brand new reimagined Castle of Magical Dreams, the reopening of our park, the introduction of the new Inclusion Key and the debut of our first live outdoor musical stage show Follow Your Dreams. Each milestone was a monumental achievement and so much credit goes to our Disney cast members who have been the true heroes behind the scenes. Check out this special cast video from our 15th anniversary that celebrates some of the years highlights and shares a look at the magic ahead!\\nDo you have a favorite spot at Walt Disney World Resort? I have a running list of places special to me, from the Belle Vue Room Lounge at Disneys BoardWalk, to the France pavilion in World Showcase at EPCOT, and so many more. At the top of my list, though, is the Space Mountain attraction queue in Tomorrowland at Magic Kingdom Park. A Walt Disney dream inspired by the Matterhorn Bobsleds in Disneyland park, Space Mountain was officially announced on Oct. 21, 1972, during a press conference highlighting the second phase of development for Walt Disney World. New attractions, such as Pirates of the Caribbean and the Star Jets (known today as Astro Orbiter), and an expansion of Disneys Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground were in the works. Construction on the mountain would begin soon after. Long-time Walt Disney Imagineer and Disney Legend John Hench provided the conical design. It measures 175 feet tall and 300 feet in diameter. There are 72 beams encircling the sealed cone, each weighing 74 tons and extending 117 feet toward the top. Inside, guests rocket through outer space on an out-of-this-world voyage, all controlled via advanced computer technology. A star-studded grand opening, attended by Mickey Mouse and several NASA astronauts, was held on Jan. 15, 1975. I highly recommend the \"Behind the Attraction\" episode about Space Mountain on Disney+ if youd like to learn even more about this icon found at Disney Parks around the world. I rode the attraction only once with my father when we visited in 1983. During a return family trip five years later, I fell in love. Outer space fascinated me at the time, so the star tunnel queue, with its beautiful music pulsing through the air, was the perfect spot for dreaming about being an astronaut. The beautiful music was composed by then-Imagineer George Wilkins, who had previously worked with Disney Legend Buddy Baker on the soundtrack for EPCOT. Wilkins optimistic Tomorrowland composition, titled \"Weve Come So Far (Promising Tomorrows),\" was introduced during a mid-1980s update to Space Mountain. Variations are still heard today, and I am filled with hope every time I hear the music. In the late 1990s, I discovered the \"Walt Disney World Forever\" kiosks in Disney Springs Marketplace, where guests could create their own CD soundtracks. The first one I made contained the Space Mountain music (\"Star Tunnel\" was on repeat while I wrote this story). As we draw closer to the start of \"The Worlds Most Magical Celebration\" on Oct. 1, its inspiring to look back at how Space Mountain was announced just one year after the grand opening of Walt Disney World. This iconic attraction helped deliver on the promise that Walts Florida dream would continue to grow and evolve into the future, a promise we will continue to celebrate as part of the resorts 50th anniversary. Keep checking back with us here as we cover all the magic happening around this major milestone in our history.\\nAriana Greenblatt from \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"The One and Only Ivan,\" both streaming on Disney+, spent her birthday at the Happiest Place on Earth!

It paid off. While other countries faced overwhelmed hospital systems and devastating death tolls, Australia enjoyed large public gatherings, and life went on as normal for most people within its sealed-off borders. But confronted with rising cases of the delta variant, the Australian government has announced a dramatic shift, planning now to \"live with the virus\" rather than stamp it out entirely. In short, \"Fortress Australia\" has been breached. During a televised briefing last month, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that lockdowns, which in some parts of the country have endured for more than six months, were \"not a sustainable way to live.\" \"This Groundhog Day has to end, and it will end when we start getting to 70% and 80%,\" he said, referring to vaccination rates. Much of the country remains largely COVID-free. But the states of New South Wales and Victoria, home to metropolises Sydney and Melbourne, have posted record numbers of daily infections in recent weeks. Between Sept. 1, 2020, and July 1 of this year, the country recorded fewer than 5,000 coronavirus cases. But since then, total cumulative cases have more than doubled in under three months, from 30,684 to more than 66,000 as the delta variant took hold, according to Our World in Data. \"The reality is that delta is too infectious to be able to eliminate it with the amount of restriction that can be sustained by a population that is already really, really tired of restrictions after having gone through more than 200 days of restriction previously,\" Professor Ivo Mueller, an epidemiologist at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, told ABC News. \"So that, in a sense, forced the hand of the government to accept that we have to go from \\'COVID Zero\\' to \\'living with COVID.\\'\" But internal restrictions in New South Wales and Victoria, as well as heavy restrictions the government has placed on intrastate travel, may endure for some time. The 80% target set by Morrison for vaccinations is unlikely to be achieved by mid-October, according to current trends. As it stands, fewer than 35% of Australians are fully vaccinated, putting the nation among the lowest of OECD countries. Australia is now administering doses at higher rates than peaks seen in the United States, but supply remains an issue. \"Vaccine hesitancy is rare,\" Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales, told ABC News. \"Anti-vaxxers exist here but are rare in Australia. The real problem has been lack of supply. Our authorities have been too slow to acquire sufficient vaccine doses for the young, who were supposed to get Pfizer and then confusion occurred when Pfizer deliveries were stalled.\" This led to intense criticism of the government that it failed to chase vaccines with urgency, as Morrison repeatedly told the public, \"It\\'s not a race.\" Now the Australian government has struck deals with other countries, including Britain and Singapore, to secure Pfizer doses earlier and help end the lockdown sooner. While the government\\'s exit strategy marks a change in approach, some states are showing more eagerness to loosen restrictions. Australians like their freedom, but they aren\\'t willing to have it at the price of many deaths. Aside from domestic border closures between states, citizens in the majority of Australian states are living virtually COVID-free lives, and the idea of opening up their gates may prove unpopular. New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian previously has warned that other states can\\'t continue to live \"in their bubbles\" forever. Berejiklian announced on Thursday that New South Wales, home to Australia\\'s biggest city, Sydney, will ease lockdown restrictions from mid-October, when authorities expect 70% of adults in her state to be vaccinated. At that point, she said, Sydney\\'s restaurants, cafes and pubs can reopen. That\\'s despite infections there lingering at record levels. On Saturday, New South Wales recorded 1,599 cases of COVID-19 -- the highest daily tally since the pandemic began. \"I want to stress that whilst today the New South Wales government is outlining our plan, our roadmap for the way forward in New South Wales, that we\\'re definitely not out of the woods,\" Berejiklian said during a daily briefing. \"We know that case numbers are likely to peak in the next week or so, and we also know that our hospital system will be under the greatest stress in October.\" In Melbourne, residents have tired of over 220 cumulative days of lockdown. Yasmin Vachha, a primary school teacher in the Victorian capital, has been teaching from home for 30 weeks altogether, as the state has gone in and out of lockdowns. She said the experience shows the country is \"not a united front\" and it is increasingly \"hard to see the light.\" \"The kids are flat, motivation is low and you can see it all taking its toll,\" she told ABC News. \"We all have our own lockdown despair happening and it is getting harder by the day. I hate that this is now normal and that we have to be OK with it. How are we still in this position?\" The criticism is not restricted to Australians currently in the country. In March 2020, the government shuttered its international borders, barring most foreigners and putting caps on total arrivals to help keep the virus at bay. As a result, tens of thousands of Australians remain trapped overseas -- around 34,000 registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as being stranded abroad. The actual number who want to return home is likely far higher. Some are deterred at the prospect of returning home by restrictive and expensive quarantine measures, while others can\\'t secure a plane ticket home at all. The policies have separated thousands of families, and led to heartbreaking stories of Australians unable to get home to see terminally ill relatives. Many have been forced to miss weddings, births and funerals. To make matters worse, Australia in July slashed the number of international arrivals by half -- to about 3,000 passengers a week. But in another sign that the Australian government is shifting gears, for the first time since the pandemic started, Morrison on Wednesday acknowledged the frustration that Australian expatriates were going through, and opened up the prospect of families being able to reunite at home for Christmas: \"You have saved lives by enduring and going through those difficulties, so thank you -- I do appreciate it, and your fellow Australians do also.\" Morrison said his government was hard at work to enforce a home quarantine system, to reconnect Australia with the world. There are now also indications that the government will drop a travel ban on Australians leaving the country. The Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, an association of legal professionals, has been pressuring the government to stop its \"bullying\" of Australians living overseas. The internal border restrictions also have led to heartbreak and frustration. According to The Guardian, a New South Wales resident this month has been unable to cross the border for vital cancer treatment in neighboring Queensland due to a compulsory hotel quarantine, and on Father\\'s Day, families separated by border closures hugged across a state boundary which fell through the suburb of Coolangatta in Sydney. A new app is being tested in South Australia that deploys facial recognition technology and cell phone alerts to replace the hotel system. It was described in the Atlantic as \"Orwellian\" in an article that said people would be \"forced to download it,\" but an Australian government source said that terminology was misleading. \"The home quarantine app is for a selected cohort of returning South Australians who have applied to be a part of the trial,\" a government spokesperson said. \"If successful, it will help safely ease the burden of travel restrictions associated with the pandemic.\" The issue of civil liberties under threat has been overblown, according to McLaws. \"While restrictions are tough and we are tired of them, Australians are less obsessed with individual rights during this time,\" she said. \"Australians like their freedom, but they aren\\'t willing to have it at the price of many deaths.\" While the new timeline for opening up society will come as welcome news for those living under some of the world\\'s longest lockdowns, an instantaneous reopening or \"freedom day\" is not on the cards, according to Mueller. The government has observed the high rates of transmission in highly vaccinated countries like the U.S. and U.K., and will continue to adopt a tough approach, he said. \"Eventually, people will come to the point that they want those freedoms back again,\" he said. \"And I think all political leaders and all state leaders do recognize that, and I think also the population in Australia does recognize that they eventually will have to open up and that will mean that the virus will circulate in the population.\" \"Australia,\" he added, \"cannot remain forever an island.\"\\nTropical Storm Nicholas has set a course toward the Gulf Coast and is expected to bring drenching rains to some regions still recovering from Hurricane Ida. The system strengthened from a tropical depression late Sunday morning in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, currently carrying maximum sustained winds up to 40 mph and moving north-northwest at 15 mph. The center of the storm is currently about 300 miles south-southeast from the mouth of the Rio Grande River. Nicholas is expected to become better organized and strengthen as it closes in on the southern Texas coast in the next 24 to 36 hours. Landfall is expected late Monday into early Tuesday morning, but the impact will begin hours earlier. The tropical moisture from the storm is already triggering scattered showers and thunderstorms along the western Gulf Coast Sunday afternoon. Flash flooding along the coast is possible in the next to 12 to 24 hours, and on Monday morning, the center of the storm will be off the northeast coast of Mexico. A tropical storm warning is in effect from the Rio Grande River to Port Aransas, Texas, including cities such as Corpus Christi and South Padre Island. A tropical storm watch is in effect from Port Aransas along the Texas coast to High Island, which includes Galveston and Victoria. Nicholas is the 14th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which is currently at its peak, with five tropical disturbances being monitored across the Atlantic basin. The outer bands of Nicholas could potentially affect some regions along the Louisiana coast that were devastated by Hurricane Ida last month, such as New Orleans. Flash flood watches are now in effect from Brownsville, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana. A storm surge watch has been issued along parts of the Texas coastline as well, with surges between 2 and 4 feet expected. Nicholas is expected to weaken on Tuesday but will also slow down, which could increase the risk of flash flooding. While the winds will die down, the heavy rain will continue and crawl over east Texas through the middle of the week. The primary widespread hazard from Nicholas will be the heavy rain and flash flood threats. Rounds of heavy rain will slam much of the Texas and Louisiana coast over the next few days. Between 6 and 10 inches of rain is forecast for Galveston, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana. The Houston metro area could see between 2 to 4 inches, which higher amounts closer to the coast. South of Lake Charles, 10 to 15 inches is possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResearchers in Germany have potty trained cows, all in the name of science Turns out cows can be potty trained as easily as toddlers. Maybe easier. It\\'s no bull. Scientists put the task to the test and 11 out of 16 cows learned to use the \"MooLoo\" when they had to go. Just like some parents, the researchers used a sweet treat to coax the cows to push through a gate and urinate in a special pen. And it took only 15 days to train the young calves. Some kids take quite a bit longer. \"The cows are at least as good as children, age 2 to 4 years, at least as quick,\" said study senior author Lindsay Matthews, an animal behavioral scientist at New Zealand\\'s University of Auckland who worked with colleagues on the tests at an indoor animal research lab in Germany. What started with a half-in-jest question on a New Zealand radio talk show about the very real problem of livestock waste resulted in a serious study published Monday in the journal Current Biology. And it wasn\\'t just a \"wow, this could be fun\" academic question. Massive amounts of urine waste is a serious environmental issue, Matthews said. Urine contains nitrogen, and when mixed with feces becomes ammonia, which is an environmental issue with acid rain and other problems, Matthews said. It can also taint the water with nitrates and create the airborne pollutant nitrous oxide, he said. And cows do pee a lot. A single cow can produce about 8 gallons (30 liters) of urine a day, Matthews said. In 2019, nitrous oxide comprised 7% of all the U.S. greenhouse gases, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. \"I am not surprised they can train calves to urinate in set locations, but I am surprised no one has demonstrated this before,\" said Duke University animal cognition scientist Brian Hare, who wasnt part of the research. \"The critical question is can it and will it scale?\" If it could be done, toilet training animals makes it easier to manage waste products and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, said Donald Broom, a professor of animal welfare at the University of Cambridge in England. At the lab is Dummerstorf, Germany, the researchers mimicked a toddler\\'s training, putting the cows in the special pen, waiting until they urinated and then giving them a reward: a sweet liquid of mostly molasses. Cows do have a sweet tooth, Matthews said. If the cows urinated outside the MooLoo after the initial training, they got a squirt of cold water. Then in two sets of experiments, the researchers let the Holstein cows roam about the indoor facility. When they had to urinate, 11 of them pushed into the pen, did their business, and got their sweet reward. There are a couple caveats to this experiment. No. 1, they gave diuretics to the cattle to get them to urinate more because they had limited time to run the experiments under ethics guidelines. And No. 2, they didnt do No. 2. They only trained cows to use the MooLoo to urinate, not defecate. Urine is a bigger problem, at least in Europe, Matthews said. But he predicted they could train cows to poop in a certain place too. While dogs, cats and horses can be toilet trained, they already show the desire to go in special places, but cows dont, Matthews said. The biggest environmental problem for livestock, though, is the heat-trapping gas methane they emit in belches and flatulence, a significant source of global warming. The cows cant be trained not to belch or fart, Matthews said: \"They would blow up.\" ------ ------ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Republican Rep. Mark Samsel also agreed not to use social media for personal purposes or have any contact with the high school student who said he was kicked and another another student who complained of an interaction with Samsel. The lawmaker also agreed to write letters of apology to both students. Samsel had faced three misdemeanor criminal charges of battery following what the local prosecutor described as \"rude, insulting or angry\" interactions with two students, during an April 28 art class at the high school in his hometown of Wellsville, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City. One student told a sheriffs deputy that Samsel had manhandled him and kicked him, according to an affidavit from the deputy. Both students were identified only by initials in court documents; both were born in 2005, making them 15 or 16. The lawmaker said in a Facebook post last month that \"extreme\" stress caused him to have \"an isolated episode of mania with psychotic features\" in a classroom. He disclosed that he was undergoing mental health treatment and surrendered his state substitute teacher\\'s license. \"I just want to say I\\'m sorry for what happened,\" Samsel said during an 12-minute district-court hearing. \"I never intended to hurt anybody.\" But Mary Woods, whose niece had a class with Samsel the same day, said Samsel should have received time in jail. \"He laid his hands on a kid,\" Woods told The Kansas City Star. \"He traumatized a lot of these kids.\" Kansas law says disorderly conduct includes \"engaging in noisy conduct tending reasonably to arouse alarm, anger or resentment in others.\" It is a lesser charge than battery, with a maximum sentence of 30 days in a county jail and a fine of up to $500. The battery charge carried a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000. During a Zoom hearing, Franklin County Magistrate Judge Kevin Kimball sentenced Samsel to serve a total of 90 days in jail on the three disorderly conduct charges but suspended that sentence in favor of probation. He also ordered Samsel to pay $263 in costs associated with his arrest and court case. County prosecutor Brandon Jones did not immediately return a telephone message Monday afternoon seeking comment, and his office said he was in court for other cases. Videos shot by students on April 28 and provided by a parent showed Samsel talking about suicide, God and sex in a noisy classroom. According to the deputys affidavit, Samsel said he only \"demonstrated a kick\" for one boy who had disrupted class but did not kick him. The deputy also wrote that Samsel said God told him to do what he did. Samsel, a 36-year-old attorney who has served in the House since 2019, has said that he was trying to make a point about mental health issues and the need for people to be kinder to one another. \"Im glad to see Rep. Samsel taking responsibility for his actions and getting the help he needs,\" Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr. said in an email to The Associated Press. The House\\'s top Democrat, Minority Leader Tom Sawyer, said in a statement that he hopes Samsel continues to get mental health treatment but also, \"I want to express my condolences to the victims of his behavior.\" Kimball in May ordered Samsel to undergo a mental health evaluation, and the resulting report remains under seal. Samsel said in his Facebook post that he suffered from \"extreme stress, pressure, and agitation over a sustained period of time,\" with the worst of it during April and May, when lawmakers were wrapping up their business for the year. He also said in the Facebook post that he was studying ways to handle stress so that \"there is no likelihood\" an episode will occur again. \"He\\'s very sorry for his actions,\" said Samsel\\'s attorney, Christopher Scott. \"If he could go back to that day, he would handle it differently.\" ------ Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna\\nWalmart denied any partnership with the digital currency Litecoin after a fake news release briefly tripped up several national news outlets and social media users on Monday NEW YORK -- Walmart denied any partnership with the digital currency Litecoin after a fake news release led to a brief flurry of inaccurate reports from national news outlets and social media users on Monday. A news release claiming a partnership between Walmart and Litecoin is \"not real,\" according to Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman. Charlie Lee, creator of Litecoin and managing director of the Litecoin Foundation, confirmed the release was fake. The false announcement was temporarily featured on a major press release wire and in outlets including Reuters, CNBC and Yahoo Finance, before being deleted and corrected. It wasnt immediately clear who created it. Here\\'s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: Walmart on Monday announced a major partnership with the digital currency Litecoin. THE FACTS: The nations largest retailer is not partnering with Litecoin, despite a bogus news release claiming as much, Blakeman told The Associated Press by phone. Walmart added in a statement on its website that it \"has no relationship with Litecoin.\" Lee, who created Litecoin, confirmed the release was fake in an email to the AP. A Litecoin employee mistakenly tweeted the false claim on Monday from the currency\\'s verified account after seeing the bogus announcement on GlobeNewswire, a major distributor of news releases, Lee explained. The employee later realized his error and deleted the tweet, Lee said. The release touted the false headline \"Walmart Announces Major Partnership With Litecoin.\" It fabricated quotes from Walmart\\'s CEO and the creator of Litecoin to falsely claim Walmart would allow customers to pay with the digital currency starting Oct. 1. Though this announcement is fake, Walmart is looking to hire an expert in digital currencies and blockchain, Blakeman said. The false news release briefly tripped up national news outlets, Twitter users and cryptocurrency buyers. The price of Litecoin jumped from about $175 early Monday to about $233 within seconds of the press release being published. The price fell just as fast a few minutes later. GlobeNewswire, which briefly featured the release on its site before removing it, is conducting an investigation into what happened, said Dave Pleiss, vice president of investor and public relations for Intrado, which owns the press release wire. \"This has never happened before and we have already put in place enhanced authentication steps to prevent this isolated incident from occurring in the future,\" Pleiss said.

President Joe Biden is helping him get there -- and also hoping that Newsom helps him out along the way. The president will campaign alongside Newsom Monday in Long Beach, the day before voting ends in a recall effort that was emboldened by backlash to COVID-19 restrictions, but that might be decided by backlash to that backlash. Just like recall proponents have used anger over mandates and shutdowns as an argument to replace the governor, Democrats are using COVID-19 as a case in point for why Newsom should stay. Newsom\\'s campaign has juiced ballot returns with concerns that a Republican governor would, as Newsom said last week, \"walk us off that same COVID cliff\" as GOP-led states like Texas and Florida. The leading Republican replacement candidate, Larry Elder, has promised to roll back vaccine and mask mandates immediately if he is sworn in. Biden touches down in California having just unveiled sweeping federal vaccination mandates that reach deep into the private sector. Those moves brought outrage among conservatives, including some 19 Republican governors vowing to challenge his authority, in court or the court of public opinion. On that point, Biden and Newsom are both counting on a vocal minority getting drowned out and outvoted by a broad majority that doesn\\'t want more backsliding in fighting the pandemic. California may make for an imperfect test case, but lessons learned there will carry into other races in 2021 and 2022. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper Senate Democrats don\\'t have their house in order when it comes to the $3.5 trillion Democrats-only \"human\" infrastructure plan and it\\'s a predicament that could tank both the budget reconciliation and the smaller bipartisan infrastructure deal passed by the Senate last month. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who has thrown a wrench in much of the Biden agenda, has called for a \"strategic pause\" on the budget reconciliation plan that would allow Democrats to go it alone without Republican support. With a 50-50 Senate, Democrats need to be in lockstep to see it through and Manchin has made it clear he isn\\'t with the rest of his party on this. Democratic leaders in both chambers of Congress have rejected Manchin\\'s \"strategic pause.\" \"The urgency -- I can\\'t understand why we can\\'t take time to deliberate on this and work,\" Manchin told ABC \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. In the House, some Democrats have threatened to delay the passage of the bipartisan plan until the reconciliation plan is passed. Senate Budget committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., warned that the ongoing divide could leave Americans without desperately needed infrastructure improvements. \"I think we\\'re gonna work it out, but it would really be a terrible, terrible shame for the American people if both bills went down,\" Sanders told Stephanopoulos Sunday. The Senate is back in session on Monday and the tentative deadline for Senate committees to turn in a draft of the legislation is Wednesday. The TIP with Meg Cunningham Although polls for California\\'s recall election do not close until Tuesday night, some Republicans are preparing for issues with election integrity based on lies about the 2020 presidential election. Trump has already claimed that the election is \"probably rigged.\" And Elder, the leading Republican to potentially succeed Newsom, warned of \"shenanigans\" last week -- though he told ABC News Saturday, \"So many people are going to vote to have it recalled, I\\'m not worried about fraud.\" Elder had previously said that he believed President Joe Biden won the 2020 election \"fairly and squarely.\" But he is now encouraging his supporters to call a hotline to report issues of voter fraud for litigation purposes in the recall, saying he fears there will be integrity issues similar to those of the 2020 election -- despite there being no widespread evidence of voter fraud in November. \"We\\'re going to file lawsuits in a timely fashion,\" Elder said last week. The California GOP also has a network of lawyers standing by. \"I don\\'t know if there is fraud or not,\" the party chairwoman told the Los Angeles Times. \"We are not messing around.\" THE PLAYLIST ABC News\\' \"Start Here\" podcast.

Gavin Newsom from office in stark terms LONG BEACH, Calif. -- President Joe Biden put Democrats approach to the coronavirus pandemic on the line Monday, casting the California recall that could remove Gov. Gavin Newsom from office as an opportunity for voters to show the nation that \"leadership matters, science matters.\" \"The eyes of the nation are on California because the decision youre going to make isn\\'t just going to have a huge impact on California, its going to reverberate around the nation, and quite frankly, not a joke, around the world,\" the Democratic president said at a rally in the Southern California city of Long Beach. The closing pitch from Newsom and his most prominent Democratic ally came a night before voting concludes in the race that could remove the first-term governor from office. He is just the fourth governor in U.S. history and the second in California to face a recall. Californians removed Democratic Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 and replaced him with Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. Bidens appearance underscored the importance to Democrats of keeping the governors office in the nations most populous state, where many progressive policies originate. Newsom and other prominent Democrats have cast the race as a battle The results of the race ending Tuesday will send signals about how voters are poised to react to Democrats who adopted aggressive pandemic policies in next years midterm elections, when control of Congress and half the nations governorships are at stake. \"Gavin will be a governor who will help us finish the job,\" Biden said, regarding the pandemic. Just a half hour south from where Biden spoke, Republican front-runner and talk radio host Larry Elder was urging his supporters not to let up on getting out the vote among fellow Republicans, friends and neighbors in the races final 24 hours. The party needs a strong Election Day showing to catch up to Democrats who performed better in early voting, mostly by mail. Nearly 8 million Californians already have cast mail-in ballots. \"Make sure you have your friends vote, vote, vote, and try and get 10 more friends to vote and hit every call, make every call, knock on every door, were gonna win this thing if we turn out the vote,\" Elder said from a hotel ballroom in the Orange County city of Costa Mesa. He then went through his standard stump speech of what he deems Newsom\\'s failures on public education, water and wildfires, and crime. Newsom has likened Elder as a California-version of former Republican President Donald Trump, branding him as in some ways even \"more extreme.\" Biden echoed that note, referring to Elder not by name but as \"the closest thing to a Trump clone Ive ever seen.\" Biden handily won California, though Trump earned more than 6 million votes in the state. California has more than 22 million registered voters. California Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson called it \"baffling and insulting\" that Biden engaged in a political event when some Californians remain stuck in Afghanistan. \"Its clear protecting those they were elected to serve comes second to politics,\" she said in a statement. Amateur Republican political organizers upset with Newsoms approach to crime, homelessness and immigration launched the recall drive in early 2020, but the coronavirus pandemic got it to the ballot. Newsom was the first governor in the country to issue a statewide stay-at-home order that shuttered many businesses for months and kept kids out of classrooms. \"Theres no front that I can think of where this man has done a good job -- not on schools, not on homelessness, not in the way he shut down this state,\" Elder said earlier Monday. Voters are being asked two questions: Should Newsom be recalled, yes or no, and who should replace him? The results of the second question only matter if a majority wants to remove Newsom. Recent polls from the Public Policy Institute of California and others showed Newsom defeating the recall. Lead recall organizer Orrin Heatlie said neither Biden nor Trump should be weighing in on the contest because it\\'s about California issues. Meanwhile, he said Trump\\'s statement Monday calling the election rigged risks diminishing Republican turnout. \"When people aren\\'t confident, if they don\\'t have faith that their vote is going to count, then they\\'re not going to waste their time to cast their ballot,\" Heatlie said. There has been no confirmed evidence of widespread fraud. Elder\\'s campaign website links to a website called \"Stop CA Fraud\" where people can sign a petition demanding a special election to investigate the election, even though the election hasn\\'t concluded. Before the rally, Biden toured wildfire damage in Northern California. He praised Newsom\\'s leadership on responding to climate change, which is contributing to California\\'s wildfires becoming bigger and more destructive. Elder and Republicans say Democratic leaders have failed to appropriately manage California\\'s forests, leaving more fuel for fires to burn through. Other prominent candidates in the race are Republicans Kevin Faulconer, Kevin Kiley and John Cox, and Democrat Kevin Paffrath. ------ Ronayne reported from Sacramento. Associated Press journalist Alexandra Jaffe contributed from Long Beach. ------ Catch up with AP\\'s recall coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/california-recall\\nNobody said suing a prince would be easy. The question of whether Britain\\'s Prince Andrew has been officially and lawfully served with notice of Virginia Giuffre\\'s sexual assault lawsuit against him remains unresolved, following a 30-minute telephonic conference in front of U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the Southern District of New York. Giuffre\\'s attorney, David Boies, told the court: \"We have properly served him.\" Citing his firm\\'s efforts to deliver a summons to the prince in person, through the mail and with the assistance of British judicial officials, Boies said, \"It is clear that Prince Andrew has actual notice of this complaint and proceeding.\" Appearing for the first time as counsel for Prince Andrew, Los Angeles-based attorney Andrew Brettler disagreed. \"We do contest the validity of service to date. The duke has not been properly served under either U.K. law or pursuant to The Hague Convention,\" Brettler said. The Court has given the parties a few weeks to hash out arguments about whether proper service has been achieved and scheduled a hearing on the subject for Oct. 13. But Kaplan made it abundantly clear that he\\'s likely to eventually order an alternative method of service on the prince, if he decides that what has happened so far isn\\'t enough. \"I\\'ll tell you right now that there is going to be ... service authorized appropriately, because I have a foreign national who has been sued in the United States court, and he\\'s taking the position that he hasn\\'t been served,\" Kaplan said in response to Brettler\\'s arguments. \"You have a pretty high degree of certainty that he can be served sooner or later,\" Kaplan added. \"Let\\'s cut out all the technicalities and get to the substance.\" An alleged victim of deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Giuffre, 38, filed the lawsuit against Prince Andrew last month, accusing the embattled 61-year-old royal of sexually abusing her at Epstein\\'s Manhattan mansion and elsewhere in 2001, when she was under the age of 18, according to the complaint. Prince Andrew has denied her allegations, telling the BBC in a 2019 interview that he had no recollection of ever meeting her and that he never had any sexual contact with her. Just hours before the scheduled hearing Monday afternoon, it was unclear if any lawyer would show up to argue for the prince, but Brettler filed a notice of appearance with the court just before noon. Brettler used some of his time during the hearing to assail Giuffre\\'s case as a \"baseless, non-viable and potentially unlawful lawsuit that the plaintiff has filed against the duke.\" Brettler brought up a 2009 settlement agreement Giuffre signed with Epstein that the prince\\'s team contends \"releases the duke and others from any and all potential liability.\" Kaplan abruptly cut Brettler off and said he wanted to confine the discussion at the hearing to the issue of serving notice of the lawsuit. \"This is not an occasion for a different kind of discussion,\" Kaplan said. But as the hearing neared its conclusion, the duke\\'s new counsel raised the issue again, asking that Boies provide the prince\\'s lawyers with a copy of the agreement, which has been filed under seal in parallel litigation involving Giuffre and famed criminal defense attorney Alan Dershowitz. \"We\\'re asking for a copy of the document that we believe absolves our client from any and all liability. Mr. Boies is aware of this. His client is aware of this,\" Brettler said. Boies disputed Brettler\\'s characterization of the settlement agreement and argued that a request for pre-trial discovery at this stage of the proceedings is premature. Three days after Giuffre filed the suit against Prince Andrew, she agreed to drop a battery claim from her long-running defamation lawsuit against Dershowitz, who formerly represented Epstein. The agreement came after Dershowitz asserted that Giuffre\\'s confidential settlement with Epstein barred her from suing him for alleged battery. Giuffre has alleged in court filings that she was sexually abused on multiple occasions by Dershowitz, who was among a group of high-profile lawyers who -- years later, in 2008 -- represented Epstein during the negotiations that led to his so-called \"sweetheart\" deal with U.S. federal prosecutors. Giuffre\\'s withdrawal of the battery claim was described in a joint court filing last month by lawyers for Giuffre and Dershowitz as \"a compromise\" that should not be viewed as an admission by either party of the validity or invalidity of the claims about the settlement agreement. Dershowitz has vigorously denied Giuffre\\'s allegations and counter-sued her for defamation, vowing to prove in court that she lied about him and other prominent men. Last week, Dershowitz\\'s attorney sought permission from the judge overseeing his case to allow him to provide Prince Andrew\\'s lawyers with a copy of Giuffre\\'s confidential settlement agreement with Epstein. \"There is no legitimate justification for blocking the disclosure of the release to Prince Andrew,\" wrote a lawyer for Dershowitz in a letter to the court last week. Giuffre is represented by a separate law firm, Cooper and Kirk, in her case involving Dershowitz, which continues on the competing defamation claims. In a heavily redacted court filing late Monday in the Dershowitz litigation, Giuffre\\'s attorney, Charles Cooper, objected to a potential unsealing of the confidential document and noted that attorneys for Epstein\\'s estate had also refused to consent to its disclosure. Boies told ABC News last week that there \"is no evidence there that Prince Andrew was intended to be covered by the release. And, indeed, Prince Andrew has never himself asserted that he was intended to be covered by the release,\" he said. Kaplan said the decision about whether to unseal the settlement agreement belongs to another judge and suggested that attorneys for Giuffre and Prince Andrew can avoid unnecessary delay by trying to work that issue out privately. \"There is a very swift way of getting to the substance promptly,\" Kaplan said. \"But you two need to talk about that, because I can see a lot of legal fees being spent and time being expended and delay, which ultimately may not be terribly productive for anyone.\" The court in the defamation case has not yet ruled on Dershowitz\\'s request.\\nLouisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are under flash flood watches. Nicholas is stalling over the Gulf Coast, dropping dangerous amounts of rain over areas still recovering from previous storms. Flash flood watches are in effect through Friday in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Ten to 11 inches of rain has already inundated Alabama and Mississippi with more rain on the way. The heaviest rain will be from Mississippi to Alabama to Florida over the next 24 hours. New Orleans will continue to see showers and a few thunderstorms with another 1 to 2 inches of rain possible. Slow-moving Nicholas is an especially dangerous threat for Louisiana, which is still recovering from deadly Hurricane Ida and other devastating storms in 2021 and 2020. As of Tuesday, about 87,000 customers in Louisiana were still without power from Hurricane Ida, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said. Over 1,000 Louisiana residents remain at shelters in the wake of Ida, he said Tuesday. The governor requested an emergency federal declaration, which was granted by President Joe Biden. Before heading to Louisiana, Nicholas first struck the Houston area with over 6 inches of rain, shuttering schools. In the Houston area, 460,000 customers were without power at the height of the storm early Tuesday, according to CenterPoint Energy. About 300,000 customers saw their power return by Tuesday evening.\\nQuestions swirl about strike the U.S. military says prevented an attack in Kabul The U.S. military continues to review the Aug. 29 drone strike in Kabul that it said prevented a car bomb attack on U.S. troops and Afghan civilians at the airport in Kabul, but new questions continue to be raised about the strike in the wake of New York Times interviews with residents and relatives that indicate the driver targeted in the missile strike may have been a worker for an American aid agency. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby would not address specific questions about the drone strike but confirmed that U.S. Central Command is conducting an assessment of that drone strike. However, it appeared that the CENTCOM assessment might not include sending American investigators into Kabul to get first-hand accounts from neighbors and families. \"I\\'m not going to get ahead of what CENTCOM is doing with their assessment of that strike,\" Kirby said at a Pentagon news briefing. \"I am not aware of any option that would put investigators on the ground in Kabul to complete their assessment.\" Kirby said the air strike had prevented an imminent attack at the airport \"and nothing\\'s changed about that view.\" \"I have nothing to speak today that alters the view, CENTCOM is conducting our assessment, and I think we need to let them finish that work,\" said Kirby. \"We\\'ll be as transparent as we can at the end of it, but I have no additional context to offer today.\" The drone strike occurred days after the deadly suicide bombing at the airport, blamed on ISIS-Khorasan. Thirteen American service members and 170 Afghan civilians were killed. It came at a time when U.S. officials were on high alert that another ISIS-K attack at the airport was imminent. Accordingly, on Aug. 29, the movements of a white sedan were tracked for hours by U.S. military drones after it left a known ISIS-K safe house and it made its way through various Kabul neighborhoods, according to the New York Times. The car\\'s movements raised suspicions that it was the vehicle intended to be used in a car bomb attack, as described in ISIS communications intercepted by U.S. intelligence. After the car\\'s driver parked the vehicle in a residential courtyard, he and another man were spotted loading what appeared to be explosives into the vehicle a U.S. official told ABC News. That action led military commanders to order that the drone fire a Hellfire missile at the vehicle to prevent what appeared to be the last steps before a car bomb attack on the airport. U.S. Central Command later said in a statement that it was aware of reports that as many as 10 civilians may have been killed in the strike that it said had \"disrupted an imminent ISIS-K threat to the airport.\" \"We know that there were substantial and powerful subsequent explosions resulting from the destruction of the vehicle, indicating a large amount of explosive material inside that may have caused additional casualties,\" said the statement. \"It is unclear what may have happened, and we are investigating further.\" The New York Times reported on Friday that interviews with neighbors and relatives indicated that the driver of the vehicle was not affiliated with ISIS but worked for Nutrition and Education International, a California-based NGO. Additional information suggested the driver had been transporting colleagues to and from work and that an analysis of a security feed showed what the U.S. military interpreted as the loading of explosives may have in fact been the loading of canisters of water to bring home to his family, according to the newspaper. Asked about the driver\\'s potential links to the NGO, Kirby said he was \"not going to get ahead of Central Command\\'s assessment of this airstrike. \" \"I think I need to let them complete their work,\" he added. \"As I said earlier, the strike was taken to prevent an imminent threat to the airport.\" Days after the drone strike Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had labeled the strike as \"righteous\" because it had followed protocols intended to prevent civilian casualties. \"We had very good intelligence that ISIS-K was preparing a specific-type vehicle at a specific-type location,\" Milley said at a Pentagon briefing on Sept. 1. \"We monitored that through various means, and all of the engagement criteria were being met,\" said Milley. \"We went through the same level of rigor that we\\'ve done for years, and we took a strike.\" \"Because there were secondary explosions, there\\'s a reasonable conclusion to be made that there was explosives in that vehicle,\" said Milley. \"We know from a variety of other means that at least one of those people that were killed was an ISIS facilitator,\" said Milley. \"So were there others killed? Yes, there are others killed. Who they are we don\\'t know. We\\'ll try to sort through all that. But we believe that the procedures at this point -- I don\\'t want to influence the outcome of an investigation -- but at this point, we think that the procedures were correctly followed, and it was a righteous strike.\" At a hearing on Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that no other country comes close to matching the precautions the United States does to minimize civilian casualties. Blinken said the drone strike \"is being looked at very, very carefully by others in the administration so we understand exactly what happened or didn\\'t happen.\" \"We know that in the past, civilians have been hurt and killed in these strikes,\" said Blinken. \"And we have to make sure we have in place every possible measure to allow us to continue to use the tool to defend ourselves while avoiding anyone on the civilian side from being hit. ABC News\\' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.\\nJustice Stephen Breyer said Tuesday the Supreme Courts recent 5-4 decision allowing Texas to effectively ban abortion across the state was \"very bad\" but not politically motivated. \"We dont trade votes, and members of the court have different judicial philosophies,\" Breyer, the courts most senior liberal justice, told George Stephanopoulos on ABC\\'s \"Good Morning America.\" \"Some emphasize more text. ... Some, like me, probably emphasize more purposes. And the great divisions are probably much more along those lines than what we would think of as political lines,\" Breyer said. \"I thought that was a very bad decision and I dissented,\" he said. The courts denial of the request from Texas abortion providers to temporarily put state law SB8 on hold also drew sharp criticism from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote in dissent that the court chose to \"ignore its constitutional obligations ... the sanctity of its precedents and of the rule of law.\" Breyer explained that \"a rule of law means you sometimes follow decisions you dont like.\" The 83-year-old justice has published a new book -- \"The Authority of the Court and the Peril of Politics\" -- defending the Supreme Court as a nonpartisan institution whose power depends on credibility among Americans of all viewpoints. \"Thats a treasure, and its been built up over many many years,\" Breyer told Stephanopoulos. \"I am worried if people dont understand it,\" he said, \"they wont have trust in our institutions. And if they dont have trust in institutions, it becomes difficult if not impossible to live in a society of 331 million people of tremendous diversity.\" Breyer, the courts oldest member, has come under intense pressure from progressives to step down while Democrats control the Senate and White House. He told GMA that he is thinking about retirement but has not yet made a decision on timing. \"There are many different considerations,\" Breyer said. \"I do not intend to die there on the court; I hope not.\"\\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., had more to say Tuesday defending herself against backlash sparked by her controversial Met Gala gown emblazoned with the words \"Tax the Rich,\" after saying Monday night she intended to carry the message into a wealthy space and borrowed the dress because \"while the Met is known for its spectacle, we should have a conversation about it.\" The New York congresswoman dominated talk about the gala on social media, with people calling her a hypocrite for wearing her economic justice message on the back of a fancy dress while attending a charity event attended by New York and Hollywood elites with tickets that cost $35,000 a pop. Republicans on social media questioned why Ocasio-Cortez would attend an event for societys elite if she wants to tax the rich. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said in a tweet Tuesday that Ocasio-Cortez \"wants to tax the rich but took time out of her busy schedule to hob knob with NY and Hollywood elites who paid $30k to attend the #MetGala (and deduct it from their taxes).\" Larry Elder, the conservative talk radio host running against Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in Californias recall election, tweeted the headline of an article about Ocasio-Cortezs dress with the accompanying hashtag \"#WeveGotACountryToSave.\" Floridas GOP Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez also took to Twitter Monday night saying, \"Only in America where a self-described Democratic socialist can wear a $10k \"tax the rich\" dress, pay $30k for a ticket, and be praised as a champion for the poor. Champagne socialists like AOC are far removed from reality.\" Ocasio-Cortez was quick to respond, explaining on social media that New York City elected officials are often invited to the gala and attend \"due to our responsibilities in overseeing our citys cultural institutions that serve the public\" -- pointing out that she was one of several of the citys politicians in attendance. New York City\\'s Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio and Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., were also present at the annual event, which was canceled last year due to the coronavirus. Ocasio-Cortez responded Tuesday on her Instagram story saying she thought about the criticism she would receive and that her body has been \"policed from all corners politically\" since she was elected to Congress. \"But we all had a conversation about Taxing the Rich in front of the very people who lobby against it,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on her Instagram story. \"I am so used to doing the same exact thing that men do -- including popular male progressive elected officials -- and getting a completely different response.\" Ocasio-Cortez also made note on her Instagram account that the dress was borrowed from designer Aurora James, who attended the gala along with the congresswoman. James is the founder of Brother Vellies, a clothing brand focused on traditional African designs and sustainability, and the 15 Percent Pledge, a nonprofit that challenges major retailers to commit a minimum of 15% of their shelf space to Black-owned businesses, according to their respective websites. In an interview during Vogues livestream of the gala, Ocasio-Cortez and James explained the idea behind the controversial dress. \"We really started having a conversation about what it means to be working class women of color at the Met, and we said, \\'We cant just play along, but we need to break the fourth wall and challenge some of the institutions,\\'\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"And while the Met is known for its spectacle, we should have a conversation about it.\" Ocasio-Cortez, on Instagram, said, \"The time is now for childcare, healthcare, and climate action for all. Tax the Rich.\" On CNN Tuesday morning, James reiterated that the concept behind the gown was to bring the message of economic justice to a gathering of the wealthy. \"The Met Gala is obviously one of the most exclusive events in the world, and we wanted to come and deliver a message. And I think when we talk about inclusion and gaining access to closed rooms for people of color, when you finally get a seat at the table you have to decide what the message is that you want to deliver,\" James said. \"I think for the congresswoman, I think for myself, economic equality and economic justice is sort of top of mind.\"\\nIt comes as a wave of voting restrictions have passed in GOP-led states. Senate Democrats on Tuesday introduced their latest version of a sweeping election reform bill to counter the record-number of voting restrictions that have passed in GOP-led states, which they say make it harder for minorities and low-income Americans to cast a ballot. The modified bill, now known as The Freedom to Vote Act, is a compromise after the previous For The People Act failed to pass in the Senate last June. Significantly, the new bill was crafted by a group that included moderate Sen Joe Manchin, a key swing vote, after he opposed an earlier version of the legislation charging that it was too broad and lacked bipartisan support. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., promised a vote on the bill next week, most likely a procedural vote to break an expected GOP filibuster. \"This is a good proposal. One that nobody in this chamber should oppose,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday morning. \"My colleague Sen. Manchin is working with Republicans to secure support for the bill and we look forward to hearing what changes they might make on legislation.\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had a different take. \"Seemingly every few weeks, Democrats take another run at this. This week\\'s latest \\'compromise\\' is just a compromise between the left and the far left. It\\'s the product of Washington Democrats negotiating with each other about how much power they should grab. It contains many of the same fatal flaws as their previous attempted takeovers that have already fallen flat,\" McConnell said. \"These are fake solutions in search of a problem,\" added McConnell, noting that Republicans \"will not be letting Washington Democrats abuse their razor-thin majorities in both chambers to overrule state and local governments and appoint themselves a national Board of Elections on steroids.\" Changes in the newly negotiated election reform bill. The new bill still encompasses sweeping election law changes, from voter ID requirements, expanded early voting, making Election Day a national holiday, banning partisan gerrymandering, and implementing election security and campaign finance measures. But among the provisions dropped or changed is the automatic mailing of ballots. Under the new measure, any voter may request a mail-in ballot but they are not sent out automatically. The legislation will continue to allow voter roll purges but requires changes to be \"done on the basis of reliable and objective evidence and prohibits the use of returned mail sent by third parties to remove voters.\" The bill would also no longer implement public financing of presidential and congressional elections. Still, there are a number of election security provisions, including mandatory, nationwide use of machines that deliver paper ballots. In an attempt to address Republican states that passed changes giving partisan officials a say in election outcomes following President Donald Trump\\'s false allegation that the 2020 presidential election was \"stolen,\" Senate Democrats have proposed in the bill establishing \"federal protections to insulate nonpartisan state and local officials who administer federal elections from undue partisan interference or control.\" \"The fact of the matter is that this legislation is critical for stopping some of the most egregious assaults against voting rights happening at the state level. A few weeks ago, the governor of Texas signed one of the most sweeping voter suppression bills in the entire country,\" Schumer said. Voting rights advocates have praised the bill and are urging the Senate to pass the legislation. \"The Freedom to Vote Act is a very strong bill. It gives powerful new momentum to the fight to protect democracy. It should be passed, and soon,\" said Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law. \"There is now no substitute for action. As redistricting unfolds across the country, time is of the essence. Lawmakers from both parties should embrace this new legislation, and will do so if they are serious about protecting democracy,\" he added. It is unclear if this bill would garner the support of many Republicans, though Manchin has been talking to fellow moderate Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. The Minority blocked the Democrats\\' first stab at the bill claiming it was a solution in search of a problem and maintaining that election administration is the province of states -- not the federal government. Yet, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who does not believe elections should be federalized, signaled there are provisions in the latest bill she could support. \"He sent me a very high-level summary last week which they read, but it does not have many of the details fleshed out. There are two provisions in that if they\\'re done correctly I would support. One is the disclosure of contributors to dark money groups, but it has to apply to all of them,\" Collins said. Ten Republicans would be needed to overcome the chamber\\'s filibuster rule requiring 60 votes for most legislation. To modify that rule, all 50 Democrats would need to be on board with changing Senate rules to allow the legislation to pass on a simple majority vote -- with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie -- but Manchin has point blank refused to support such an extraordinary move. \"The filibuster is permanent,\" Manchin told ABC News when pressed on a voting rights specific carve-out. At this point, it appears there is not likely to be enough GOP support to pass the measure, though Manchin said he\\'s continuing conversations with Murkowski and that the Senate has \"made some good strides\" finding compromise. \"We made some major changes from the original position we\\'re taking and we\\'ve got something that makes a lot of sense,\" Manchin told ABC News\\' Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott on Tuesday. \"I\\'m anxious to go talk to all my Republican friends, which I\\'ve been doing, giving the outline of what we\\'re trying to change and see if there\\'s a filibuster,\" he added. ABC News\\' Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.\\nIt was the president\\'s first trip to the West since taking office. President Joe Biden on Monday made his first visit to the West Coast as president, surveying wildfire damage and pushing for action on combatting climate change. Biden first stopped in Boise, Idaho, to visit the National Interagency Fire Center -- which coordinates the federal government\\'s response to wildfires -- before traveling to the Sacramento, California, area to view the impact of the Caldor Fire and receive a briefing from local officials. The president has used recent natural disasters to show the urgency of climate change and its deadly effects on the American people, pitching his massive spending plan as a way to rebuild infrastructure in a greener, cleaner, more resilient manner. He also used the trip as a way to shore up support for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat facing a recall election Tuesday. Newsom appeared alongside Biden at his stops in California, thanking the president for making climate change a priority. After flying over damage in northern California, Biden spoke of the devastation -- \"homes, precious memories destroyed\" -- and called the more frequent and extreme wildfires \"a blinking code red for our nation.\" \"We can\\'t ignore the reality that these wildfires are being supercharged by climate change,\" he said. \"It isn\\'t about red or blue states; it\\'s about fires, just fires.\" The president said Americans need to face the reality that times have changed. \"From the Yellowstone fire to today, all\\'s changed, in a drastic, drastic way,\" Biden said while meeting with officials in Boise, referring to the 1988 fires that at the time prompted the largest-ever firefighting response in U.S. history. \"It\\'s changed, It\\'s not going back. It\\'s not going back.\" Earlier this month, the president visited Louisiana, New Jersey and New York to see the impact of Hurricane Ida and its remnants. The White House and Democratic leaders in Congress hope to pass two major bills by the end of the month that, together, would make hundreds of billions of dollars available for developing clean energy, rebuilding physical infrastructure to make it withstand more extreme weather events, and electrifying the federal fleet of vehicles. \"My message to you is, when we build back, we have to build back better,\" Biden said, using a slogan he has used to describe his agenda. \"It\\'s not a Democrat thing, it\\'s not a Republican thing. It\\'s a weather thing. It\\'s a reality.\" The larger bill -- the price tag and contents of which have been subject to Democratic infighting -- would devote $135 billion to preventing wildfires, dealing with droughts and promoting clean energy in rural communities, among other things. In California, Biden explained that the $3.5 trillion would be spent over 10 years and would represent a small fraction of the size of the United States\\' gross domestic product. \"We have to think big,\" he said. \"Thinking small is a prescription for disaster. We\\'re going to get this done. This nation is going to come together, and we are going to beat this climate change.\" While in Idaho, Biden toured the federal fire center and promoted his administration\\'s use of the Defense Production Act, a 1950 law that allows the president to direct civilian businesses to help meet orders for products necessary for the national defense, to spur the production of firehoses. The use of the act enabled an Oklahoma City-based nonprofit, which is the main supplier of the U.S. Forest Service\\'s firehoses, to produce 415 miles of fire hose, according to a person familiar with Biden\\'s remarks. Biden said he was able to \"restart production ... bringing a lot of people back to work, delivering 21,920 new feet of firehose at the frontlines.\" He then traveled to Long Beach, California, to speak at a Monday evening campaign rally with Newsom.

Fauci told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that he was not disappointed by the panel\\'s decision and he thinks the process worked. \"The goal of this particular decision was to prevent people from getting serious disease who are at risk, such as the elderly and those that have underlying conditions,\" he said. When pressed whether the president\\'s premature announcement would confuse Americans, Fauci said that people need to understand that such decisions depend on science and approvals by the appropriate health agencies. \"The plan was that we have to be ready to do this as soon as the decision is made and when you have a plan, you put a date on it and you say we want to be able to get ready to roll out on the week of September the 20th,\" he said. \"So giving that date, I don\\'t think was confusing.\" -ABC News\\' Julia Cherner\\nThe youth feels a sense of \"institutional betrayal\" brought on by their leaders. Children and young people around the world are experiencing increasing anxiety over the fate of the planet -- specifically climate change and how lawmakers are handling the looming crisis, according to new research. Scientists who surveyed 10,000 young people, ages 16 to 25, across 10 countries, found \"widespread psychological distress\" among them, and, for the first time, discovered that the anxiety was significantly related to perceived government inaction, according to a study published Tuesday in Lancet Planetary Health. Nearly half of all young people surveyed, more than 45%, said their feelings about climate change negatively affect their daily life and functioning, according to the study. Another 75% of those surveyed said they feel the future is frightening, while 64% said governments are not doing enough to avoid a climate catastrophe. Of the young people surveyed, 58% said governments are betraying hem, while 61% said governments are not protecting them, the planet or future generations. The study is the largest to ever research climate anxiety among children and young people and is the first to investigate how government action on climate change is related to widespread psychological distress among the youngest members of society, according to the authors. \"Climate change has significant implications for the health and futures of children and young people, yet they have little power to limit its harm, making them vulnerable to increased climate anxiety,\" according to the researchers. The results of the study were not surprising and indicate a lack of trust toward the government as well as the perception of institutional betrayal, Lisa Van Susteren, a general and forensic psychiatrist and co-author of the study, told ABC News. The findings are also \"as much a measure\" of climate denial among adults as they are a measure of kids\\' anxiety, Van Susteren said. \"Kids are very media savvy. They\\'re not living in a cave,\" Van Susteren said. \"They have heard about what the future looks like. They\\'ve heard the warnings.\" Scientists warned of the dire situation the planet faces in the annual Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released last month. \"This report tells us that recent changes in the climate are widespread, rapid and intensifying, unprecedented in thousands of years,\" said IPCC Vice Chair Ko Barrett, senior climate adviser for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Young people have been at the forefront of the climate fight for some years -- with 18-year-old activist Greta Thunberg becoming a household name in 2018, and hundreds of thousands of young people around the world taking part in an organized global climate strike in 2019. As an expert witness, Van Susteren performed psychological evaluations on the young people who were plaintiffs in Juliana V. United States, the 2015 federal lawsuit brought about by 21 youths who accused the government of failing to adequately combat climate change. She described it as \"one of the most difficult experiences\" in her career. \"You can clearly see that theirs depths of despair just are off the charts and are in part attributed to the sense that the future holds little promise,\" Van Susteren said. The case was dismissed in January 2020, but lawyers representing the plaintiffs filed a motion in March to amend their complaint. The case is now pending in U.S. District Court, awaiting a ruling on that motion. The researchers concluded that climate change and inadequate governmental response are associated with climate anxiety and distress in children and young people globally. Continued government inaction on climate change could lead to a public health crisis among the youth, the researchers warned. Van Susteren described a \"healing effect\" that could take place if lawmakers and industry professionals were to do \"the right thing\" to significantly curb greenhouse gas emissions. \"They\\'re not going to heal with words alone,\" she said. \"They\\'re going to heal because of actions that are taken.\"\\nPolice said the man was armed with a bayonet and a machete. United States Capitol Police said Monday they arrested a man in a truck who was armed with multiple knives, a bayonet and a machete near the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington. A Special Operation Division Officer noticed a Dodge Dakota pickup truck with a swastika and other white supremacist symbols painted on it while on patrol around midnight outside of the DNC, according to a press release from U.S. Capitol Police. The truck allegedly had a picture of an American flag where the license plate should have been. Capitol Police say Donald Craighead, a 44-year-old man from California told them \"he was \"on patrol\" and began talking about white supremacist ideology and other rhetoric pertaining to white supremacy.\" He was arrested on prohibited weapons charges. \"This is good police work plain and simple,\" said Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger. \"We applaud the officers\\' keen observation and the teamwork that resulted in this arrest.\" It is unclear if he was attempting to attend any upcoming demonstrations, Capitol Police said. The development comes as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a briefing for lawmakers from U.S. Capitol Police on Monday concerning ongoing security threats ahead of a planned demonstration at the Capitol on Saturday in support of those arrested during the Jan. 6 attack. Fencing outside U.S. Capitol is expected to return ahead of the \"Justice for J6\" rally, a source familiar with the plans confirmed to ABC News. The fencing, erected after Jan. 6, was removed in July.\\nThe Justice Department is curtailing federal agents use of \"no-knock\" warrants -- which allow law enforcement agents to enter a home without announcing their presence -- and would also prohibit its agents from using chokeholds in most circumstances WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said Tuesday it is curtailing federal agents use of \"no-knock\" warrants -- which allow law enforcement agents to enter a home without announcing their presence -- and would also prohibit its agents from using chokeholds in most circumstances. The updated policy follows the March 2020 death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in her home during a no-knock warrant and whose death led to months of mass protests over racial injustice in policing and the treatment of Black people in the United States. A no-knock warrant, as its name implies, is an order from a judge that allows police to enter a home without prior notification to the residents, such as ringing a doorbell or banging on the door. In most cases, the law requires that officers must knock and announce themselves before entering a private home to execute a search warrant. But the Justice Departments new policy, enacted by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco on Tuesday, is more limiting than what is permitted by law. And obtaining such a warrant would require approval from both federal prosecutors and a supervisory law enforcement agent. Under the updated policy, federal agents would be limited to using a no-knock warrant only in situations when an agent \"has reasonable grounds to believe that knocking and announcing the agents presence would create an imminent threat of physical violence to the agent and/or another person.\" There are limited exceptions to that rule, but agents seeking a warrant in those circumstances would need approval from the agencys director and the U.S. attorney or an assistant attorney general before seeking the warrant from a judge. There have been growing calls to ban no-knock warrants since Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical worker, was killed in her Louisville, Kentucky, home by officers. She was shot multiple times after being roused from her bed by police during a no-knock warrant as part of a drug investigation. Taylor\\'s boyfriend was in the apartment and fired at police because he heard banging on the door but thought it might be an intruder, he said. Louisville police have said they announced themselves at the door, though some witnesses have disputed that. No drugs were found, and the warrant was later found to be flawed. Police generally seek a no-knock warrant if the situation might be extraordinarily dangerous or if a suspect is likely to destroy evidence when police knock on the door. But critics have said their use has increased dramatically in recent years and some departments use them routinely in cases that dont merit such an exception. \"As members of federal law enforcement, we have a shared obligation to lead by example in a way that engenders the trust and confidence of the communities we serve,\" Monaco said. The Justice Departments new policies also prohibit the use of chokeholds and \"carotid restraints\" unless the situation allows for the use of deadly force by police. Several states have prohibited or severely limited the use of chokeholds and neck restraints by police officers since the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video pleading for air as a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyds neck. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of murder and manslaughter in state court, and he and other officers also face federal criminal charges. ---- AP reporter Dylan Lovan contributed to this report.\\nFour former Minneapolis police officers involved in the death of George Floyd pleaded not guilty to charges in federal court Tuesday. Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao have been charged with violating Floyds constitutional rights in ways that \"resulted in bodily injury to, and the death of, George Floyd,\" according to the federal grand jury indictment. The hearing may address some of the pretrial motions, including requests from Lane, Kueng and Thao asking to separate their cases from Chauvin\\'s. Chauvin was convicted in Floyd\\'s murder in April 2021 and his fellow ex-officers argue that they would not get a fair trial if connected to Chauvin. Floyd was killed in May 2020 when he was placed under arrest on the suspicion that he was using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a convenience store. Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd\\'s neck for more than nine minutes. He was sentenced to 22 and-a-half-years in prison. Judge Peter Cahill rejected Chauvin\\'s request for a new trial in June. The federal indictment accuses Chauvin, Thao, Kueng and Lane of depriving Floyd of his rights when they witnessed him \"in clear need\" of medical care but instead \"willfully failed to aid Floyd.\" Thao and Kueng are charged with violating Floyds right to be free from unreasonable seizure. All four officers are also charged with depriving Floyd of his rights when they failed to provide him with medical care. The officers acted \"with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm,\" the indictment said. Lane, Kueng and Thao also face a state trial on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter and have entered not guilty pleas on those charges as well. While Chauvin kneeled on Floyd\\'s neck at times during the arrest, Kueng kneeled on his back and Lane held down Floyds legs, according to evidence presented in state court. Thao blocked bystanders from getting involved. The indictment also accuses Chauvin of violating Floyd\\'s right to be free from unreasonable seizure or force by a law enforcement officer. Following Chauvin\\'s murder conviction, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the Justice Department has opened a pattern or practice investigation into the City of Minneapolis. The Minneapolis Police Department said it would investigate unconstitutional or unlawful policing in the city.\\nSupreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett is expressing concerns that the public may increasingly see the court as a partisan institution LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett expressed concerns Sunday that the public may increasingly see the court as a partisan institution. Justices must be \"hyper vigilant to make sure theyre not letting personal biases creep into their decisions, since judges are people, too,\" Barrett said at a lecture hosted by the University of Louisvilles McConnell Center. Introduced by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who founded the center and played a key role in pushing through her confirmation in the last days of the Trump administration, Barrett spoke at length about her desire for others to see the Supreme Court as nonpartisan. Barrett said the medias reporting of opinions doesnt capture the deliberative process in reaching those decisions. And she insisted that \"judicial philosophies are not the same as political parties.\" \"To say the courts reasoning is flawed is different from saying the court is acting in a partisan manner,\" said Barrett, whose confirmation to the seat left open by the death of the liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg cemented conservative control of the court. \"I think we need to evaluate what the court is doing on its own terms.\" Barrett\\'s comments followed a high-profile decision earlier this month in which the court by 5-4 vote declined to step in to stop a Texas law banning most abortions from going into effect, prompting outrage from abortion rights groups and President Joe Biden. Barrett was asked about that decision by students who submitted questions in advance and also asked about another recent decision by the court in which it refused to block a lower court ruling ordering the Biden administration to reinstate a Trump-era program informally known as Remain in Mexico. Barrett said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment on specific cases. Several supporters of abortion rights demonstrated outside the Seelbach Hotel, where the private event was held. Barrett, 49, also spoke about her introduction to the court in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, saying it \"certainly is a different experience.\" The court has for more than a year been hearing arguments by telephone though it recently announced a return to the courtroom in October. Barrett described the court as a \"warm, collegial place.\" She said that after she was confirmed a colleague brought Halloween candy for her children. The first mother of school-age children on the nine-member court also spoke about balancing her job and family life. \"I have an important job, but I certainly am no more important than anyone else in the grocery store checkout line,\" Barrett said, describing how her relationship with her children -- who are not \"particularly impressed\" with her high-profile post -- helps her stay grounded in her \"regular life\" where she is busy \"running carpools, throwing birthday parties, being ordered around.\" When asked what advice she would give to young women who would like to pursue a career in public service, the justice said she would like young women to know it is possible to raise a family and be successful. Barrett was confirmed by the Senate in a 52-48 vote last year, a little over a month after Ginsburg\\'s death. Democrats opposed her nomination, arguing that the process was rushed and that the winner of the 2020 presidential election should have been able to choose Ginsburg\\'s replacement. McConnells decision to move forward with Barrett\\'s nomination was a contrast to the position he took in 2016, when he refused to consider President Barack Obamas choice to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of that year. McConnell blocked hearings for then-judge Merrick Garland, now Bidens attorney general, saying the choice should be left to voters in an election year. The lecture was held in celebration of the McConnell Center\\'s 30th anniversary. Founded in 1991, the nonpartisan center provides educational and scholarship opportunities to students at the University of Louisville. Three other Supreme Court Justices, most recently Justice Neil Gorsuch, have spoken at the center. ------ Hudspeth Blackburn is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Colombo crime family boss Andrew \"Mush\" Russo, underboss Benji Castellazzo and consigliere Ralph DiMatteo were among 14 purported mobsters charged Tuesday with labor racketeering, extortion and money laundering. Ten members of the Colombo crime family and one member of the Bonanno crime family were arrested, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Most of the alleged mobsters were arrested in New York and New Jersey on Tuesday, while Colombo captain Vincent Ricciardo was arrested in North Carolina. DiMatteo, 66, remains at large. Russo and Castellazzo are allegedly long-time members of the family, at 87 and 83 years old, respectively. The charges describe what federal prosecutors in Brooklyn called \"a long-standing, ruthless pattern\" of exerting control over a labor union by threatening to harm its leaders unless they selected vendors for contracts who were on the take. The defendants also tried to force the union and its affiliated health care fund to divert more than $10,000 per month to the Colombo family, prosecutors said. The indictment quoted Ricciardo threatening to kill someone labeled John Doe #1 if he did not comply. In a June 21 recording, Ricciardo allegedly explained that John Doe #1 knows, \"I\\'ll put him in the ground right in front of his wife and kids, right in front of his f------ house, you laugh all you want pal, I\\'m not afraid to go to jail, let me tell you something, to prove a point? I would f------ shoot him right in front of his wife and kids, call the police, f--- it, let me go, how long you think I\\'m gonna last anyway?\" Ricciardo and his cousin had allegedly been collecting part of John Doe\\'s salary since 2001 before broadening extortion efforts in 2019, according to the DOJ. The 75-year-old Ricciardo, known as Vinny Unions, is already a convicted felon and was shot in the back in November 1992 when masked men ambushed a car he was riding in on the way to a wake, according to The New York Times. One of the other people in the car was killed, and another survived after being shot eight times. \"Everything we allege in this investigation proves history does indeed repeat itself. The underbelly of the crime families in New York City is alive and well. These soldiers, consiglieres, under bosses, and bosses are obviously not students of history, and don\\'t seem to comprehend that we\\'re going to catch them,\" FBI Assistant Director Michael Driscoll said in a statement. One of those arrested, Teddy Persico Jr., was on federal supervised release from a previous racketeering conviction, authorities said. Also arrested was purported Bonanno organized crime family soldier John Ragano, who allegedly falsified paperwork at safety training schools saying workers had completed Occupational Safety and Health Administration classes when they had not. Ragano\\'s schools were actually fronts for meetings of the La Cosa Nostra crime family and used to store illegal drugs and fireworks, according to the indictment. Ragano, 59, was allegedly known by the nickname \"Maniac.\" The defendants could each face up to 20 years in jail, according to the DOJ. ABC News\\' Mark Osborne contributed to this report.\\nCalifornians may be the only ones that can vote in Tuesday\\'s recall election, but in his closing arguments for Gov. Gavin Newsom, President Joe Biden warned that the country\\'s political future is on the ballot. \"This is not hyperbole. The eyes of the nation are on California because the decision you\\'re about to make isn\\'t just going to have a huge impact on California, it\\'s going to reverberate around the nation, and quite frankly, not a joke, around the world,\" Biden stressed. Biden rallied alongside Newsom Monday, first traveling to survey the fire damage from the Caldor Fire, then to Long Beach, California, to make one final pitch to voters. His support for Newsom comes after a slew of top Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, traveled to the Golden State to campaign for the embattled governor. On the eve of his recall election, Newsom main argument was one focused on Trumpism. \"We may have defeated Donald Trump, but we have not defeated Trumpism,\" he said. \"Trumpism is still on the ballot in California and that\\'s why it\\'s so important, not just for all of us here at 40 million Americans strong in the nation\\'s largest and most populous state, but also to send a statement, all across the United States of America, that Trumpism isn\\'t ... has no place here.\" It was a theme that Biden picked up, calling Republican front-runner Larry Elder a \"clone of Donald Trump.\" \"This is the closest thing to a Trump clone that I\\'ve ever seen in your state. Now I really mean it. And he\\'s leading the other team. He\\'s a clone of Donald Trump ... you can\\'t let that happen. There\\'s too much at stake,\" he said. \"You either keep Gavin Newsom as your governor, or you\\'ll get Donald Trump,\" Biden continued. While both speeches largely focused on making comparisons between Elder and the former president, Biden did praise Newsom on many of his policies, such as Newsom\\'s handling of the pandemic -- which is one of the main reasons the recall effort took off. \"We don\\'t need politics in this battle against COVID. We need science. We need courage. We need leadership. We need Gavin Newsom. The governor will follow science. He\\'s got the courage to do it right now,\" Biden said. In another effort to nationalize the recall, Biden pointed to other states to warn voters of what could happen should Newsom be replaced. \"Do you have any doubt about how important it is to have Gavin, who respects women\\'s rights? Just take a look at what\\'s happening to states like Texas,\" Biden said. \"It just passed a law empowering complete strangers ... become bounty hunters, going after women who exercise their right to choose. A law the United States Supreme Court refused to stop. Now other states say they\\'re looking to replicate the Texas law. You don\\'t think women\\'s rights are under assault? You\\'re not looking.\" In Tuesday\\'s election, voters will be asked two questions: Should Newsom be recalled? And if so, who should replace him? At least 50% of voters will have to vote no on Tuesday\\'s recall in order for Newsom to keep his job. As election day gets closer, Newsom\\'s job security is looking better, as 57.3% of voters say they\\'ll vote no, according to FiveThirtyEight\\'s polling average. While Newsom\\'s team has expressed confidence in his ability to make it though Tuesday\\'s recall, his ally, Biden, wrapped up his remarks Monday night with a stark warning: it\\'s not over yet. \"You have a governor to make sure Donald Trump\\'s dark, destructive divisive politics never finds a place in California. So please -- not a joke -- on behalf of the people of Delaware, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, all across America, don\\'t take anything for granted,\" the president said. Although Californians will make their voices heard at the ballot box, candidates on both sides are warning of potential legal challenges that could follow. Elder, who would not say if he would accept the results of Tuesday\\'s election in an interview with ABC News\\' Zohreen Shah, has already started making claims of fraud. On his campaign website, Elder has linked to a \"Stop CA Fraud\" page where voters can report fraud. While no votes have been calculated yet, the page already claims: \"Statistical analyses used to detect in elections held in 3rd world nations...have detected fraud in California resulting in Governor Gavin Newsom being reinstated as governor.\" Jonathan Mehta Stein, executive director of California Common Cause, a nonpartisan, liberal-leaning political advocacy organization, told ABC News that such claims should be expected. \"There will inevitably be claims that the election is rigged because the purveyors of the \\'big lie\\' need these local and state elections in between the major national elections to keep up their momentum; but all of their allegations in the November 2020 election fell flat,\" Stein said. \"There\\'s nothing new under the sun here. And we assume that there will be lawsuits filed after the recall and they will be treated the same way as the lawsuits in the 2020 election.\" Stein said misinformation in the recall could also undermine and limit turnout among the voters that those who are sowing the misinformation are trying to reach. But such misinformation, he said, has \"no basis in the realities of California\\'s election administration, which has been stress-tested repeatedly and proven to be some of the most secure, most reliable elections in the nation.\" That reliability will be put to the test Tuesday in an election with profound national consequences. ABC News\\' Oren Oppenheim contributed to this report.\\nATLANTA -- The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday announced a statewide civil rights investigation into Georgia prisons, citing particular concern about violence. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who oversees the department\\'s civil rights division, said the investigation will be comprehensive but will focus on \"harm to prisoners resulting from prisoner-on-prisoner violence.\" It will also look into sexual abuse of gay, lesbian and transgender prisoners by both prisoners and staff. \"Under the Eighth Amendment of our Constitution, those who have been convicted of crimes and sentenced to serve time in prisons must never be subjected to cruel and unusual punishments,\" Clarke said during a video news conference. \"We must ensure the inherent human dignity and worth of everyone, including people who are incarcerated.\" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp\\'s office referred a request for comment on the investigation to the state Department of Corrections. \"The GDC is committed to the safety of all of the offenders in its custody and denies that it has engaged in a pattern or practice of violating their civil rights or failing to protect them from harm due to violence,\" Corrections spokeswoman Lori Benoit said in an email. \"This commitment includes the protection of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) prisoners from sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and sexual assault.\" If the investigation reveals reasonable cause to believe there is a systemic constitutional violation, the Justice Department will provide written notice of any violations, along with supporting facts and minimal remedial measures, Clarke said. She added that the department would work with the state to establish solutions. Clarke said the Justice Department is committed to trying to address the effects of prison staff shortages, inadequate policies and training and the lack of accountability. Understaffing is a particularly devastating problem, Clarke said, noting that it can lead to inadequate supervision and violence. It can also keep people from being able to get necessary medical and mental health care. Without adequate mental health care, people experiencing mental health issues may harm themselves or commit suicide, risks that are compounded if they\\'re locked up and isolated in solitary confinement, she said. The Justice Department\\'s investigation was prompted by an extensive review of publicly available data and other information, Clarke said. Among the things considered, she said, were concerns raised by citizens, family members of people in prison and civil rights groups, as well as photos and videos that have leaked out of the state\\'s prisons that have \"highlighted widespread contraband weapons and open gang activity in the prisons.\" Clarke pointed to at least 26 deaths in Georgia prisons by confirmed or suspected homicide as well as a reported 18 homicides so far this year in Georgia prisons. She said there have also been reports of other violent acts, including stabbings and beatings. People of color are disproportionately represented among the nation\\'s prison population, Clarke said, adding that Black people make up 61% percent of the people held in Georgia prisons but only about 32% of the state\\'s population. She also said investigators would continue a current investigation into whether Georgia adequately protects lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people held in prisons from sexual abuse by other prisoners and staff. The Justice Department in April filed a brief in a lawsuit filed by a transgender woman held in a men\\'s prison in Georgia. The department didn\\'t take a position on the facts of the case but said the Constitution requires prison officials to keep transgender people reasonably safe from substantial risk of harm and provide them with adequate medical care. Sara Totonchi, executive director of the Southern Center for Human Rights, which on Friday filed a lawsuit challenging the solitary confinement conditions at a Georgia prison, said she is grateful for Justice Department intervention. \"While this is a first step, it is an incredibly significant one in our struggle for accountability and safety inside Georgia prisons,\" she said, adding that she\\'s been involved in advocacy work around prisons for two decades. \"In my 20 years, I have never seen the prisons in such crisis. I have never seen this level of violence, of illness and of apathy from management.\" State Rep. Josh McLaurin, a Sandy Springs Democrat, has been vocal about problems in Georgia prisons and said he\\'s been frustrated by a lack of information and cooperation from the Department of Corrections. He welcomed the federal investigation, but said it can take a long time for such actions to bear fruit. \"Im very pleased about the trajectory but I want to stress that there are still crisis conditions in prisons that Georgia officials should be addressing immediately with any tool at their disposal,\" he said in a phone interview after the announcement. To that end, he appeared before a meeting of the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles Tuesday morning just before the federal investigation was announced and said the state prison system is melting down, with the coronavirus pandemic contributing to a staff shortage that allows more deaths and violence. He said the board needs to be in an \"emergency mode\" that allows it to release more people in response to conditions. ------ Associated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.\\nAllies of former President Donald Trump are calling those charged in the Jan_ 6 riot at the U_S_ Capitol \"political prisoners.\" WASHINGTON -- First, some blamed the deadly Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol on left-wing antifa antagonists, a theory quickly debunked. Then came comparisons of the rioters to peaceful protesters or even tourists. Now, allies of former President Donald Trump are calling those charged in the Capitol riot \"political prisoners,\" a stunning effort to revise the narrative of that deadly day. The brazen rhetoric ahead of a rally planned for Saturday at the Capitol is the latest attempt to explain away the horrific assault and obscure what played out for all the world to see: rioters loyal to the then-president storming the building, battling police and trying to stop Congress from certifying the election of Democrat Joe Biden. \"Some people are calling it Jan. 6 trutherism -- theyre rewriting the narrative to make it seem like Jan. 6 was no big deal, and it was a damn big deal, and an attack on our democracy,\" said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, who studies extremist movements. All told, the attempted whitewashing of the Jan. 6 attack threatens to further divide an already polarized nation that finds itself drifting from what had been common facts and a shared commitment to civic order toward an unsettling new normal. Rather than a nation healing eight months after the deadly assault, the country is at risk of tearing itself further apart, as the next election approaches. The anticipated crowd size and the intensity of the Saturday rally are unclear, but law enforcement appears to be taking no chances. Security fencing was approved Monday for areas around the Capitol, and reinforcements are being summoned to back up the Capitol Police, whose leadership was criticized and summarily dismissed for its handling of Jan. 6. While authorities have been bracing for a repeat appearance by right-wing extremist groups and other Trump loyalists who mobbed the Capitol, its unclear if those actors will participate in the new event. The extremist groups are concerning because, while members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers made up a small portion of the Jan. 6 rioters, they are accused of some of the more serious crimes in the attack. Whether those groups participate or not, the rally could bring lone actors to Washington. Just after midnight on Monday, Capitol Police arrested a California man who had a bayonet and machete in his pickup truck outside of Democratic National Committee headquarters. The man, Donald Craighead of Oceanside, California, had a swastika and other white supremacist symbols painted on his truck and told officers he was \"on patrol.\" The police said it was unclear if he was planning on attending any upcoming demonstrations. Rally organizer Matt Braynard, a former Trump campaign strategist, has been promoting the event and others like it in cities nationwide, focusing attention on what he calls the \"prisoners\" being unfairly prosecuted for their involvement in the Jan. 6 riot. \"I am so proud of all of the brave patriots who participated in these rallies under the same threat to their rights of so many who are being held in prison now for a non-violent expression of their First Amendment rights,\" he said in a July news release. Braynard declined to respond to additional questions by email, and The Associated Press declined to accept the conditions he made for an interview. As Trump openly considers another run for the White House, many of the Republican lawmakers who joined his effort to challenge Bidens victory are staying away from the Saturday rally, even though many still echo his false claims that the election was rigged -- despite numerous court cases by Trumps allies that have failed to confirm those allegations. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., who joined rally-goers near the White House on Jan. 6 where Trump encouraged the crowd to go to the Capitol, declined to comment, his spokesman said by email. Brooks is now running for the Senate. Another Republican, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who voted to challenge some Electoral College tallies, was unavailable for an interview, his office said. Also declining an interview was Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who was captured in a photo raising a fist in salute to the mob as he entered the Capitol that day. More than 600 people are facing federal charges in the riot that injured dozens of officers and sent lawmakers into hiding. Five people eventually died, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by police as she tried to break into a lobby off the House chamber. Several police officers later took their own lives. Hundreds of people were charged with misdemeanors for entering the Capitol illegally, but hundreds of others are facing more serious felony charges including assault, obstruction of an official proceeding or conspiracy. The most serious cases have been brought against members of two far-right extremist groups -- the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers -- as authorities probe to what extent the attack was planned. No Jan. 6 defendant has been charged with sedition, though it was initially considered by authorities. More than 60 people have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanor charges of demonstrating in the Capitol. Only a fraction of the defendants remain locked up while they await trial. Lawyers have complained of overly harsh conditions for the Jan. 6 defendants in the D.C. jail, saying they are being held in what has been dubbed the \"Patriot Unit.\" Defenders of the alleged Capitol attackers claim they are facing harsher prosecutions because of their political views than others, including Black Lives Matter protesters, but a review of court cases by the AP refutes that claim. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the select panel investigating the Jan. 6 attack, said those who broke the law need to be prosecuted, \"otherwise, we just rationalize, excuse and encourage more of the same.\" The Capitols leafy grounds, a favorite spot for people to snap photos in front of the iconic dome, would typically see few lawmakers or staff on a Saturday. While the Senate returned to session Monday, the House doesn\\'t resume until next week. When the fence first went up around the Capitol after the January attack, it drew heavy criticism from those worried about the message being sent as a symbol of democracy was closed off. Now, it\\'s increasingly seen as a necessary precaution. ------ Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin in Boston and Michael Balsamo, Eric Tucker and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington contributed to this report.\\nTwo congressmen look for common ground at the Minnesota State Fair. More than 1 million people attended the Minnesota State Fair this year -- snacking on pork chops, sizing up the famed butter sculptures and posing with prize-winning farm animals. But Reps. Dean Phillips of Minnesota and Dusty Johnson of South Dakota were looking for something else: an opportunity to find common ground and prove that civility in the country\\'s politics is not extinct. At a time when partisanship is uglier than ever in the halls of Congress, Phillips, a blue state Democrat, and Johnson, a Trump country Republican, are piloting a novel bipartisan political exchange program, featuring joint visits to each other\\'s districts and intimate joint town hall meetings with a diverse mix of constituents. \"There are lots of good people in Congress,\" Johnson told ABC at the Minnesota State Fair where both men poured fresh milk together, visited a barn filled with pregnant livestock and rode down a giant slide. \"You cant work with people you dont trust, and you cant trust people you dont know,\" Phillips said. Both lawmakers are members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of moderate consensus-seekers on Capitol Hill who have notched success brokering compromises around COVID-19 relief and in shaping debate around a bipartisan infrastructure agreement. Despite their sharp differences on government spending, health care and abortion, Phillips and Johnson said they hope actively modeling civility and decency will lay the groundwork for a more productive legislative process in Washington. \"The people who are loudest really want us to be divided. I think most members are good people who want to find common ground but, man alive, the loudest ones -- they get a disproportionate amount of the attention,\" Johnson said. In a Minneapolis suburb, Phillips and Johnson convened with seven voters from across the political spectrum -- liberals and conservatives, all strangers to each other -- for a conversation moderated by the nonpartisan nonprofit Braver Angels, founded by University of Minnesota professor and licensed marriage therapist Bill Doherty. The organization, established after the 2016 election, is dedicated to breaking through polarized political rhetoric and building bipartisan trust at a grassroots level. It has facilitated more than 1,000 conversations across the country. \"Ive been doing marriage therapy for 40 years, Ive never seen politics invade the marriage like it has now,\" Doherty told ABC News. \"We seem to have more things that are dividing us than ever.\" Johnson and Phillips became the first members of Congress to take part in a conversation moderated by Braver Angels, where they sat among participants and joined the frank dialogue about how political polarization has strained family relationships, divided neighborhoods and unsettled communities nationwide. Nick Erpelding, a self-identified conservative, said politics was \"nowhere near the top of the conversation list\" when he married his left-of-center wife 14 years ago. \"You cant go anywhere today without people looking at you, and before they even know who you are, they want to know, OK, is this person vaccinated, or is this person toting a gun?\" he said. Michael, a self-identified liberal participant, said some relationships in his family are so strained that his son doesnt see his cousins. \"Its tragic,\" he said. \"Some people that I talk to wonder could we go to civil war if we dont stop this and find a better way?\" Led by Doherty -- who cut off the participants and lawmakers from interrupting one another -- the conversation did not even mention former President Donald Trump or President Joe Biden by name. Instead, using prompts such as \"health care\" and \"polarization,\" participants listened to personal stories and perspectives instead of debating or challenging one another. That included Johnson and Phillips, who spoke about their families and frustrations with colleagues on Capitol Hill who are more interested in celebrity than compromise. \"If you pose questions about what really is concerning people in their lives and in their communities, they don\\'t go right away to the politicians,\" Doherty explained about the groups approach. Together, the group didnt find a way to make health care more affordable or bring Republicans and Democrats together around fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. But they left the conversation with a greater appreciation of the others in the group and their perspectives. \"Were more alike than we are different,\" said Erin Brumm, another conservative participant. \"It was a little bit surprising, but enlightening.\" \"I learn from him. He learns from me,\" Phillips said of Johnson and their experience in Minnesota. \"And if that can be just a tiny bit of a seed that we metaphorically plant at the state fair ... thats a darn good beginning.\" Phillips said he plans to visit Johnson\\'s district soon, and both said they have convened their congressional offices for similar workshops. The Minnesota trip was organized in part by the Bipartisan Policy Center, which said it has 30 more exchange visits planned for this fall and winter. Both lawmakers will also be able to put their new approach to the test later this month when Congress debates infrastructure legislation and Biden\\'s domestic policy agenda -- in addition to must-past business that includes government funding and the nation\\'s debt limit.\\nThe Biden administration is stepping up its effort to find and unite migrant families forcibly separated under President Donald Trump WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is expanding its effort to find and reunite migrant families who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border under President Donald Trump as part of a zero-tolerance policy on illegal crossings. A federal task force is launching a new program Monday that officials say will expand efforts to find parents, many of whom are in remote Central American communities, and help them return to the United States, where they will get at least three years of legal residency and other assistance. \"We recognize that we cant make these families completely whole again,\" said Michelle Brane, executive director of the administration\\'s Family Reunification Task Force. \"But we want to do everything we can to put them on a path towards a better life.\" The new program, which includes a contract with the International Organization for Migration to help with the often-complex task of getting expelled migrants back to the U.S., is a reflection of just how difficult it has been for President Joe Biden\\'s administration to address a chapter in U.S. immigration history that drew widespread condemnation. The task force has reunited about 50 families since starting its work in late February, but there are hundreds of parents, and perhaps between 1,000 and 2,000, who were separated from their children and have not been located. A lack of accurate records from the Trump administration makes it difficult to say for certain, Brane said. \"It is it a huge challenge that we are absolutely committed to following through to meet and to do whatever we can to reunify these families,\" she said as she outlined the new program in an interview with The Associated Press. The Trump administration separated thousands of migrant parents from their children in 2017 and 2018 as it moved to criminally prosecute people for illegally crossing the southwest border. Minors, who could not be held in criminal custody with their parents, were transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. They were then typically sent to live with a sponsor, often a relative or someone else with a connection to the family. Amid public outrage, Trump issued an executive order halting the practice of family separations in June 2018, days before a federal judge did the same and demanded that separated families be reunited in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. More than 5,500 children were separated from their families, according to the ACLU. The task force came up with an initial estimate closer to 4,000 but has been examining hundreds of other cases. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas held a virtual call with reunited families last month. \"He made it very clear that an apology is not enough, that we really need to do a lot more for them and we recognize that,\" Brane said. The new program includes a web portal that will allow parents to contact the U.S. government to begin the process of reunification. The site and an outreach campaign to promote it will be in English, Spanish, Portuguese and several indigenous languages of Central America. Most of the parents are believed to be in Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Brazil. They often lack passports and the means to travel to their own country\\'s capital, let alone return to the U.S. to try to gain entry at the border. Once parents who were separated from their children are located, the U.S. will work with the International Organization for Migration to help people get passports and other documents and return to the United States, where they will get work permits, residency for three years and some support services. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLUs immigrant rights project, welcomed the Biden administrations expanded efforts as \"an important first step,\" though he believes migrants should get more than three years of residency. \"Ultimately, we need the families to be given permanent legal status in light of what the United States government deliberately did to these families,\" Gelernt said. The ACLU is in talks with the government to provide some compensation to the families as part of settlement talks. Brane said the administration recognizes that \"we need to find a better, longer-term solution to provide families with stability,\" but that it will take more time, and perhaps action from Congress, to achieve that goal. The contract with the IOM, an inter-governmental organization, and the expanded effort to find migrant parents and help them reach the U.S. are initially planned to run for a year but could be extended if necessary. \"Well continue looking for people until we feel that weve exhausted the options,\" she said. This effort comes amid an increase over the past year in the number of migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, especially children traveling alone, in part due to crime and poverty in Central America. As part of what the Biden administration has portrayed as an effort to address the \"root causes\" of illegal crossings, it announced separately Monday that the government would start taking applications for an expanded program that enables children in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to join parents and legal guardians who are citizens or have legal residency in the U.S. That program was halted under Trump.\\nThe Zapad exercises are likely Russia\\'s largest in Europe since the Cold War. MULINO FIRING RANGE, Russia -- Russian President Vladimir Putin watched a huge display of firepower put on by his military Monday when he attended the finale of what is believed to be the largest Russian war games held in Europe since the Cold War. The joint exercises with Belarus -- called Zapad -- take place every four years and their main phase began last week, involving tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks, aircrafts and warships at sites across western Russia and in Belarus. Zapad -- which means \"West\" in Russian -- is intended to test the country\\'s ability to fight a major war with NATO on its western border. The exercise has its origins in the Cold War, but in recent years as relations have worsened with the West, Putin has increased their scale, using them to illustrate restored Russian power. Russia has claimed this year\\'s exercises involve 200,000 troops, but most military analysts believe that is a significant exaggeration, and the real figure is likely something closer to 50,000 to 100,000. Putin on Monday attended what amounted to a heavily scripted, grand finale to the drills which took place at a firing range near Nizhny Novgorod, a city about 300 miles from Moscow. From a grandstand overlooking the Mulino range, Putin watched the event through a pair of binoculars, while heavily armed snipers kept guard. For 45 minutes, Russian troops unleashed a colossal barrage, involving howitzers, multiple rocket launchers and dozens of tanks and armored vehicles, while warplanes and helicopters flew in waves overhead. In the exercise, the Russian-led force was defending against a military belonging to a notional enemy, named \"the westerners.\" Besides Russian and Belarusian troops, small contingents from India, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Armenia also participated. The display watched by Putin appeared notably larger than that put on in 2017, at the last Zapad exercises -- and those drills rattled nerves in eastern Europe, amid overheated speculation that they might be used to cover an imminent Russian invasion. This year\\'s exercises attracted much less media attention, despite a more tense political atmosphere in Belarus following the mass protests against authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko\\'s crushing of the peaceful protests, with Russia\\'s support, has placed him and Moscow in confrontation with European countries and the United States. Since Lukashenko sought rescue from the Kremlin, there have been concerns that Putin will use that leverage to demand he fulfill a long-time Russian goal of integrating Belarus with Russia. Last week, as the exercises began, Putin and Lukashenko announced plans for significantly deeper economic integration, under the slogan \"Two countries, one economy.\" With Lukashenko now dependent on Russian support to remain in power, both sides are using the drills to emphasize Moscow\\'s strong backing of the Belarusian leader. \"It is in Minsk\\'s interest to invite a much larger Russian footprint as a show of support for the regime,\" Michael Kofman, director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses, wrote in an article for the website War on the Rocks last week. \"Judging from early deployments and training range selection, a more sizable Russian contingent will be in Belarus and Russian troops will be much closer to the borders with Poland than they were during previous Zapad exercises,\" said Kofman. The exercise\\'s imagined scenario simulated Russia helping Belarus to defend against an attack by three fictional states, \"Nyaris,\" \"Pomoria\" and the \"Polar Republic\" -- thinly disguised versions of Lithuania, Poland and a Scandinavian country. Lukashenko has claimed the protests against him are part of a planned invasion of Belarus by NATO countries, repeatedly making wild claims last year that western forces were massed on the border. This year\\'s Zapad drills appeared partly to incorporate that scenario, including scripts where western-backed \"terrorists\" provoked instability, as a pretext for invasion. Belarus\\' neighbors Poland and Lithuania have expressed unease about the exercises again this year. Both countries are already struggling with a migration crisis engineered by Lukashenko in relation to their support for pro-democracy opposition. In recent months, European officials have accused Lukashenko of flying in thousands of migrants, mostly from Iraq, and pushing them across the border. The exercises, though important for training, are also in many ways also a campaign tool for Putin. Stephen Ganyard, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and ABC News contributor said the shows of force are \"mostly for domestic consumption.\" The dramatic show on Monday came just four days before Russia\\'s parliamentary elections. Military experts have cautioned against accepting Russia\\'s claims about the size of the exercises, which they warn are partly intended to give an exaggerated impression of Russian military power. \"Russian military leaders likely hope Western media will report exaggerated figures, which help validate the scale and success of the exercise,\" Kofman wrote. NATO has also accused Russia of failing to formally declare the real number of troops involved. A 1990 agreement, the Vienna Document, obliges Russia to invite observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for exercises involving more than 13,000 troops. But despite its public statements that 200,000 are taking part, Russia has circumvented the rule by claiming fewer than 13,000 troops are participating in each individual drill. Russia has insisted the exercises are entirely defensive and at firing ranges last week Russian commanders were careful to repeat the drills were not intended to be threatening. \"We didn\\'t want to worry anyone,\" said Col. Alexander Zavasky, the commander of an airborne unit drilling in Kaliningrad, told ABC News on Saturday. \"It\\'s a pre-planned exercise, and so, don\\'t worry.\"\\nThe first trial in the college admissions bribery scandal is underway with defense attorneys seeking to portray the two parents accused of buying their kids way into school as victims of con man who believed their payments were legitimate donations BOSTON -- The first trial in the college admissions bribery scandal opened Monday with defense attorneys seeking to portray the two parents accused of buying their kids\\' way into school as victims of a con man who believed their payments were legitimate donations. Defense attorneys said former casino executive Gamal Abdelaziz and former Staples and Gap Inc. executive John Wilson never discussed paying bribes. They were assured by the admissions consultant at the center of the scheme that what they were doing was a perfectly legal practice to give children of parents with deep pockets a leg up in admissions, the defense said. \"It\\'s not illegal to give money to schools with the hope that it helps your kid get in,\" Abdelaziz\\'s attorney, Brian Kelly, told jurors in his opening statement. \"No one ever said bribery to him.\" The first trial in the so-called \"Operation Varsity Blues\" case is getting underway in Boston\\'s federal court more than two years after prosecutors arrested 50 parents, athletic coaches and others in the scheme that embroiled elite universities across the country. Thirty three other parents have pleaded guilty, including TV actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin and Loughlins fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli. The parents have so far received punishments ranging from probation to nine months in prison. Abdelaziz, of Las Vegas, is accused of paying $300,000 to the sham charity run by the scheme\\'s mastermind -- admissions consultant Rick Singer -- to get his daughter into the University of Southern California as a basketball recruit even though she didn\\'t even make it onto her high school\\'s varsity team. Wilson, who heads a Massachusetts private equity firm, is charged with paying $220,000 to have his son designated as a USC water polo recruit and an additional $1 million to buy his twin daughters ways into Harvard and Stanford. Prosecutors say the parents were well aware their payments were designed to get their kids into school as athletic recruits with fake or embellished credentials as part of Singer\\'s so-called, side-door scheme. \"That is what this case is about: lies,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Leslie Wright said. Its \"not about wealthy people donating money to universities with the hope that their children get preferential treatment in the admissions process.\" Prosecutors will show jurors emails and phone calls between Singer and the parents that the admissions consultant recorded after he began cooperating with investigators in 2018. In one phone call, Singer told Abdelaziz that a USC official told him Abdelaziz\\'s daughter\\'s fake athletic profile was so well done that she wanted him to use that profile going forward for \"anybody who isn\\'t a real basketball player that\\'s a female,\" according to court documents. \"I love it,\" Abdelaziz responded. Singer, who has pleaded guilty but hasn\\'t been sentenced yet, was long expected to be the government\\'s star witness. But prosecutors have said they wont call the admissions consultant to the stand. Defense attorneys suggested they will seize on that decision to try to sow doubt in the government\\'s case. \"The case revolves around Rick Singer, the whole investigation, it\\'s why were here. And now in opening statements, the government says \\'never mind, were not calling him. Think about that when you eventually deliberate,\" Kelly told jurors. Defense attorneys described Singer as a skilled con man who mixed truth with lies and manipulated the parents to line his own pockets. Wilson\\'s attorney, Michael Kendall, said Wilson\\'s son actually was a star water polo player and that Singer told Wilson a donation could give a boost to students like his son who were qualified to get in. \"Before and after he started working for the government, Mr. Singer repeatedly told John that the side door was perfectly legitimate and exactly what the schools wanted,\" Kendall said. The first witness for the government is Bruce Isackson who -- along with his wife Davina -- pleaded guilty in 2019 to paying $600,000 to get his daughters into USC and the University of California, Los Angeles. The Isacksons agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in the hopes of getting a lighter sentence. Bruce Isackson told jurors that Singer claimed to have done the side-door scheme \"countless times\" and that it was \"basically bulletproof.\" That promise was important to him and his wife when considering whether to join in on the scheme because he said they \"didn\\'t want to be guinea pigs\" and \"have this blow up\" and his daughter exposed. The trial is expected to last a few weeks. All told, nearly four dozen people have admitted to charges in the case. They include coaches at such schools as Yale, Stanford and UCLA. Former senior associate athletic director at USC, Donna Heinel, and three coaches are scheduled to stand trial in November. Three other parents are expected to face jurors in January.\\nSo far, some major U.S. airlines have only mandated employee vaccinations. The nation\\'s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said he would support mandating the COVID-19 vaccine for air travel. \"I would support that,\" Dr. Fauci told The Skimm podcast on Friday. \"If you want to get on a plane and travel with other people ... you should be vaccinated.\" He did not specify in the podcast interview whether the vaccine mandate he supports would just be for travelers over the age of 12 or all travelers. The U.S. Travel Association responded that while they support people getting vaccinated, they have \"long maintained that there should be no mandatory vaccination requirement for domestic travel.\" \"Such a policy would have an unfair, negative impact on families with young children who are not yet eligible to get the vaccine,\" the statement continued. They believe the mask mandate, which has been extended through January 2022, is enough to keep passengers safe -- pointing to a study conducted by the Department of Defense in partnership with United Airlines. The study found that the risk of COVID-19 exposure onboard an aircraft is \"virtually non-existent\" and when masks are worn there is only a 0.003% chance particles from a passenger can enter the breathing space of a passenger sitting beside them. \"Proper tools are already in place to enable safe air travel for Americans,\" the association emphasized. White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff Zients was also asked about the possibility of vaccine mandates for domestic flights Monday. \"We\\'re pulling available levers to require vaccinations and we\\'re not taking any measures off the table,\" he said. Last week, the Biden administration proposed employers with more than 100 workers mandate the COVID-19 vaccine or offer weekly testing. Some major U.S. airlines, like United, have already announced they will require all employees to be fully vaccinated and grant little room for exceptions. But U.S. airline CEOs have been skeptical about the feasibility of mandating vaccines for passengers. United CEO Scott Kirby has called the suggestion \"logistically impractical.\" \"I think it would require government response and government tracking to make that practical and make it work,\" he told MSNBC last month, \"and so it\\'s probably unlikely to happen domestically.\" Delta CEO Ed Bastian told CBS it would be a \"logistical dilemma\" to try and implement the requirement in the U.S. and threaten to \"bottleneck the domestic travel system.\"\\nThis report is a part of \"America Strong,\" an ABC News series highlighting stories of strength and resiliency across the nation. Every weekend, Shirley Raines gets up early to head to Skid Row, a neighborhood in Downtown Los Angeles known for its struggles with homelessness and poverty. At Skid Row, Raines wears many different hats: she\\'s a makeup artist, a hair technician, a provider and a mother figure. She gives makeovers, dyes hair, hands out food and sends her clients off with a warm, \"I love you.\" Beauty 2 The Streetz, a group started by Raines herself, has served hundreds, if not thousands, of homeless people in the region for six years. She and her team provide those in need with hot showers, hygiene products and other necessities to make life easier for those living on the streets. Raines has begun documenting her work, and the stories of the people she serves, on social media, earning millions of views and likes on TikTok. In the comments section, she fends off stigma against homeless and impoverished communities. But she hopes her videos remind viewers that her clients are just as deserving of love, happiness and a good life. \"I would like for people to understand and know that at any given time, this could be you,\" Raines said, referring to those living with homelessness. \"How come we taught society that these people are to be blamed for their circumstances?\" How Beauty 2 The Streetz began In 1987, Raines lost her son Demetrius just days before his third birthday. She spent years mourning, looking for answers to her loss and pain. Six years ago, in an effort to make sense of her grief, she stumbled upon a friend at church who was off to feed the homeless and invited her along. That was the start of Raines\\'s path to Beauty 2 The Streetz. \"I think it just hit me -- that I\\'ve got to do something with this pain,\" Raines said. \"I never expected this work to be so healing for me.\" She continued her work at Skid Row with a local charity organization at first, and soon enough, she was known as the \"makeup lady.\" Raines always rolled up with a full face of makeup and a head of colorful hair when she volunteered. It quickly grabbed the attention of her clients. She began to provide hair and makeup services herself, fully funded with her own money. And though the makeup and hair skills of her and her team help others look and feel great, she says it\\'s the connections and friendships that keep her clients coming back. \"I really, really in my heart do not think it\\'s the hair color or the makeup, I think it\\'s the time that someone spends with them,\" Raines said. \"It\\'s the time that someone spends touching them, it\\'s the time someone spends catering to them. ... A lot of people don\\'t even look in the mirror, girl!\" There\\'s a brightness in their eyes when they walk away from the salon chair. That joy is healing for Raines, but she also knows that\\'s not enough. Though she offers help and assistance in the ways that she can, she is adamant that local officials do the work to address systemic issues of poverty, addiction and violence that plague the neighborhood. Improving Skid Row Skid Row has one of the largest stable homeless populations in the United States, with roughly 3,000 homeless people out on the streets, according to the Community Redevelopment Agency of the city of Los Angeles. It\\'s a heavily condensed area; the Community Redevelopment Agency reports that the neighborhood contains roughly 3% of the countys homeless population, yet it makes up only 0.0001% of the countys total land area. \"It\\'s one of the most dangerous areas in Los Angeles,\" Raines said. \"It\\'s considered toxic, it\\'s considered an area that\\'s filled with dangerous people and people who have been dismissed by life.\" But she denounces that understanding of the Skid Row community, a fact evident in her TikTok videos, which she hopes can crush the stereotypes and preconceived notions of homeless people that her viewers have. Kirkpatrick Tyler, director of Skid Row Strategy at the Mayor\\'s Office of Public Engagement, said that the work to improve Skid Row and the conditions of life there is ongoing. Tyler said initiatives on mental health care, substance abuse rehabilitation, violence and affordable housing are in progress, building on years of attempts to address these issues. He said community members are helping lead the discussions on how to move the city forward. \"Skid Row is full of vibrant people with big hearts that believe in themselves, that believe in one another, and that are committed and dedicated to transforming that community,\" Tyler said. \"For our office, that was actually one of the first things that we had to address -- that we were no longer going to speak about Skid Row as an area in downtown that had a homeless problem, that we would speak about Skid Row as a community,\" he added. He said efforts like Raines\\' help give people that human connection that makes the neighborhood the community that it is. Turning strangers into friends Every time she hands out food or works on someone\\'s hair, Raines tells her clients that she loves them. She never expected them to say it back, but since her son\\'s death, she knew how important and impactful those words can be. \"I love you\" were some of the last words she told her son before he died. Now, those words are said back to her every time she heads to Skid Row. \"It\\'s so funny when I watch back videos, there are random strangers coming to my window like, \\'OK, love you, see you next week.\\' I\\'m like, \\'Oh, OK, love you too,\\'\" Raines said, laughing. \"It just feels good, because I know how hard it is to trust when life hasn\\'t been kind to you, people haven\\'t been kind to you.\" And though nothing can heal the wound of a lost child, Raines said she finds solace and recovery in her work. She reminds her viewers to have compassion for people experiencing homelessness -- and to give back to those in need as much as possible. She thanks the many donors on social media who have already helped her fund the initiative. \"We think that they\\'re a burden to society but they\\'re not a burden to society. Society is a burden to them,\" Raines said. \"The goal in life is not to have as much as you can; the goal in life is to give as much as you can.\"\\nThe house that former drug kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman fled in 2014 when Mexican marines had him surrounded has undergone some changes CULIACAN, Mexico -- The house former drug kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman fled in 2014 when Mexican marines had him surrounded underwent some changes recently as the Mexican government prepared to give it away in a national lottery. The surveillance cameras that covered every angle of the modest homes exterior were removed. And the hole under a bathtub that Guzman had slipped through to reach a network of tunnels was covered with a concrete slab. The Associated Press was given access to the property in a quiet Culiacan neighborhood ahead of the lottery. In recent weeks, Mexicos Institute to Return Stolen Goods to the People, known by its initials as INDEP, gave it a fresh coat of white paint inside and out and tiled over the spot in the bathroom where the tub and tunnel entry point had been. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been talking up the lottery of seized properties, but gave no mention to the history of this particular house. An expansive home in one of Mexico Citys swankiest neighborhoods and a private box at the famed Azteca Stadium have garnered more attention. INDEPs website lists it only as \"Casa en Culiacan.\" Its about 2,800 square feet and located, perhaps appropriately, in a neighborhood called Libertad, or \"Freedom.\" The government values the two-bedroom home at $183,000. The house had been abandoned for years and the marines did some damage when they searched it, so repairs were necessary. Guzman escaped that time through the tunnels, but his freedom lasted only days. On Feb. 22, 2014, the marines descended again, this time in a condo on the coast in Mazatlan. By that time, Guzman already had a reputation for daring escapes. He had slipped out of one of Mexicos maximum-security prisons in 2001, allegedly in a laundry cart. In July 2015, less than a year and half after his capture in Mazatlan, Guzman slipped through a tunnel dug up to the drain in his cells shower and rode a motorcycle on tracks laid through a tunnel to escape another maxium-security Mexican prison. The marines captured him again six months later in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, where he had been holed up in another unremarkable home. Guzman was extradited to the United States, tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison in July 2019. INDEP officials, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak, said they were surprised the house was getting attention. It is not luxurious. There is no swimming pool, none of the ostentation that characterizes other narco properties in Sinaloa. People nearby said they didn\\'t know who their neighbor was. \"We never knew anything, we never knew who lived there, we never saw anyone,\" said one neighbor, who quickly cut off the conversation. Many locals aren\\'t interested in speaking of Guzman or even saying his name in a place where the Sinaloa cartel remains powerful. The house was well located for its previous purposes. There is a neighbor only on one side. On the other is a subterranean storm sewer -- Culiacan built hundreds of kilometers of them to deal with torrential rains -- which is where the bathroom tunnel connected to make Guzmans escape possible. A school is across the street. On the morning of Feb. 17, 2014, the neighborhood was suddenly filled with the marines grey trucks. They blocked traffic. There was no doubt they were interested in the seemingly unremarkable house. But they didnt find Guzman there. In fact, during his U.S. trial, a witness testified that Guzman was not in any of the five houses marines searched, despite reports to the contrary at the time. Five days later, the marines caught up to Guzman 125 miles to the south in Mazatlan, where he was staying with his wife Emma Coronel and their twin daughters. INDEP tried to auction off the home last year. It started the bidding at about $130,000. There were no takers. Now, Lopez Obrador is giving it away as part of the lottery, with the drawing scheduled for Wednesday, the day before Mexico celebrates its Independence Day. Its the first time Mexicos national lottery is giving away property. The proceeds are to go to Mexicos Olympic athletes. \"This raffle is very important and I call on all the people, those who can help buying a ticket, or two or three,\" Lopez Obrador said at his daily news conference last week. In downtown Mexico City, lottery ticket vendors said sales have been good. Jorge Lopez said hes been selling 100 to 120 of the $12 tickets daily since last week. \"Right now, its selling very well.\" He said the value of the 22 prizes, many well above that of the Culiacan house, is drawing attention. Some people ask about who the properties previous owners were, but not many, he said. Back in Culiacan, across town near the center, Ignacio Mariscal said he supports the lottery. \"Those houses didnt serve anyone; those people had them,\" Mariscal said. \"I see it as perfectly fine. Its to help people in need.\" ---- AP writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.\\nIn a blitz of TV ads and a last-minute rally, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom urged voters to defeat a looming recall that could remove him from office LOS ANGELES -- In a blitz of TV ads and a last-minute rally, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom urged voters Sunday to turn back a looming recall vote that could remove him from office, while leading Republican Larry Elder broadly criticized the media for what he described as double standards that insulated Newsom from criticism and scrutiny throughout the contest. The sunny, late-summer weekend was a swirl of political activity, as candidates held rallies, continued bus tours and cluttered the TV airwaves with advertising offering their closing arguments in advance of the election that concludes Tuesday. Newsom -- who is expecting President Joe Biden on Monday for a capstone get-out-the-vote rally in Long Beach -- was in a largely Hispanic area on the northern edge of Los Angeles, where he sought to drive up turnout with the key voting bloc. Elder also was in Los Angeles, where he was joined by activist and former actress Rose McGowan, who repeated her claims from recent days that Newsoms wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, attempted to persuade her in 2017 not to go public with her allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Siebel Newsoms office described the allegations as a \"complete fabrication.\" In a brief interview with The Associated Press, Newsom characterized McGowans claims as a \"last-minute classic hit piece\" from one of Elders supporters. The governor called Elder desperate and grasping, saying McGowans claims about his wife \"just shows you how low things go in campaigns these days.\" He echoed his earlier criticism of Elder, saying the conservative talk show host and lawyer \"doesnt believe that women have the right to their own reproductive freedoms, hes devoutly opposed to Roe v. Wade, doesnt believe theres a glass ceiling, doesnt believe in pay equity laws.\" During her appearance, McGowan spoke warmly of Elder and lambasted Hollywood Democrats who she said traumatized her life. She now lives in Mexico. \"Do I agree with him on all points? No,\" McGowan said. \"So what. He is the better candidate. He is the better man.\" The last-minute exchange highlighted growing tensions in the election, which largely grew out frustration with Newsoms pandemic orders that shuttered schools and businesses during the pandemic. Voting concludes Tuesday. Recent polling shows Newsom is likely to hold his job. As Newsoms \"first partner,\" Siebel Newsom, an actress turned documentary filmmaker, has championed gender equality and societys treatment of women and families. McGowan, 48, who is known for her role in the \"Scream\" movie franchise, was one of the earliest of dozens of women to accuse Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, making her a major figure in the #MeToo movement. Elder, who could become the state\\'s first Black governor, targeted some of his sharpest remarks at what he described as skewed media coverage. Earlier this week, his walking tour of homeless encampments in LAs Venice Beach neighborhood was cut short after a woman bicyclist wearing a gorilla mask threw an egg toward Elder and then took a swing at a member of his entourage. The confrontation set off strong reactions on Twitter, with conservatives charging the incident wasnt immediately branded a racist attack because Elder is a conservative. If he was a Democrat \"it would have been a major story,\" Elder said. He also said McGowans accusations largely have been ignored by the media, but argued that if similar charges had been made about him \"thats all you guys would be talking about.\" \"This is a double standard,\" he said. \"Im sick of it.\" Emails posted on Twitter by McGowan showed she had contact with Newsoms wife, which her office confirmed but said their communication was \"as fellow survivors of sexual assault and in Jennifers former capacity leading the Representation Project, an organization that fights limiting gender stereotypes and norms.\" One of McGowans key claims is that during a 2017 phone conversation, Newsoms wife referenced a law firm that was working with Weinstein and asked her what the firm could do \"to make you happy.\" McGowan said Sunday she didnt recognize the firms name at the time. \"I had no idea who that was. So, I just said nothing and hung up on her. That was my last contact with her,\" she said. The election will determine whether Newsom can complete his first term or will be tossed out of office more than a year early. Voters are being asked two questions: Should Newsom be recalled and, if so, who should replace him? If he gets a majority vote on the first question, the second question with the names of 46 replacement candidate is irrelevant. Otherwise, the highest vote-getter among the replacement candidates would become governor.\\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken has pushed back against harsh Republican criticism of the Biden administration\\'s handling of the military withdrawal from Afghanistan WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Antony Blinken pushed back Monday against harsh Republican criticism of the handling of the military withdrawal from Afghanistan, saying the Biden administration inherited a deal with the Taliban to end the war, but no plan for carrying it out. In a sometimes contentious hearing Monday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Blinken sought to blunt complaints from angry GOP lawmakers about the administrations response to the quick collapse of the Afghan government and, more specifically, the State Departments actions to evacuate Americans and others. Blinken echoed White House talking points blaming the Trump administration for the situation that President Joe Biden inherited in Afghanistan. \"We inherited a deadline. We did not inherit a plan,\" he said, maintaining that the administration had done the right thing in ending 20 years of war. \"We made the right decision in ending Americas longest-running war,\" said Blinken, who will testify on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Republicans savaged the withdrawal process as \"a disaster\" and \"a disgrace.\" And while some Democrats allowed that the operation could have been handled better, many used their questions to heap criticism on former President Donald Trump. The State Department has come under heavy criticism from both sides for not doing enough and not acting quickly enough to get American citizens, legal residents and at-risk Afghans out of the country after the Taliban took control of Kabul on Aug. 15. Some seeking to leave remain stranded there, although Blinken could not provide an exact number. He said roughly 100 U.S. citizens remain along with about \"several thousand\" green card holders. \"This was an unmitigated disaster of epic proportions,\" said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the committee. He said the abrupt withdrawal along with leaving some Americans and Afghans behind had \"emboldened the Taliban\" and other U.S. adversaries. \"I can summarize this in one word: betrayal.\" His GOP colleagues Steve Chabot of Ohio and Lee Zeldin of New York were even more blunt. \"This is a disgrace,\" Chabot said. \"This was fatally flawed and poorly executed,\" said Zeldin. \"I believe that you, sir, should resign. That would be leadership.\" The chairman of the committee, New York Rep. Gregory Meeks, urged his colleagues to keep politics out of their criticism. But he acknowledged that there had been problems. \"Could things have been done differently? Absolutely,\" he said. Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who has been ostracized by many in the GOP for his criticism of Trump, placed blame for the situation on both Trump and Biden. \"The Trump administration failed in the setup and the Biden administration failed in the execution,\" Kinzinger said. Blinken tried to calmly deflect allegations of unpreparedness by noting that the Biden administration had inherited a U.S.-Taliban peace deal from its predecessor, along with a languishing program to grant visas to Afghans who had worked for the U.S. government. Blinken, who had publicly predicted in June that a complete Taliban takeover would not happen \"from a Friday to a Monday,\" also tried to preempt criticism of the prediction by noting that no one in the U.S. government expected the Afghan government to fall as quickly as it did. \"Even the most pessimistic assessments did not predict that government forces in Kabul would collapse while U.S. forces remained,\" Blinken said in prepared remarks released ahead of his appearance. He also defended the evacuation effort, saying it succeeded despite near insurmountable odds. \"The evacuation was an extraordinary effort -- under the most difficult conditions imaginable -- by our diplomats, military, and intelligence professionals,\" he said. \"In the end, we completed one of the biggest airlifts in history, with 124,000 people evacuated to safety.\" But Republicans, in particular, have been demanding answers as to why American citizens were left behind in the chaotic days and weeks before the military completed its withdrawal on Aug. 30. In a preview of GOP questions, the Republican National Committee released a statement earlier Monday with the banner headline \"Fire Blinken,\" demanding that he be held to account for what it described as a litany of failings. After the more than five-hour hearing concluded, the GOP committee doubled down on its demand. \"Todays hearing makes Blinkens failures and lies abundantly clear,\" RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said. \"Biden has no choice but to fire Blinken, hold him accountable, and take responsibility for the disaster he created.\" Some Republicans appeared to have be spoiling for a fight with the generally unflappable Blinken. Rep. Bryan Mast of Florida accused Blinken of lying when he denied that intelligence had been manipulated to support Biden\\'s desire to withdraw U.S. troops. \"I do not believe a word you have said,\" he told Blinken. In a rare show of temper, Blinken replied: \"Simply put, what you said congressman, is dead wrong.\" Blinken is very close to Biden and his job as America\\'s top diplomat is almost certainly safe, but criticism of the administration\\'s handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal has not been limited to Republicans. Numerous Democrats have also questioned the policy and expressed concern about stranded Americans, green card holders and Afghans who could face retaliation from the Taliban because of their work or ties to the U.S. government over the past 20 years. State Department officials have acknowledged that the congressional hearings could be contentious and possibly ugly, but many remain convinced the U.S. military and other officials did the best they could under extremely trying circumstances -- including the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and the crush of thousands of desperate people at Kabul\\'s airport seeking to leave the country.\\nA company that most of the legal U.S. sports betting industry uses to verify that its customers are where they say they are has reported a record number of transactions over the first weekend of the NFL season ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- A company that most of the legal U.S. sports betting industry uses to verify that its customers are where they say they are reported on Monday a record number of transactions over the first weekend of the NFL season. GeoComply Solutions, the Vancouver, Canada-based tech company, said it recorded 58.2 million geolocation transactions across 18 states and Washington, D.C., from Thursday night, when the NFL season began, through 7 p.m. EST Sunday. That represents a 126% increase from the same period of the 2020 NFL season, when GeoComply processed 25.8 million transactions. \"We expected high volumes, but what we have seen has surprised us nonetheless,\" said Lindsay Slader, a managing director with Geocomply. \"The level of demand across new markets, such as Arizona, indicates that consumers have long waited for the option to legally place a sports bet.\" The data records the amount of times the company was called on to verify a customer\\'s location. It is considered a good indicator for at least a minimum level of sports betting activity, more than 80% of which is done online in the U.S. States require a gambler to be physically located within their borders in order to make an online sports bet, which is where geolocation technology comes in. It uses a combination of cellphone data, software, hardware and databases to determine where a phone or laptop trying to make a bet is actually located. While it is true that customers can log in and have their location verified without actually placing a bet, many gamblers also make more than one bet after a single login. In just three years, legal sports betting has spread to more than half the country. New Jersey won a U.S. Supreme Court case in 2018 clearing the way for any state to adopt legal sports betting. When Thursday night\\'s game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Dallas Cowboys kicked off, 26 states plus Washington, D.C., offered legal sports betting, according to the American Gaming Association, the gambling industry\\'s national trade group. But not all of them offer online sports betting. GeoComply says it saw the most activity in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Illinois. Arizona, which launched its sports betting on Thursday, has seen more than 6.1 million geolocation transactions from more than 271,000 newly created accounts since then, the company said Monday. ------ Follow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC\\nSupreme Court Justices Stephen Breyer and Amy Coney Barrett found common ground Monday over shared concern that the nation\\'s highest court is increasingly viewed in ideological terms. Barrett, in one of her first public speeches as a justice, told an audience Sunday in Kentucky that \"this court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks,\" according to the Louisville Courier-Journal. Breyer, asked about those comments in an interview with the Washington Post on Monday, said that he agrees \"with I think the approach is that she\\'s taking there.\" \"As Ive said, it takes some years and then you gradually pick up the mores of the institution. And the mores of the institution -- youre a judge, and you better be there for everybody,\" said Breyer, the court\\'s oldest member and most senior liberal. \"Even if a Democrat or Republican appointed you - youre there as a judge.\" Barrett appeared to echo that sentiment in her speech, telling the audience that differences among \"judicial philosophies are not the same as political parties.\" Her message may have been undercut, however, by the fact that the event was hosted by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell inside an academic center named in his honor. Several progressive legal groups and independent judicial watchdogs criticized the the optics. \"If Justice Barrett wants the Supreme Court not to be seen as partisan, she should avoid being hosted by a center named after the most partisan person in America,\" said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix The Court, a nonpartisan advocacy group. \"Theres value in members of the high court speaking to audiences outside of Washington, but that concept is corrupted when stretched to rationalize appearing at events that look and sound like political pep rallies.\" Breyer was not asked about and did not comment on the connection with McConnell. His appearance came as part of a media tour for his new book, \"The Authority of the Court and the Peril of Politics.\" The public defense of the court as a nonpartisan institution comes at a fraught time for the justices and their credibility. The Court\\'s approval rating has dipped below 50% for the first time since 2017 and down 9-points from a decade high just last year, according to Gallup. This month, the court became embroiled in a dramatic and highly divisive debate over abortion in Texas, after refusing to block an unprecedented law that effectively outlaws the procedure across the state by a narrow 5-4 vote. Barrett voted with the majority; Breyer dissented. \"The timing wasnt very good for my book because its pretty hard to believe when a case like those come along that were less divided than you might think,\" Breyer lamented. \"A lot of people will strongly disagree with many of the opinions or dissents that you write, but still, internally, you must feel that this is not a political institution, that this is an institution that\\'s there for every American,\" he said.\\nThe lone abortion clinic in Mississippi is warning the U.S. Supreme Court that any move to undermine a half century of legal precedent affirming abortion rights would diminish the court\\'s credibility and lead to a national \"upheaval\" with sweeping consequences for millions of American women. \"People would be harmed, and chaos would ensue, even in states that claim not to be prohibiting abortion directly,\" attorneys for Jackson Women\\'s Health wrote the court in a brief filed Monday. The court later this year is expected to revisit a pair of longstanding but controversial decisions that have allowed states to regulate -- but not ban -- abortions before fetal viability, which is around 23-24 weeks, according to medical experts. Mississippi passed a law in 2018 attempting to ban all abortions after 15 weeks, but lower courts blocked the measure citing Supreme Court precedent from Roe v. Wade in 1973 and Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992. The state has asked the justices to overturn those decisions. \"Unless the court is to be perceived as representing nothing more than the preferences of its current membership, it is critical that judicial protection hold firm absent the most dramatic and unexpected changes in law or fact,\" attorneys for the abortion providers wrote the court. \"Two generations (of women) -- spanning almost five decades -- have come to depend on the availability of legal abortion, and the right to make this decision has been further cemented as critical to gender equality,\" they wrote. The appeal comes on the heels of the court\\'s 5-4 decision this month allowing Texas to effectively ban most abortions across the state, despite what the majority called \"serious questions\" about the constitutionality of the law. \"While Texas is circumventing Roe and the Constitution, Mississippi is openly asking the court to overturn Roe,\" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Jackson Women\\'s Health and is leading the legal challenge against SB8 in Texas. \"If the court grants Mississippi\\'s request to overturn Roe, large swaths of the South and Midwest -- where abortion is already hard to access -- will eliminate abortion completely,\" she said. Eleven states have passed so-called \"trigger laws\" that would immediately ban all or nearly all abortions if Roe were overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute. At the heart of the Mississippi case is a delicate balance the court has attempted to strike in its decisions over the years between a woman\\'s individual liberty and a state\\'s interest in protecting an unborn fetus. The line devised by the court has been viability. \"Before that point, the court concluded, no state interest is strong enough to outweigh the woman\\'s liberty interest in deciding whether to carry her pregnancy to term,\" attorneys for Jackson Women\\'s Health explained in their brief. Mississippi has advocated for jettisoning the viability standard but, critics said, not proposed a clear alternative for the court to adopt instead. \"Scientific advances show that an unborn child has taken on the human form and features months before viability. States should be able to act on those developments,\" the state told the court in July. \"But Roe and Casey shackle states to a view of the facts that is decades out of date.\" Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, in a statement responding to the Jackson Women\\'s Health filing, argued that the court\\'s current standard as become \"flawed and hopelessly unworkable precedent\" and said the justices should give states greater deference in \"address(ing) abortion policy in a way that empowers women and promotes life.\" Approximately 100 women per year in Mississippi seek abortions after 15 weeks, the clinic said in court documents. Jackson Women\\'s Health only performs abortions up to 16 weeks. Attorneys for the clinic urge the justices to consider the human toll on millions of American women should they uphold the law or abolish Roe. They say forcing women to continue an unwanted pregnancy puts them at higher risk of health complications, emotional harm and financial strain. \"Accepting Mississippi\\'s request to abandon the viability line would turn back the clock for generations who have never known what it means to be without the fundamental right to make the decision whether to continue a pregnancy,\" they write. \"Until viability, a state may regulate, but not ban, abortion.\"\\nA short time ago, during a live moment celebrating the 10th anniversary of Aulani, A Disney Resort & Spa, we debuted a new mele or song, \"\\'Aulani, Lei Hiwahiwa\" written and performed by two of our very own Aulani cast members: Angela Morales and Eric Lee.

Today, I would like to introduce you to an adorable baby white rhino, born to first-time mom Jao backstage at Disneys Animal Kingdom Theme Park. Mom and baby are doing great under the keepers watchful and joyful eyes. I am happy to report that the beautiful calf snuggled up to mom and began nursing right away. While we give Jao and her baby boy ample time to bond, it will be a little while before we know the calfs weight. Typically, white rhino calves can weigh as much as 140 pounds at birth. Did you know that the majestic rhinos are the worlds second largest land animal? Rhinoceros also have one of the longest gestation periods of any mammal - approximately 16 to 18 months. Our animal care teams veterinarians, scientists and animal keepers kept a close eye on Jao throughout her pregnancy, conducting regular checkups and ultrasounds to ensure a safe birth. Jao was paired with dad Dugan, the bull of the herd, through one of the Species Survival Plans, which are overseen by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to ensure the responsible breeding of endangered species. This birth is a true milestone for this endangered species. And our herd continues to grow. This delivery marks the 12th rhino born at Disney, and the second rhino born in the last year. And even more hooves are on the horizon as another first-time mom, Lola, is expected to give birth this fall. In the coming weeks, Jao and baby are expected to join the \"crash\" (a group of rhinos), in their habitat on the Harambe Wildlife Reserve where park guests can catch a glimpse of the herd while aboard Kilimanjaro Safaris. Be sure to check the Disney Parks Blog as we will continue to share updates on these rhino births and more animal news!\\nAre you a teacher? Do you inspire imagination in your classroom?

It was such an honor to announce Lily Chan and Tony Dick as the first Disney Ambassador team ever to represent Hong Kong Disneyland Resort! I cant put into words how touching it was to see all six finalists come together with their families and friends to celebrate such a historic occasion. Lily and Tony are both incredible and are the perfect combination as our next Disney Ambassadors. Born and raised in Hong Kong, Lily grew a passion for Hong Kong Disneyland and become a full time cast member as soon as she graduated. I met Lily through Disney VoluntEARS, where she is an active member. She frequently spends her free time helping in the community and the resort in many different ways. She is also unbelievably creative and knows how to effectively execute her ideas - which can be seen from the video she produced as part of the Ambassador selection process! Tony grew up in South Africa and came to Hong Kong Disneyland to pursue his dream of being a singer. Ive always been a huge fan of watching him perform on stage, from Festival of the Lion King to our new castle show, Follow Your Dreams. His energy and charisma always get the crowd excited! And after getting to know more about him, Ive found him to be very humble, knowledgeable and always full of great ideas. Most importantly, I couldnt be more proud to be passing the Disney Ambassador pin to these two. They have exactly what it takes to continue Walts legacy and will both be shining stars for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Im looking forward to hearing more from them and cant wait to see where their magical journey takes them in serving our cast and the local community. Congratulations Lily and Tony!

After announcing their lawsuit last week, the U.S. Department of Justice Tuesday evening filed for an immediate injunction to halt Texas\\' enforcement of their restrictive law banning most abortions in the state. \"The State of Texas adopted S.B. 8 to prevent women from exercising their constitutional rights,\" the DOJ says in their motion. \"This attempt to shield a plainly unconstitutional law from review cannot stand. The United States seeks a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction enjoining the enforcement of S.B. 8.\" Department officials wrote that the order \"is necessary to protect the constitutional rights of women in Texas and the sovereign interest of the United States in ensuring that its States respect the terms of the national compact,\" adding that \"it is also necessary to protect federal agencies, employees, and contractors whose lawful actions S.B. 8 purports to prohibit.\" \"The United States has the authority and responsibility to ensure that Texas cannot insulate itself from judicial review for its constitutional violations and to protect the important federal interests that S.B. 8 impair,\" the DOJ\\'s motion says. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced last week that the Justice Department had filed a lawsuit against the state of Texas, challenging its abortion law. The move set up a high-stakes legal battle after the Supreme Court allowed the law to go into effect earlier this month. Garland also said at the time that the DOJ was seeking an immediate court order preventing the enforcement of SB8 in Texas. The lawsuit accuses Texas lawmakers of enacting the law -- which bans physicians from providing abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, or as soon as six weeks into a pregnancy, and does not contain exceptions for cases of rape or incest -- \"in open defiance of the Constitution.\" And in a press conference, Garland said Texas Republicans are crafting a \"statutory scheme\" through the law \"to nullify the Constitution of the United States.\" It\\'s unclear when the judge might rule on the DOJ\\'s emergency request.\\nCalifornia has voted not to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom, according to a projection from ABC News based on exit polls and an analysis of votes. With 65% of the expected vote reported so far, 66% of electors in Tuesday\\'s special election are against recalling the Democratic governor. \"I\\'m humbled and grateful to the millions and millions of Californians that exercise their fundamental right to vote, and express themselves so overwhelmingly by rejecting the division by rejecting the cynicism,\" Newsom said late Tuesday night in his victory speech. \"By rejecting, so much of the negativity that\\'s defined our politics in this country over the course of so many years.\" Californians were faced with a two-part question -- if they would like to recall Newsom and who they would like to replace him with if he was recalled. Newsom needed more than 50% of voters to vote against recalling him to keep his job as the top executive of the most populous state. Forty-six candidates were competing to replace him, and while the question is moot, nationally syndicated conservative radio host Larry Elder -- the frontrunner going into the election -- leads that pack with 44% of the vote currently. In post-election remarks, Elder conceded the recall was unsuccessful. \"Let\\'s be gracious in defeat,\" Elder said, after he was met with boos when he referenced Newsom by name. \"We may have lost the battle, but we are going to win the war.\" This is the fourth time in the nation\\'s history that voters have had an election to recall their governor, and only one governor has been recalled in the last century. In 2003, Democratic California Gov. Gray Davis, facing extremely low approval ratings, was recalled and replaced with former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. This time, Republicans have a crowded primary field and, before nationally syndicated conservative radio host Larry Elder\\'s entrance into the race, the field was without a clear leader. Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer was once thought to be the front-runner and is seen as the moderate in the race. Businessman John Cox, who was the GOP\\'s gubernatorial nominee in 2018, campaigned across the state with a live bear and an 8-foot ball of trash. Reality star and Olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner entered the recall field, although she spent some time out of the country in Australia, reportedly filming a celebrity edition of a reality show. Going into the election, numbers appeared to be in the incumbent\\'s favor, but Newsom still recruited some of the biggest Democratic heavy-hitters to stump for him, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. President Joe Biden hit the trail with Newsom to close out his campaign in Long Beach, California, on Monday night. \"This is not hyperbole. The eyes of the nation are on California because the decision you\\'re about to make isn\\'t just going to have a huge impact on California, it\\'s going to reverberate around the nation, and quite frankly not a joke around the world,\" Biden said Monday. According to preliminary exit polls, 55% of voters participating in this election approved of how Newsom is handling his job as governor. In 2003, exit polls showed Davis\\' approval rating at 26% -- a stark difference from how the voters perceive the current governor. Historically, gubernatorial recalls produce similar vote margins for the governor holding office as they had in their last election, according to recall expert and senior fellow at Wagner College, Joshua Spivak. Gray Davis got 47% of the vote in 2002, and 44% in 2003 when he was recalled. In Wisconsin in 2010, Scott Walker was elected with 52.2% of the vote, and defeated his recall with 53.1%. In 2018, Newsom won the state with 61.9% of the vote to GOP nominee John Cox\\'s 38.1%. In 2020, Biden carried with a similar margin, 63.5% of the vote to Trump\\'s 34.3%. Democratic voter registration in the Golden State largely outpaces that of both Republicans and independents, putting Newsom at an advantage. So far, Democrats are leading both groups combined when it comes to returning their ballots: Democrats have returned nearly 4.1 million compared to the 3.8 million Republican and independent ballots that have been returned, according Monday data from Political Data Inc. Democrats have attempted to nationalize the race to increase enthusiasm, warning of lawmaking similar to that of Republican-led states. Harris, a native of the Bay Area, rallied with Newsom on Thursday and warned of the national consequences the recall could have if it was successful, referencing the recent change in abortion laws in Texas, among other things. \"What\\'s happening in Texas, what\\'s happening in Georgia, what\\'s happening around our country with these policies that are about attacking women\\'s rights, reproductive rights, voting rights, workers rights, they think if they can win in California they can do this anywhere, but we\\'re gonna show them they can\\'t,\" Harris said. In preliminary exit polls, a plurality (31%) of voters said the pandemic was the most important issue facing the Golden State, and Newsom spent the campaign warning voters about potential policy changes surrounding the coronavirus if the recall passed. His team released an ad painting the election as \"life or death,\" and the governor singled out Elder\\'s promises that he would immediately end mask mandates and testing for state employees. Preliminary exit polls also showed support for Newsom\\'s coronavirus policies. Only about 3 in 10 voters feel that mitigation measures put in place by the governor are too strict, and 7 in 10 support the state requiring students wear masks in schools Additionally, the vast majority of voters feel the pandemic is either getting better (39%) or staying the same (31%), rather than getting worse (24%). Ahead of the election, Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, were already baselessly raising the alarm about the potential for voter fraud, based on conspiracies about the 2020 election. Trump claimed that the election was \"totally rigged,\" even though the state has been reliably Democratic for decades, voting against Republican presidential candidates in every election since 1992. Elder warned of \"shenanigans\" last week -- though he told ABC News Saturday, \"So many people are going to vote to have it recalled, I\\'m not worried about fraud.\" Elder previously said he believed Biden won the 2020 election \"fairly and squarely.\" But he was encouraging his supporters to call a hotline to report issues of voter fraud for litigation purposes in the recall, saying he fears there will be integrity issues similar to those of the 2020 election -- despite there being no widespread evidence of voter fraud in November. Even before results were released, Elder had a link on his website -- which has seemingly since been removed -- asking visitors to sign a petition \"demanding a special session of the California legislature to investigate and ameliorate the twisted results of this 2021 Recall Election of Governor Gavin Newsom.\"\\nA British court on Wednesday indicated that it intends to formally provide notice to Prince Andrew of a sexual assault lawsuit filed against him in New York, according to a court statement and documents obtained by ABC News. \"The legal process has not yet been served but the High Court will now take steps to serve under the [Hague] Convention,\" a court spokesperson told Reuters in a statement. The court\\'s decision came over the objections of the prince\\'s legal team, who have argued that lawyers for the prince\\'s accuser, Virginia Giuffre, are not authorized to receive assistance from the U.K. courts to serve a summons on the prince. Giuffre, 38, sued the prince in a U.S. federal court last month, accusing the prince of sexually assaulting her in 2001 at the Manhattan home of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and at other locations. The prince has denied her allegations. In an email sent and obtained Wednesday by ABC News, Gary Bloxsome -- lawyer for the prince -- insisted that the request for service from Giuffre\\'s lawyers was \"contrary\" to British law. Bloxsome contended that granting the request amounted to \"an infringement of UK sovereignty,\" according to the email Bloxsome sent to special master Barbara Fontaine, a British judicial official. In response, Fontaine told Bloxsome that if the prince\\'s team wished to contest her determination, they should do so by requesting a formal hearing. \"I do not consider that it is appropriate for me to determine this disputed issue by email,\" Fontaine wrote in an email to Bloxsome. The British court\\'s decision comes just two days after a lawyer for Prince Andrew appeared in a New York court to argue that the 61-year-old son of Britain\\'s Queen Elizabeth II had not been legally served with notice of Giuffre\\'s lawsuit. The attorney, Andrew Brettler, assailed the case as \"baseless, non-viable and potentially unlawful.\" Brettler has not responded to an email request for comment from ABC News. A lawyer for Giuffre said Wednesday that he regards the myriad objections of Prince Andrew\\'s legal team as an effort to delay or avoid the prince having to face the allegations in court. \"I think that their continued intransigence here is something that ultimately goes to their credibility; I think ultimately makes clear that they don\\'t have any confidence in their defense on the merits,\" said David Boies, chairman of the New York-based law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, which represents Giuffre. U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who is overseeing Giuffre\\'s case against the prince, has set a hearing for next month to determine if the prince has been legally and lawfully served with notice of the lawsuit.\\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday released data from Pfizer\\'s application for COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. In it, the company presents what it considers proof that a third shot will be both safe and effective for most adults, arguing that immunity wanes over time and has so far not been linked to any particular variant. In a 53-page briefing submitted to the FDA, the pharmaceutical company makes the case that it\\'s time to \"restore\" full protection from the COVID-19 vaccines, even though they are still protecting most vaccinated people from being hospitalized. The data comes two days ahead of a critical juncture in the COVID-19 vaccine booster approval process: On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration\\'s independent advisory committee is set to hold a public hearing to discuss the latest data on potential booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine. The committee is then expected to vote on whether a booster dose is safe enough for widespread use -- and whether it\\'s necessary and effective at improving protection levels. In a review of Pfizers data also released Wednesday, the FDA appeared to be noncommittal on the necessity for boosters. The agency pointed out that Pfizer\\'s efficacy data could be hampered by the limitations of studying boosters in real-world situations, which can introduce complicating factors. \"There are many potentially relevant studies, but FDA has not independently reviewed or verified the underlying data or their conclusions,\" the agency wrote in its briefing. Still, the upshot of the Pfizer data published Wednesday is that protection against breakthrough infection wanes over time and that a booster brings the immune response back up to a \"robust\" level. \"These data suggest that a third dose could re-establish the efficacy levels shown one month after two doses, prolong duration of protection, and further increase the breadth of protection,\" the Pfizer document read. Pfizer also reported that there were no safety concerns during its clinical trials of booster shots, which followed around 320 participants for up to three months. The FDA, in its review, said the reactions to the booster doses \"were not substantially different\" from reactions people had to their second shots. There were no reports of two heart conditions -- myocarditis or pericarditis -- linked to the boosters, even though they have been linked on very rare occasions to mRNA coronavirus vaccines in the days after the second dose, particularly among young men. Nearly 2 million people in the U.S. have already received boosters, though the approval process for the general public is just getting underway. In mid-August, the FDA authorized boosters of Moderna and Pfizer for the roughly 7 million immunocompromised Americans who didn\\'t get an optimal immune response to their initial vaccine doses. And Pfizer/BioNTech, which partnered to develop the nation\\'s first fully approved vaccine, has repeatedly said that booster shots six to 12 months after the second dose will help maintain a high level of protection. Pfizer asked the FDA to approve booster doses of its vaccine in late August by submitting an application and data, which started the process. On Wednesday morning, the FDA made that data public. While Pfizer\\'s own data shows a decrease from an initial 96% efficacy to 83.7% efficacy after four months, the company also cited data from a study by Kaiser Permanente Southern California, which found that efficacy against infections declined from 88% during the first month after full vaccination to 47% after five months. But Pfizer acknowledged that U.S. data has yet to show a strong erosion of protection against hospitalization, and instead relied heavily on data from Israel, which is a few months ahead of the U.S. in its vaccine process, to make the case that the U.S. could soon see breakthrough infections that lead to serious illness and hospitalization. The Israel data cited by Pfizer found that the risk of breakthrough infection was 53% higher for people who received their vaccines earliest in the rollout. The data also found over two times higher risk of breakthrough infection for people vaccinated in January versus people vaccinated four months later, in April. That Pfizer relied on Israel\\'s data is likely to raise more questions during Friday\\'s FDA advisory committee meeting about whether the U.S. has enough data on its own population to recommend boosters -- a point of division in the booster debate. But Pfizer also made the point that even waning protection against mild infection is reason to act because it could lead to further spread ahead of the fall and winter flu season. \"Policymakers will need to continue to monitor [vaccine efficacy] over time and may need to consider recommendations for booster doses to restore initial high levels of protection observed early in the vaccination program, and to help control heightened transmission of [delta] as we enter the upcoming fall/winter viral respiratory season,\" Pfizer wrote. While votes from the independent members of the FDA\\'s advisory committee, called VRBPAC, are not binding, the agency takes its recommendations under serious advisement in deciding whether to grant vaccines new authorization or approval. While the Biden administration is planning for booster shots to be made available as soon as next week, if and when a recommendation does come to green light booster shots, there are several additional steps before Americans roll up their sleeves for a third time. First, the FDA would need to formally amend its current vaccine approval for Pfizer. Then, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s advisory committee will weigh in as to when to begin administering expanded booster shots and to whom they should be given. The last step is for the CDC director to formally sign off on whether to recommend the vaccine to the public, including who to suggest it for and when. Pfizer was the first to submit data, but authorization for Moderna and Johnson & Johnson may not be far behind. While J&J has yet to release more information, Moderna on Wednesday said it would request authorization for a booster dose six months after the primary vaccination, based on newly-published data from its Phase 3 trial showing a lower risk of breakthrough infections among people vaccinated eight months ago compared to people vaccinated 13 months ago. Unlike Pfizer, Modernas third booster will be a half-dose. They say their data shows that boosting with a half-shot seems to generate more than enough immune response. But the process will begin with Pfizer, the first to have all its data in. Friday\\'s FDA meeting comes just days before the Sept. 20 date set by the White House as the target to begin deploying booster shots for a wider pool of Americans. The question of whether America\\'s immunity is waning has become an urgent question in recent months with the rise of the delta variant as large pockets of the country remain unvaccinated. FDA acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky -- both White House appointees -- endorsed Biden\\'s Sept. 20 plan. But it has received some pushback, with health experts criticizing the Sept. 20 boosters-for-all timeline as premature. Two top FDA officials who are leaving the agency later this year publicly waded into the booster debate on Monday, splitting from the agency and arguing in a scientific journal that it was too soon to give booster shots to the general public since the vaccines still offer strong protection against serious disease. Both are scheduled to attend Friday\\'s discussion. \"The message that boosting might soon be needed, if not justified by robust data and analysis, could adversely affect confidence in vaccines and undermine messaging about the value of primary vaccination,\" wrote the officials, who are backed by other worldwide organizations. For its part, the Biden administration has emphasized that science will lead, that federal regulators will have the final say and that the call for booster shots is motivated by a desire to \"stay ahead\" of the virus. \"You don\\'t want to find yourself behind playing catch up,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\\'s top infectious disease expert, said when announcing the plan. \"Better stay ahead of it than chasing after it.\"\\nFrench officials announced overnight that their military forces had killed the top ISIS leader in Africa, a terrorist for whom the United States had offered a $5 million reward due to his connection to the deadly attack on a team of Green Berets in Niger four years ago. French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Twitter that Adnan Abou Walid al-Sahrawi, the leader of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, was \"neutralized by French forces.\" \"This is another major success in our fight against terrorist groups in the Sahel,\" Macron said of the region in northwest Africa. The drone strike occurred in late August but al-Sahrawi\\'s death was confirmed this month, French and U.S. counterterrorism officials told ABC News. Al-Sahrawi was wanted by the U.S. for leading the group of more than 100 militants responsible for attacking Operational Detachment-Alpha 3212, a team of soldiers from 3rd Special Forces Group on Oct. 4, 2017, leaving four Americans and at least six Nigerien soldiers dead outside the tiny village of Tongo Tongo. The 2017 ambush is the subject of a four-year ABC News investigation and an ABC Documentaries film set for release on Hulu in November, \"3212 UN-REDACTED: An Ambush In Africa. The Pentagons Betrayal.\" Macron did not explicitly say that France\\'s anti-insurgent Task Force Barkhane in Mali had been assisted by U.S. intelligence, but sources in Paris and in Africa confirmed that was the case. American intelligence had previously assisted in numerous raids carried out by French Special Forces in 2018 that killed many of the Tongo Tongo attackers and recovered American weapons and one vehicle from the Green Beret team attacked in 2017. The parents of U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Jeremiah Johnson, who was killed in action in the 2017 attack and decorated with the Bronze Star Medal with \"V\" for Valor, praised the French but said the U.S. should have taken the lead on al-Sahrawi\\'s capture or killing. \"We are profoundly grateful to the French Armed Forces for removing this threat to West Africa. At the same time, we are disappointed that the United States did not exert the effort to bring this individual to justice,\" Johnson\\'s mother and stepfather, Debbie and Ray Gannon, told ABC News in a statement. \"We should have made the effort to either kill or capture the individuals who were responsible for the ambush of ODA 3212 ourselves, instead of relying on other countries.\" Also killed in the 2017 attack were Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright of Lyons, Georgia, Sgt. LaDavid Johnson of Miami, and Staff Sgt. Bryan Black of Puyallup, Washington. \"More death does not make losing Bryan any better. But knowing there is one less evil man in this world brings me peace,\" said Michelle Black, who authored the book \"Sacrifice: A Gold Star Widow\\'s Fight For The Truth,\" about her husband and the Tongo Tongo gunfight. \"Perhaps it will prevent other families from suffering terror at his hands and for me that is enough.\" Bryan Black\\'s parents, Henry and Karen Black, also were grateful for the French operation, she said. In a ceremony for all four families of the fallen soldiers in July, LaDavid Johnson and Jeremiah Johnson, both support soldiers who were killed with the Green Beret team, were posthumously inducted into the Green Berets. \"Although nothing can take away the pain of losing our four fallen heroes, there is comfort in knowing that justice has been served,\" said former Green Beret Maj. Alan Van Saun, who was company commander of the ambushed detachment ODA 3212, and who appears in the ABC documentary film. \"I am grateful for our French and African partners who worked tirelessly to bring this chapter to an end, but I know there is still a lot of work to be done to bring stability to the Sahel,\" Van Saun told ABC News. The French Defense Ministry said that the operation was conducted between Aug. 17-22, in partnership with the Malian armed forces, against ISIS fighters in the Dangerous Forest area south of the village of In Delimane in Mali\\'s Liptako region. A senior French commander told ABC News that al-Sahrawi was \"weakened after the loss of two of his logistics commanders in the same period,\" after the French neutralized Rhissa al-Sarhaoui and the commander known as Ikarey. The French commander told ABC News that, based on U.S. intelligence, \"we understood al-Sahrawi left Menaka on a motorbike and was about to cross the Nigerien border.\" Al-Sahrawi was then targeted by a drone airstrike that killed the ISIS leader and resulted in the captured of ten of his men, French and U.S. officials said. \"This zone is a red one. Almost a stateless area. This is a huge get and could rebalance the power at least for the Malian Liptako,\" said the French commander, who added that confirming al-Sahrawi\\'s death \"took several weeks.\" \"The killing of al-Sahrawi follows a series of tactical successes by the French, who recently killed or captured several senior ISGS [Islamic State in the Greater Sahara] commanders,\" said Sahel expert Heni Nsaibia of the risk consultancy firm Menastream. \"It appears that these events and the question of who will succeed al-Sahrawi have created serious tensions within ISGS. We are talking about numerous No. 1- and 2-ranking commanders eliminated in just months. This means that it will be difficult for the group to effectively restructure and reorganize at this point.\" In a statement, Macron paid tribute to France\\'s fallen troops in northwest Africa. \"The Nation is thinking this evening of all its heroes who died for France in the Sahel ... of the bereaved families, of all of its wounded,\" Macron said. \"Their sacrifice is not in vain. With our African, European and American partners, we will continue this fight.\"\\nTrump doesn\\'t have to run in 2024 to continue to dominate talk and realities. The TAKE with Rick Klein Democrats feel like they just beat former President Donald Trump again, after a California blowout where Gov. Gavin Newsom framed the recall race explicitly against Trumpism. But Trump has not and is not going anywhere -- and the aftershocks of his presidency continue to be felt across both parties and inside the White House. President Joe Biden is dealing with a chunk of the fallout regarding the actions of Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose conduct in the final days of the Trump administration are explored in the new book by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of The Washington Post. Congress and law-enforcement agencies are coping with the consequences of Trump\\'s election lies, with fencing going up around the Capitol overnight in preparation for this weekend\\'s rally in support of Jan. 6 rioters. And while Larry Elder isn\\'t pursuing previous threats of challenging the legitimacy of the election, Tuesday\\'s recall results offer a new reminder of both Trump\\'s potency and potential limits. Overlooked in coverage of Newsom\\'s landslide was Elder\\'s dominance among the replacement candidates. His brand of Trumpism sold among those who wanted Newsom gone - but didn\\'t fly among the independent and Democratic voters he would have needed to get Newsom replaced. The question of whether Trump runs again looms over just about all 2024 conversations these days. But he doesn\\'t have to run to continue to dominate talk and realities. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper In devastating testimony in Congress Wednesday, Olympic gymnasts highlighted a system they say failed them as they reported sexual abuse at the hands of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. In disturbing detail, Simone Biles, McKayla Maroney, Maggie Nichols and Aly Raisman shared their stories of sexual assault by Nassar, who is serving up to 175 years in prison. The elite athletes also accused USA gymnastics and the FBI grossly mishandling the investigations. \"They quietly allowed Nassar to slip out the side door, knowingly allowing him to continue his work. ... Nassar found more than 100 new victims to molest,\" said Raisman. \"It was like serving innocent children up to a pedophile, on a silver platter.\" Their claims were corroborated by a scathing Justice Department inspector general report which says two FBI field offices failed to respond adequately, allegedly giving Nassar the time to abuse 70 young athletes over 15 months. FBI Director Christopher Wray, who was not leading the agency at the time, offered an apology. \"I\\'m sorry that so many different people let you down over and over again. And I\\'m especially sorry that there were people at the FBI who had their own chance to stop this monster back in 2015 and failed,\" said Wray. The women said they shared their stories in hopes of accountability for those who turned a blind eye, but the outcome is uncertain. DOJ has twice declined to prosecute FBI officials who were called out for misconduct in the report. The TIP with Alisa Wiersema A few months shy of the one-year marker of Biden\\'s 2020 presidential victory, Pennsylvania Republicans are laying the groundwork to review last year\\'s general election. Although Biden won Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes -- nearly double the margin of Trump\\'s 2016 win in the same state -- on Wednesday, state Republicans voted to subpoena the Pennsylvania Department of State for personal information about every registered voter to examine if voter fraud occurred last fall. According to state Sen. Cris Dush who is leading the probe, the intent is to investigate allegations about the \"validity of people who have voted\" rather than who they voted for. There is no indication that any widespread fraud occurred. This much has been indicated by Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman last year following the election. Still, Corman has also indicated that perceived issues with the way the election was administered should be reviewed. The development in Pennsylvania is the latest of several states\\' efforts to attempt to relitigate the outcome of the 2020 election through baseless claims of widespread voter fraud propagated by Trump. The review will unfold against the backdrop of what is expected to be the nation\\'s most high-profile Senate race, further adding to the heated partisanship of the upcoming campaign cycle.

Gavin Newsom handily survived this weeks recall election that could have removed him from office SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom handily defeated a recall election that could have removed him from office, but his Democratic allies in the Legislature already are seeking changes that could make it harder to mount such a challenge in the future. Those changes could include raising the standard to require wrongdoing on the part of the officeholder, increasing the number of signatures needed to force a recall election, and changing the process that could permit someone with a small percentage of votes to replace the states top elected official. \"I think the recall process has been weaponized,\" Newsom said Wednesday, a day after his decisive victory. He added that the recall rules also affect school boards, city councils, county supervisors and district attorneys, notably in Los Angeles and San Francisco, where progressive prosecutors with reform agendas are facing recall efforts. The governor noted that California has one of the nations lowest thresholds for the number of signatures needed to trigger a recall election. In Newsoms case, recall proponents had to collect nearly 1.5 million signatures out of 22 million registered voters in their bid to oust him, or 12% of the electorate who voted him into office in 2018. By contrast, Kansas requires 40%. But the efforts faced pushback from those who organized the recall election against Newsom and questions from experts, who said Californias law is better than many others in limiting requirements that make it harder to recall politicians. \"Theyre working in opposition of the will of the people when they take action like that to limit our ability to self-govern,\" said Orrin Heatlie, chief proponent of the recall effort. There is little benefit for Democrats in pushing changes that could anger voters, said Joshua Spivak, an expert on recalls and senior fellow at the Hugh L. Carey Institute for Government Reform in New York. \"From a political point of view, its kind of crazy, and I cant imagine why they would spend political capital on this,\" Spivak said. \"Are you going to go to the voters and say, \\'Well, we didnt deal with the homeless problem but yeah, we fixed the recall? It just doesnt seem like a smart move.\" State Sen. Josh Newman, who was recalled in 2018 before regaining his seat two years later, said he will propose two constitutional amendments: one to raise the number of required signatures and another to have the lieutenant governor finish the governors term if a recall succeeds. \"We need to create a system where a small, small, small minority of Californians cant create, cant initiate a recall that the California taxpayers spent almost $300 million on and that frankly distracts and really has an impact on our ability to govern for nine months,\" Democratic Assemblyman Marc Berman said. Newsom on Tuesday became only the second governor in U.S. history to defeat a recall; the other was Wisconsin Republican Scott Walker in 2012. The win cements him as a prominent figure in national Democratic politics and ensures that the nations most populous state remains a laboratory for progressive policies. With an estimated 74% of ballots counted, the \"no\" response to the question of whether to recall Newsom was ahead by a 28-point margin. At the Capitol, Berman and Sen. Steven Glazer, who head the Legislature\\'s elections panels, promised bipartisan hearings in the coming months, with the goal of proposing constitutional changes sometime after lawmakers reconvene in January. Changes to the recall law must be approved by voters. GOP Assemblyman Kelly Seyarto, vice chairman of the elections committee, said Republicans will seek to ensure the proposals protect voters ability to hold politicians accountable. The two elections committees will look at recall laws in other states and hear from experts on Californias process. Nineteen states have some sort of recall process, Glazer said, but only Colorado has a similar two-stage process. The California system asks voters first whether they want to remove the incumbent. Then, if a majority favors removal, the candidate who gets the most votes on the second question becomes governor. In this weeks race, 46 candidates were on the ballot. In the majority of other recall states, he said, the only question on the ballot is whether the official should be recalled. If a majority of voters say yes, the office is then declared vacant and filled by appointment or a separate special election. Changes have the backing of the California Legislatures two leaders, both Democrats, and their party holds two-thirds majorities in both chambers. But the final decision will come down to voters because the recall process was enshrined in the state Constitution in 1911. \"This is a system that was set up about a century ago and to the extent to which its still valid in its current form, it needs to be looked at for sure,\" Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said. A Public Policy Institute of California survey in July found that 86% of California likely voters approve of having a way to recall elected officials, a sentiment that transcends political parties, regions, and demographic groups. But two-thirds of likely voters also supported major or minor changes, though Republicans and Democrats split over the extent of the changes. ------ See APs recall coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/california-recall\\nJohn Getreu was on trial for the murder of college student Janet Taylor. Forty-eight years after the original crime, it took a San Mateo County, California, jury a little more than an hour Tuesday to find John Arthur Getreu guilty of murdering 21-year-old Janet Ann Taylor. Taylor, a college sophomore, was the youngest daughter of legendary Stanford University football coach, Chuck Taylor. She had been beaten, strangled and left on the side of the road near the Stanford campus, according to authorities. Her body was discovered by a truck driver on March 24, 1974. Getreu, 77, worked at Stanford at the time of her murder. He has also been charged in the 1973 murder of Stanford graduate, Leslie Perlov, and will be tried next year. He has pleaded not guilty in that case. Watch the full story on \"20/20\" FRIDAY at 9 p.m. ET on ABC Cold case detectives used genetic genealogy to identify Getreu in what prosecutor Josh Stauffer described as a sexually-motivated crime in the strangulation of Taylor. He told jurors that Getreu was a man who lived two lives as a Palo Alto, California, Boy Scout leader and family man, but also a predator and previously convicted rapist and murderer. In his closing statements, Stauffer referenced Getreus two previous known victims: Diane Doe, a 17-year-old rape victim, and 15-year-old Margaret Williams, who Getreu killed in 1963 while living in Germany. The prosecutor told the jury all the cases and victims were strikingly similar to Taylor. \"He took her with the intent to rape her. He attacked her. Tore her clothes. Struck her in the face. Repeated punches to the face. He strangled her, \" recounted Stauffer. Getreus conviction marked an end to Taylors decades-old cold case for which advancements in DNA technology played a critical role. Getreus defense attorney, John Halley could not be reached for comment on the guilty verdict. In his closing statements, Halley asserted that the prosecution had not proved Getreus guilt \"beyond reasonable doubt.\" Diane Perlov, Leslie Perlovs younger sister who flew in from Los Angeles to monitor the trial, was just leaving the courthouse when she was notified that the jury had reached a verdict. \"Today was justice for Janet, Leslie, Diane and Margaret,\" she said. \"While these promising lives are gone forever, thanks to the dogged work of detectives and the advances in forensic science, I have hope that future lives will be saved and other predators held accountable\" Outside the back of the courthouse, she embraced Santa Clara cold case detective Sgt. Noe Cortez, who had gathered crucial evidence in this case. \"This is not the end,\" Perlov said. \"We are moving forward. I want a trial for my sisters case. I dont want any deals. There were some really horrible photographs of what Getreu did to Janet and what he did to Leslie and I want everyone to see them so they understand what a dangerous person he is. \" When called for comment about todays verdict, Getreu\\'s only son Aaron Getreu asked to convey sympathy to Taylors family and all his fathers victims. \"My family had no clue about my fathers past and have nothing but sympathy for all of his victims,\" he said. \"We only knew him as a loving father and grandfather, but science doesnt lie. With this conviction I hope these families can now have closure.\" Grace Kahng is an investigative journalist, Emmy Award-winning documentary filmmaker and director of \"The Stanford Murders.\" Learn more at stanfordmurders.com.\\nWyoming\\'s governor says the state will ask the federal government to remove its protections for grizzly bears in the Yellowstone region CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Wyoming will ask the federal government to remove its protections for grizzly bears in the Yellowstone region and permit the region\\'s three states to manage and potentially allow hunting of the big bruins in certain areas, Gov. Mark Gordon said Thursday. \"We have proved time and time again that we are experts in wildlife conservation,\" Gordon, a Republican, said at a news conference. Wyoming will submit the request in the weeks ahead, Gordon said, after which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will have 90 days to determine whether delisting under the Endangered Species Act might be warranted in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. If the answer is yes, the agency would have a year to make a final decision on the request. Yellowstone\\'s grizzlies can reach 700 pounds (320 kilograms), not as big as their cousins in Alaska but much bigger than the black bears found across most of North America. Grizzlies wherever they appear are apex predators but also content to feed on berries and even moths. The Fish and Wildlife Service considers Yellowstones grizzlies \"biologically recovered.\" The Yellowstone region\\'s population has rebounded from about 100 in 1975, when they were first listed, to as many as 1,000 today. As they\\'ve recovered in number, the bears have been showing up ever farther and more frequently away from their core habitat in and near Yellowstone National Park. Even so, in March, the Fish and Wildlife Service as part of a five-year review recommended continuing threatened-species protections for grizzlies. The agency cited insufficient connection between the bears\\' best areas of habitat and people killing them, among other reasons. Lack of genetic diversity among the region\\'s bears remains a particular concern but Wyoming is willing to move bears around so that\\'s less of a problem, Gordon said. Wyoming and Idaho were planning grizzly hunts after President Donald Trumps administration removed protections for the bears. In 2018, a federal judge restored those protections, a decision upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020. Any future grizzly bear hunt in Wyoming would have strict limits, Wyoming Game and Fish Department Director Brian Nesvik said at the news conference. As things stand, the department each year has to kill as many as 35 grizzly bears that kill livestock, raid food on people\\'s property or cause other problems with humans, Nesvik pointed out. \"It just seems like a waste of a resource but thats really our only option right now,\" Nesvik said. Wyoming will take a \"first things first\" approach to the bears and hunting, said Gordon. \"Lets make sure they are delisted and then Game and Fish will do whatever it needs to do to follow up on that,\" Gordon said. Wyoming, Idaho and Montana can\\'t be trusted to manage grizzly bears, Center for Biological Diversity attorney Andrea Zaccardi said in a statement. \"Federal officials should reject this outrageous request, which aims to turn Wyomings imperiled grizzly bears into trophy hunting targets,\" Zaccardi said. ------ Follow Mead Gruver at https://twitter.com/meadgruver\\nA 14-month probe into the actions of the Aurora Police Department in Colorado following the death of Elijah McClain found the department \"has a pattern and practice of violating state and federal law through racially biased policing, using excessive force, and failing to record legally required information when interacting with the community,\" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said Wednesday. Investigators found that Aurora Police have used force against people of color almost two and a half times more than against white people based on their relative percentage of the population, according to the attorney general\\'s report. The report, which was conducted in response to the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, also found Aurora Police arrested people of color \"1.3 times more than whites based on population percentage alone.\" \"That multiplier was even greater for Black community members, who were arrested over two times more than whites,\" the attorney general\\'s office said in a statement. The Aurora Police Department said it will work with the AG to determine the best steps forward. \"Today is incredibly difficult for not only the Aurora community but this agency. We acknowledge there are changes to be made,\" Police Chief Vanessa Wilson said in a statement to ABC News. \"We will not broad brush this agency or discount the professionalism and integrity that individual officers bring to our community every day. \"I am proud to say the Aurora Police Department began the implementation of many changes over the last 21 months, while this and other investigations were ongoing. Those changes have improved overall policing, de-escalation training, community outreach and engagement,\" Wilson said. McClain, 23, was walking home when officers apprehended him in response to a 911 call of a suspicious person. McClain, who was wearing a ski mask at the time because, according to his family, he had anemia, told officers \"I have a right to go where I am going,\" according to body camera footage of the incident. The officers grabbed McClain and placed him in a carotid chokehold, according to investigators. McClain pleaded with them, saying he is non-violent, and can be heard in the body camera footage saying that he can\\'t breathe. When EMTs arrived at the scene, he was administered a shot of 500 milligrams of ketamine and was then loaded into an ambulance, where he had a heart attack, investigators said. He was declared brain dead at the hospital, and he died a few days later. Officers Randy Roedema, Nathan Woodyard and Jason Rosenblatt and fire department paramedic Jeremy Cooper and Lt. Peter Cichuniec were indicted earlier this month on 32 criminal counts, including manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The Aurora Police Association Board of Directors contended in a statement that the officers weren\\'t responsible for McClain\\'s death. \"The hysterical overreaction to this case has severely damaged the police department,\" it said. McClain\\'s death sparked protests throughout the city last year, some of which led to conflicts between protesters and the police. Lawmakers cited McClain\\'s death and other incidents of police misconduct when passing several reform bills last year, including one that authorizes the attorney general \"to investigate any governmental agency for engaging in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates state or federal constitutions or laws.\" Weiser\\'s investigation also revealed a lack of diversity among the force. Records indicate 1.1% of Black applicants -- roughly five out of 454 -- who met the minimum qualifications of the department were offered a job. Meanwhile, 4.2% of white applicants who met the same qualifications -- roughly 119 out of 2,809 -- were offered a job, according to police records. \"This level of racial winnowing can be observed at every step of the process, suggesting bias in Auroras recruitment and hiring process,\" the attorney general\\'s office said. The probe also examined the Aurora Fire Department\\'s use of ketamine between January 2019 to June 2020. The department suspended use of the drug on Sept. 14, 2020. The investigation found that in \"more than half the incidents, paramedics failed to follow ketamine monitoring protocols and administered ketamine at doses above the maximum allowable dose for the reported weight of the subject.\" The attorney general report said he highly recommends the city of Aurora enter a consent decree with the department to require changes to training, policies and record-keeping. The Colorado Department of Law and the city will have 60 days to find an agreement on a consent decree. Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman\\'s office didn\\'t immediately return messages for comment. \"Over the coming weeks, we look forward to working with Aurora and other stakeholders to create a consent decree that ensures these requirements are implemented promptly. We are encouraged by the city of Auroras interest in working with us to do so,\" Weiser said in a statement.\\nWomen driving hundreds of miles alone for an abortion, clinics overwhelmed with out-of-state patients, providers facing \"relentless harassment\" from \"emboldened vigilante activities,\" those are some of the impacts detailed by the federal government in new court documents since the most restrictive abortion law went into effect in Texas earlier this month. Nearly a week after announcing a lawsuit against the state, the U.S. Department of Justice filed for an immediate injunction Tuesday to halt the enforcement of the law, known as SB8, which bars physicians from providing abortions once they detect a so-called fetal heartbeat -- technically the flutter of electrical activity within the cells in an embryo. That can be seen on an ultrasound as early as six weeks into a pregnancy -- before many women even know they\\'re pregnant. In their latest filing, the DOJ documented the impact of the unprecedented law based on declarations from the leaders of women\\'s health clinics, doctors and abortion rights advocates in support of the motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. \"The devastating effects warned of in the pre-enforcement litigation immediately became a reality for patients and providers in Texas,\" the emergency motion states. \"S.B. 8 has gravely and irreparably impaired women\\'s ability to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion across the State.\" Under the law, between 85% and 95% of all abortions previously provided will stop, according to the motion. One Planned Parenthood affiliate in Texas went from providing 205 abortions the week before SB8 went into effect, to 52 the week after, according to the court documents. As a result, \"Women are being forced to travel hundreds -- and sometimes thousands -- of miles to obtain an abortion under harrowing circumstances in the middle of a COVID surge,\" the motion states. The DOJ recounted the experience of one patient, a minor, who was allegedly raped by a family member and traveled eight hours, from Galveston, Texas, to Oklahoma, for an abortion. There is an exception under the Texas law for abortions in cases of medical emergencies, but not for cases of incest or rape. \"[Other] survivors of sexual assault have to bear the additional burden of taking time off work and arranging childcare because abortions are not available in Texas,\" the motion states. According to the court documents, one patient drove a 1,000-mile roundtrip alone \"because she didn\\'t have paid time off work and couldn\\'t afford\" to miss her shift. Another \"piled her children into her car and drove over 15 hours overnight to obtain a medication abortion in Kansas rather than struggle to patch together the money needed for airfare and child care or remain in limbo,\" Anna Rupani, co-executive director of the advocacy group Fund Texas Choice, said in her declaration. One patient traveled six hours each way to Oklahoma alone because she was worried she would make someone liable for helping her, the court documents state. Under SB8, private citizens can sue a person they \"reasonably believed\" provided an illegal abortion or assisted someone in getting it in the state, such as by driving them to an appointment. On average, patients are traveling 650 miles each way to get to abortion clinics in the Southwest, according to the DOJ. The waits and logistical hurdles in planning travel to another state \"have made it such that some women are no longer eligible for a medication abortion and instead are subjected to more invasive procedural abortions,\" the motion states. SB8 not only affects Texans, but has had an \"extreme impact on the rights of women in other states,\" the motion argues. Clinics in nearby states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico and Colorado, have been \"overwhelmed\" by an influx of Texas residents seeking abortions, with clinics in Tulsa and Oklahoma City in particular seeing an \"overall staggering 646% increase\" in Texan patients compared to the first six months of the year, according to the court documents. Planned Parenthood health centers in Oklahoma are seeing scheduling backlogs of \"several weeks\" due to the number of Texan patients, while some clinics are simply unable to accommodate large numbers of out-of-state patients due to current demands and staffing challenges \"given the current threats from S.B. 8 layered atop the challenges of hiring in a pandemic,\" according to the court documents. Abortion clinic staff have also been impacted, the DOJ argues, as SB8 has \"emboldened vigilante activities\" against abortion providers and staff, including yelling at, recording and trying to follow them home.\" Staff are also concerned about the threat of potential lawsuits. Whole Woman\\'s Health, which has 17 doctors on staff across its three abortion facilities in Texas, reported that only one doctor \"unconditionally agreed to work\" after the law was enacted, according to the court documents. \"For most of our physicians, the risk was too great to even come to work,\" Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman\\'s Health, said in her declaration. Some clinics risk closure for good under the law, supporters of an immediate injunction said. \"If the law remains in effect for an extended period of time, and we are only able to serve a fraction of our patients with a fraction of our staff, we will have to shutter our doors and stop providing any healthcare to the communities we serve,\" Hagstrom Miller said. \"I believe that, without court-ordered relief in the next couple of weeks, S.B. 8 will shutter most if not all of the remaining abortion clinics in Texas.\"\\nThe missiles landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired two ballistic missiles toward the East Sea on Wednesday, according to South Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff. The missiles were launched from central North Korea and soared nearly 500 miles before landing in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. It\\'s the second time this week that the reclusive country has test-launched missiles. \"North Korea fired two unidentified ballistic missiles off its East Coast,\" the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea told ABC News in a statement Wednesday. \"South Korea and the U.S. intelligence are analyzing for details.\" The United States Indo-Pacific Command described the North Korean missile launch as \"destabilizing\" but said there was no \"immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory, or to our allies.\" \"We are aware of the missile launch and are consulting closely with our allies and partners,\" the command said in a statement Wednesday. \"While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory, or to our allies, the missile launch highlights the destabilizing impact of the DPRKs illicit weapons program. The U.S. commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad.\" Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the launch \"simply outrageous,\" condemning it as a \"threat to the peace and security\" of the region and a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban North Korea from engaging in any ballistic missile activities. \"We will work closely with the U.S., South Korea and other concerned nations to resolutely protect the lives of our citizens and their peaceful lives,\" Suga told reporters Wednesday. The missile launch came just two days after Pyongyang announced that it had fired a newly developed cruise missile twice over the weekend, marking the country\\'s first weapons test in six months. North Korean state media on Monday described the long-range missile as a \"strategic weapon of great significance.\" Analysts in Seoul saw the consecutive ballistic tests as a provocation on the heels of a strongly-worded statement released last month by Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. She criticized South Korea for taking part in an annual joint military drill with the United States and warned that \"a dear price will be paid.\" Nevertheless, Koh Yu-hwan, president of the Korea Institute for National Unification, a government-funded think tank in Seoul, said the recent missile tests posed \"no real threat to the U.S. mainland.\" \"North Korea is walking a tightrope of crossing the promise Kim Jong Un made with former [U.S.] President [Donald] Trump at the Singapore summit to refrain from firing long-range missiles or conducting nuclear experiments,\" Koh told ABC News on Wednesday. Cha Du Hyeogn, a visiting research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, an independent, non-profit think tank in Seoul, said the provocative launches were \"not surprising.\" \"We could see this as a low-intensity provocation in a short interval to call for the U.S. attention,\" Cha told ABC News on Wednesday. \"The communist state is trying to show the world that they are keen on developing a weapons system, but at the same time is being careful not to break the nuclear moratorium.\" North Korea has maintained a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests since 2017, but the country\\'s leader said in 2020 that he will no longer be bound by such restrictions. Pyongyang\\'s latest missile launch -- the fifth this year -- coincided with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi\\'s visit to Seoul, where he met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and other senior officials to discuss the stalled nuclear talks with the North. When asked by reporters for comment on the ballistic test, Wang emphasized the importance of resuming dialogue and bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula. China is North Korea\\'s last major ally and biggest source of aid and trade.\\nVoters gave Newsom more credit than blame for his handling of the pandemic. California Gov. Gavin Newsom would probably never have faced a recall election had it not been for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. He also might not have survived the recall had it not been for that very same reason. But on Tuesday, he did more than survive. Newsom used a powerful pair of somewhat related fears -- of pandemic backsliding, and one of a potential win for Trumpism -- to coast to victory. Newsom framed the recall less as an up-or-down vote on him and more about who could replace him: a far-right Republican, with all that that means, so long as former President Donald Trump is dominant in the GOP. While \"no\" on the recall question prevailed, Newsom framed his relatively muted victory speech Tuesday night around what he said the state voted for. \"We said yes to science, we said yes to vaccines, we said yes to ending this pandemic,\" Newsom said. \"We said yes to all those things we hold dear as Californians, and I would argue as Americans.\" Newsom and his fellow Democrats leaned in on COVID leadership and the need to take restrictions seriously. They also painted the leading Republican candidate in the race, Larry Elder, as what President Joe Biden called a \"Trump clone\" who would roll back pandemic mandates and halt progressive advances if given the chance. \"Trumpism is not dead in this country,\" Newsom said Tuesday night. Newsom\\'s easy triumph was no forgone conclusion, notwithstanding the friendly terrain of a state where President Joe Biden took the presidential contest by nearly 30 points less than a year ago. The recall effort took inspiration from Newsom\\'s early and aggressive COVID-19 restrictions. The effort was turbocharged by a viral photo last fall where Newsom was shown in seeming violation of his own lockdown restrictions -- dining at an ultra-exclusive French Laundry restaurant in Napa Valley, no less. Exit polls showed that COVID was indeed the top issue on voters\\' minds, outpacing the economy, crime, homelessness and wildfires. But Newsom wound up getting far more credit than blame for how he\\'s handled the pandemic. More than two-thirds of recall voters feel like the state\\'s coronavirus situation is either getting better or staying the same, according to preliminary exit polls. Forty-five percent said Newsom\\'s policies on the coronavirus have been about right, while another 18% actually said they haven\\'t been strict enough. Some 63% said they see getting vaccinated as more of a public health responsibility than a personal choice -- a broad endorsement of the Newsom-Biden point of view. And 70% support the state\\'s mandate that students wear masks in schools, which Newsom championed and his leading opponents promised to repeal. It contributed to an electorate where, despite the French Laundry incident, 54% of voters in the exit poll said Newsom was in touch with their concerns. Over in the other party, Newsom\\'s blowout might be spun by a beleaguered state GOP as unsurprising and unimportant. A recall miss is embarrassing -- just ask Democrats in Wisconsin -- though few key midterm races will feature electorates as deep blue as the Golden State\\'s. For all that, Republicans consolidated behind Elder, a conservative talk-show host with no previous political experience, with relative ease. Despite being dramatically outspent, Republicans managed to put at least a brief scare into state and national Democrats by taking on a rising star who won his job by 23 points less than three years ago. Elder, though, closed his campaign by playing into unfounded and somewhat predictable allegations of voter fraud. Trump amplified the baseless concerns by tying them back to his loss last year -- making it that much easier for Democrats to link Elder to Trump. The particular set of circumstances that contributed to this recall campaign are unlikely to present themselves again. Other races later this year -- most notably the governor\\'s race in Virginia in November -- may be better bellwethers for midterm races and beyond. But in this race at least, despite the inherent challenges of inspiring enthusiasm to maintain a status quo, Newsom and his party managed to have the campaign and the result they wanted. A famous Bidenism is a request: \"Don\\'t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative.\" That\\'s what Newsom asked for, and that\\'s what he got in earning the right to serve the last year of his term, if not more.\\nA witness had called police after seeing an altercation between the couple. Police in Utah have released body camera images of Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old woman who went missing during a cross-country road trip, and her boyfriend during an incident Aug. 12. The photos show Petito and her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, talking to an officer after her 2012 Ford Transit had been pulled over by Moab police. Another image shows Petito, who appears to be crying, sitting in the back of a police vehicle. On Aug. 12, police in Moab responded to an \"incident\" involving the couple, but \"insufficient evidence existed to justify criminal charges,\" Moab Police Department Chief Bret Edge said in a statement Tuesday night. Officers responded to a report of a domestic problem after a witness said the couple, involved in an altercation at the Arches National Park, drove off in a white van, according to a police report. When officers located a van and pulled it over for a traffic stop, the couple admitted to arguing and that Petito had slapped Laundrie, according to the report. The couple also stated to police that Laundrie did not hit Petito. Petito told police she suffers from severe anxiety and other medical conditions, which were redacted from the police report, and that the couple\\'s argument had been building for days. Police labeled the incident as a \"mental/emotional break\" rather than a domestic assault, according to the report. Police also are \"actively looking\" into a connection between Petito\\'s disappearance and a double homicide of two women that occurred in Grand County, Utah, on Aug. 13, the Grand County Sheriff\\'s Office announced Thursday. Investigators searching for Petito have expressed frustration that Petito\\'s boyfriend has not shed any light on her possible whereabouts. In June, Petito and Laundrie left on a trip from the Florida home they shared with Laundrie\\'s parents in Petito\\'s van, North Port Police Chief Todd Garrison told reporters in a news conference Thursday afternoon. They intended to drive west, visiting state and national parks along the way, Garrison said. \"Two people went on a trip. One person returned,\" he said. \"And that person that returned isn\\'t providing us any information.\" Petito\\'s family said she maintained regular contact with them throughout the journey, and she and Laundrie documented their travels on Instagram and YouTube. Posts show them at the Mystic Hot Springs in Utah on July 26 and on a large rock structure at Arches National Park in Grand County, Utah, on Aug. 12, the same day police in Moab, Utah, responded to the incident involving an altercation between the couple. Communication from Petito \"abruptly stopped\" toward the end of August, Garrison said, adding that investigators have not yet pieced together a complete timeline of Petito and Laundrie\\'s travels. Petito was last seen leaving a hotel in Utah with Laundrie on Aug. 24. The next day, she spoke to her mother, Nichole Schmidt, informing her that their next stops would be Grand Teton and Yellowstone, Schmidt told ABC News earlier this week. \"She sounded good and excited to continue her trip and excited to start her YouTube channel,\" Schmidt said in tears. \"She seemed OK.\" Schmidt received two text messages from Petito\\'s phone since Aug. 25, but there were no photos or details from the trip, so it is unclear whether Petito actually sent those texts, Schmidt said. Laundrie returned to Florida with Petito\\'s van on Sept. 1, police said. Petito\\'s family reported her missing on Saturday after they hadn\\'t heard from her in more than two weeks. Laundrie, named a person of interest in the case on Wednesday, has not made himself available to speak with investigators, despite numerous pleas from the police department and Petito\\'s parents, authorities said. The latest statement from the attorney representing the Laundrie family, Steven P. Bertolino, said he\\'s advised Laundrie not to speak with authorities. \"Many people are wondering why Mr. Laundrie would not make a statement or speak with law enforcement in the face of Ms. Petito\\'s absence,\" the statement read. \"In my experience, intimate partners are often the first person law enforcement focuses their attention on in cases like this, and the warning that \\'any statement will be used against you\\' is true, regardless of whether my client had anything to do with Ms. Petito\\'s disappearance. As such, on the advice of counsel, Mr. Laundrie is not speaking on this matter.\" The statement continued: \"I have been informed that the North Port, Florida, police have named Brian Laundrie as a \\'person of interest\\' in this matter. This formality has not really changed the circumstances of Mr. Laundrie being the focus and attention of law enforcement and Mr. Laundrie will continue to remain silent on the advice of counsel.\" While police are still treating Petito\\'s disappearance as a missing persons case, Garrison acknowledged that investigators have grown weary of Laundrie\\'s refusal to speak to them, even if he is \"exercising his constitutional rights\" to remain silent. \"We share that frustration with the world,\" Garrison added. During the press conference, Petito\\'s father, Joseph Petito, made an emotional plea to Laundrie, his family and the public to help find his daughter. \"I\\'m asking for help from everyone here,\" he said. \"I\\'m asking for help from everyone at home. I\\'m asking for help from the parents of Brian. \"There is nothing else that matters to me now. This girl right here. This is what matters.\" Laundrie\\'s sister, Cassie Laundrie, described Petito as \"like a sister,\" calling any alleged involvement by her brother \"just a big misunderstanding.\" \"Obviously me and my family want Gabby to be found safe,\" Cassie Laundrie told ABC News on Thursday. \"She\\'s like a sister and my children love her, and all I want is for her to come home safe and found, and this to be just a big misunderstanding.\" ABC News\\' Will Gretsky and Bonnie Mclean contributed to this report.\\nFLAGSTAFF, Ariz. -- Crews searching for a missing man at Grand Canyon National Park made an unexpected discovery this summer. They found the remains of another person, believed to be Scott Walsh, who was last seen stepping off a shuttle bus at the park\\'s South Rim in 2015. The clothing had blended in with the surroundings, and the body was positioned in a way that made it almost undetectable, said park spokeswoman Joelle Baird. \"It happens every once in a while here during searches that we end up finding people we weren\\'t expecting,\" she said Wednesday. Crews had been looking for Gabor Berczi-Tomscanyi, a Hungarian national who lived in Hong Kong. He was reported missing to police in Las Vegas in late July while traveling in the U.S. Southwest. The car he was driving was located in a Grand Canyon parking lot in mid-August and his body was found a few days later -- about 430 feet (131 meters) below the canyon\\'s rim at Yavapai Point. Authorities determined Berczi-Tomscanyi died from a traumatic fall but are still investigating what led up to it. The other body was spotted during an aerial search for Berczi-Tomscanyi. It was found about 600 feet (182 meters) below the Pipe Creek overlook and about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from where Walsh\\'s day pack was found in 2015, Baird said. \"The fact that he was found was just coincidental,\" she said. \"We weren\\'t necessarily looking for him, and he wasn\\'t a person that was really on our radar.\" Walsh wasn\\'t reported to the park as missing in 2015. His last known residence was in Ecuador. Park officials believe it\\'s him because the day pack had prescriptions with his name on them, and a jacket found with the remains had a driver\\'s license issued to Walsh out of Brooklyn, New York, Baird said. He was 56 years old. The park hasn\\'t been able to locate any immediate family but has talked with friends of Walsh, Baird said. The Coconino County medical examiner\\'s office is working to confirm the identity of the skeletal remains. County spokeswoman Trish Lees said that might require DNA testing. Unintentional finds don\\'t happen often at Grand Canyon National Park, which covers 1,904 square miles (4,931 square kilometers) and is bigger than the state of Rhode Island. Eight people are still listed as missing from the Grand Canyon or last seen there over the past 10 years, Baird said. Rangers doing scheduled training have found the remains of others months and years after they were reported missing. Sometimes, rafters on the Colorado River that flows through the Grand Canyon find them. In December 2017, rafters on a day hike found the remains of a California man who was last seen on a trail in June of that year. In 2015, a group of rafters in search of old mining equipment on a hike in the canyon came across the wreckage of a small aircraft with human bones scattered nearby. Investigators had long suspected the homebuilt plane was piloted by Joseph Radford of Glendale, Arizona, and crashed in the canyon in March 2011, likely on purpose, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report. But until the rafters\\' discovery, there were no visual signs of a crash site.\\nIt is expected to be the farthest any civilian has traveled from Earth. The first all-civilian flight to Earth\\'s orbit successfully launched Wednesday. The Falcon 9 rocket took off as scheduled at the start of the five-hour window for launch at 8:02 p.m. ET. It reached orbit about 12 minutes later. The crew said goodbye to their families, suited up and were driven in Teslas to Kennedy Space Center\\'s historic pad 39A Wednesday afternoon. SpaceX\\'s Inspiration4 mission is the third recent billionaire-backed space launch, but it\\'s gone where neither Richard Branson nor Jeff Bezos could -- into orbit. SpaceX tweeted at just before 11 p.m. that the crew had reached an orbit of 535 km, or about 363 miles, the farthest any civilian has traveled from Earth. That is even further than the International Space Station, which orbits at 240 miles. Commanding the mission is 38-year-old billionaire Jared Isaacman, an experienced pilot. He founded a payment process company called Shift4 Payments and purchased all four seats on the flight for an estimated $220 million. Isaacman wants this launch to benefit St. Jude Children\\'s Research Hospital. He has already donated $100 million to the cause. One seat was reserved for 29-year-old St. Jude ambassador Hayley Arceneaux. Arceneaux is a bone cancer survivor and will be the youngest American to go to space as well as the first pediatric cancer survivor. The third occupant will be Dr. Sian Proctor, 51, who said she has dreamed of going to space since she was a child. She burst into tears when she heard she was chosen as a member of the Inspiration4 mission. She will become the fourth Black female American astronaut to travel into space. The final crew member is Chris Sembroski, 41, an Iraq War veteran and engineer with Lockheed Martin, who won the final seat through a lottery that required a St. Jude donation to enter. The four will orbit the Earth for three days with no set destination. They said they will conduct some science experiments while on board and auction off items in space for St. Jude. There is always risk launching into space and coming home. While these passengers have been trained by SpaceX, they are not professional astronauts. The SpaceX Crew Dragon will also be tested for the first time at this distance. They cannot go much longer than three days without running low on fuel, food and water. And while past missions could make changes on the return because of bad weather on Earth due to astronauts on board, this ship wont have quite as much flexibility. After three days of orbiting Earth, they will prepare to splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida late Saturday or early Sunday.\\nOpposition from some leading moderate Democrats over a $3.5 trillion budget proposal championed by the party\\'s most liberal, progressive wing has left the party grappling with deeper ideological questions WASHINGTON -- One side is energized by the prospect of the greatest expansion of government support since the New Deal nearly a century ago. The other is fearful about dramatically expanding Washington\\'s reach at an enormous cost. They\\'re all Democrats. Yet each side is taking vastly different approaches to guiding the massive $3.5 trillion spending bill through Congress. The party is again confronting the competing political priorities between its progressive and moderate wings. The House version of the bill that was drafted this week ushered in a new phase of the debate that could test whether Democrats can match their bold campaign rhetoric on everything from income inequality to climate change with actual legislation. Any stumble may have serious consequences for the party\\'s prospects during next year\\'s midterms, when it will try to prevent Republicans from retaking Congress. The finished product could alienate centrists who say it goes too far, or frustrate those on the left who argue it\\'s too timid at a moment of great consequence. \"This is critically important for Democrats and for their message in next years election,\" said former New York congressman Joe Crowley, a veteran Democrat who was upset in the 2018 primary by progressive star, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \"Were going to blink and were going to be in 2022.\" Crowley said bills proposing trillions of dollars in spending were \"simply something I never had to deal with in my 20 years\" in office. \"These are enormous figures by any standard,\" he said. But, Crowley added, no matter the final price tag, \"Lets not lose sight of the fact that this will be transformational regardless.\" With Republicans universally opposed to the bill, Democratic leaders have a narrow path as they navigate an evenly divided Senate and thin House majority. Many Democrats agree on the goals included in the legislation, such as providing universal pre-kindergarten and tuition-free community college while increasing federal funding for child care, paid family leave and combating climate change. The party also is aiming to expand health care coverage through Medicare and create pathways to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally. But there are differences over how much such a measure should cost and how it should be paid for. Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who met privately with President Joe Biden on Wednesday, have balked at the $3.5 trillion price tag. House Democrats, meanwhile, have proposed a 26.5% top corporate tax rate to help cover the cost. That\\'s less than Biden\\'s 28% target. But Manchin has pushed for an even lower corporate rate of 25%. There are also divides over how to impose levies on top earners. Biden has advocated restoring the top tax rate on capital gains to 39.6%. House Democrats, however, would tax such income, which is often generated by the wealthy, at 25%. They would also impose a 3% surcharge on individual income above $5 million. Biden further supports higher taxes for those earning at least $400,000 annually, even as some progressives would like to see a lower threshold for higher taxes to kick in. \"Were not going to raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000. Thats a lot of money,\" the president said Thursday. \"Some of my liberal friends are saying it should be lower than that.\" Biden discussed the matter Thursday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the White House said they agreed \"it is only fair\" that the spending bill is paid for \"by repealing the Trump tax giveaways to the wealthiest Americans and big corporations.\" Differences over tax thresholds are technical, but they represent a desire among many House Democratic leaders to protect their most vulnerable members in moderate districts from attacks that they support profligate taxes and spending. \"Theres a supposition by our friends on the progressive left that it hardly matters what you do, as long as its big,\" said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Washington think tank. Instead, Democrats are ideologically diverse enough that \"people who run in competitive races simply cant embrace the same kind of ideas that people who run in safe, blue Democratic districts,\" Marshall said. Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of the progressive activist group Our Revolution, countered that \"It would be incredibly problematic for the president to say, \\'Look we won both chambers of Congress. We won the White House. We couldnt deliver better health care, we couldnt deliver transformational change on the climate.\\'\" \"It is not going to be explainable to the American people,\" Geevarghese said, \"and I think therell be consequences as a result.\" Democrats have been here before. The progressive versus moderate divide dominated the early stages of the party\\'s 2020 presidential primary with Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders serving as the most prominent representatives of each end of the spectrum. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, scored early victories. But the party ultimately coalesced around Biden, in part because of an urgent desire to unify behind a candidate who could have the broadest appeal and defeat then-President Donald Trump. Biden has since largely kept the party unified by adopting many top progressive priorities, such as spearheading a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that passed in March and supporting a now-stalled proposal to raise the national minimum wage to $15 per hour. He has resisted, however, some of the biggest progressive goals, including the universal health care proposal known as Medicare for All. But it\\'s unclear whether that equilibrium can be maintained. Already, Our Revolution and other progressive activists have staged protests outside the offices of moderates including Manchin. They\\'ve begun referring to themselves as the \"tea party of the left\" combatting \"obstructionist corporate Democrats.\" Manchin is so far unmoved. \"Ive been very clear and very open\" about the need to reduce the budget bill\\'s price tag, he said. In the House, meanwhile, Democratic Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy, head of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, opposed parts of the spending package in committee, arguing that her partys effort to muscle it through was too rushed. Progressives, though, have responded by playing their own legislative hardball. Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, co-chairwoman of House Progressive Caucus, said the group remains unified behind a vow not to support a separate bill that many moderate Democrats are more excited about -- a $1 trillion, bipartisan public works measure -- until the spending bill advances. \"Joe Manchin has power, of course. We need his vote. But so do, really, every single one of us, because in the House, (Democrats) have a margin of three votes,\" Jayapal said on a conference call with progressive activists. \"Everyones a Joe Manchin here.\" Sanders, who spearheaded the proposal as head of the Senate Budget Committee after some progressives pushed for spending plans worth as much as $6 trillion, says the current price tag is compromise enough and has vowed not to accept further cuts. He says tax increases on the rich can resonate with working class voters from both parties. Marshall said many voters in battleground House districts do indeed applaud higher levies for the wealthy as \"tax fairness,\" but that support wanes if additional spending focuses more on social programs than economic stimulus. \"It has to be tied to a plan to create good jobs, spur innovation and growth,\" said Marshall, who added that many in swing districts have also expressed concerns about running up federal debts and contributing to rising inflation. Still, he said, it would be even more costly for Democrats if the squabbles over the budget proposal\\'s final price tag drag on. \"I think Democrats will find a way to compose their differences simply because they cant afford to have this president fail,\" Marshall said. \"The margins are just too narrow.\"\\nA man from northwestern England was spared jail time after he pleaded guilty to posting racist abuse on social media after three Black players on the England soccer team missed penalty shots during the final of the European Championship in July LONDON -- A man from northwestern England was spared jail time Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to posting racist abuse on social media after three Black players on the England soccer team missed penalty shots during the final of the European Championship in July. The Crown Prosecution Service said Scott McCluskey, 43, of Cheshire posted the comments about Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka after England lost to Italy in a penalty shootout. McCluskey told police he smoked marijuana on the night of the final and posted the comments to make people laugh. He said he didnt realize his comments would be considered racist, and he deleted them after seeing the response from other social media users. McCluskey pleaded guilty at Warrington Magistrates Court. District Judge Nicholas Sanders sentenced him to 14 weeks in prison but suspended the sentence for 18 months. McCluskey will also be subject to an electronically monitored curfew on Saturdays and Sundays for 40 weeks. \"Hate crimes such as these have a massive impact on players and their mental health,\\'\\' Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Elizabeth Jenkins said. \"The (Crown Prosecution Service) takes this kind of offending very seriously and this case shows that where offensive content is reported to the police we can successfully bring offenders to justice.\" At least 11 people have been arrested in connection with widespread racist abuse directed at the three players after the final, according to the U.K. Football Policing Unit.\\nThe indictment claims that Chauvin deprived the teenager of his civil rights. Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murder in George Floyd\\'s death, pleaded not guilty Thursday for allegedly violating the civil rights of a 14-year-old in 2017. This indictment alleges that Chauvin deprived the teenager of his right to be free of unreasonable force. The indictment claims that Chauvin held the teen by his throat, hit him on the head with a flashlight and then kneeled on his neck and upper back as the teen was handcuffed and no longer resisting. The restraint was similar to the one he used on Floyd and resulted in bodily injury for the teen, according to the indictment. This teenager, like Floyd, is Black. At least 18 complaints had been filed against Chauvin during his 19-year tenure with the Minneapolis police department, according to department records. Floyd was killed in May 2020 after he was placed under arrest on the suspicion that he was using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a convenience store. In the Floyd murder trial, prosecutors presented evidence of Chauvin\\'s history of restraining people by kneeling on their neck or upper back -- highlighting eight different incidences to the judge. In Floyd\\'s death, Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd\\'s neck for more than nine minutes. He was sentenced to 22 and-a-half-years in prison. Judge Peter Cahill rejected Chauvin\\'s request for a new trial in June. Chauvin and his fellow former officers Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao have also been charged with violating Floyds constitutional rights in ways that \"resulted in bodily injury to, and the death of, George Floyd,\" according to the federal grand jury indictment. They all pleaded not guilty. Lane, Kueng and Thao also face a state trial on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. They have also entered not guilty pleas on these charges.\\nHe would also have to forfeit more than $3 million. Rhode Island tennis legend Gordon Ernst, who formerly coached at Georgetown, has agreed to plead guilty in connection with his role in the college admissions cheating scheme that embroiled actress Lori Loughlin and other high-profile people, according to a court document filed Wednesday. Ernst has been charged with allegedly taking nearly $3 million in bribes to pass off certain high school students as Georgetown tennis recruits. He has agreed to plead guilty to five separate counts, including conspiracy, federal programs bribery and filing false tax returns, according to the documents. \"Defendant expressly and unequivocally admits that he committed the crimes charged in Counts Four through Seven and Twenty-One of the Second Superseding Indictment, did so knowingly, intentionally and willfully, and is in fact guilty of those offenses,\" the document said. In exchange for Ernsts plea federal prosecutors in Boston have agreed to recommend a sentencing of no more than four years in prison followed by two years of supervised release. He would also have to forfeit more than $3 million. Ernst coached at Georgetown for 12 years. In that time prosecutors have alleged he accepted bribes to get at least a dozen applicants into Georgetown as tennis recruits even though some of them did not play competitive tennis. Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli had paid $500,000 to scheme mastermind Rick Singer to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as rowing team recruits, even though their daughers weren\\'t competitive athletes. The parents were among 50 suspects charged in the investigation dubbed Varsity Blues, which found wealthy parents who cheated college applications and entrance exams to get their children into elite schools. In some cases, parents bribed coaches who falsified students\\' athletics histories, including an instance where a real athlete\\'s photo was manipulated to look like one of the students, prosecutors said. The \"Full House\" actress was sentenced to serve two months in prison, pay a $150,000 fine and two years of supervised release with 100 hours of community service, while her husband, a fashion designer, was sentenced to serve five months in prison, a $250,000 fine and two years of supervised release with 250 hours of community service, according to the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office in the District of Massachusetts. Loughlin was released from prison in December 2020. Giannulli was released in April.\\nA white catfish caught in Connecticut last month has smashed a state record and could also be a world record for the species A white catfish caught in Connecticut last month has smashed a state record and could also be a world record for the species -- though the evidence has been eaten. Ben Tomkunas, 25, caught the 21.3-pound (9.66-kilogram) fish late at night in Coventry on Aug. 21. It was longer than 3 feet (about a meter). Connecticut Fish and Wildlife confirmed in a Facebook post that the catch was a white catfish and that it easily broke the previous state record for the species of 12.7 pounds (5.76 kilograms). \"We were just sitting back and drinking a couple of beers and next thing you know, my reel just starts screaming like I had a 30-pound striper on there,\" Tomkunas, of Coventry, told the Hartford Courant. Tomkunas\\' friend, Chris Braga, had a digital scale and took a photo of the fish coming in at the record-breaking weight. The International Game Fish Association has recorded the world record for a white catfish catch to be 19.3 pounds (8.75 kilograms) for a fish caught in 2005 in California. White catfish are one of several species of catfish in Connecticut, and officials said they scrutinized this catch to confirm it was not a channel catfish, which are generally larger. Other species of catfish, like blue catfish or catfish found in Asia, can dwarf the white catfish. Tomkunas said he intends to submit a claim to the association to secure the new world record. But he also told the newspaper that he gave the fish to his grandfather the next morning. \"It kind of got eaten,\" he said.\\nDulce Maria Alavez disappeared on Sept. 16, 2019, in Bridgeton, New Jersey. Thursday marks two years since 5-year-old Dulce Maria Alavez mysteriously vanished at a New Jersey park. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has worked with investigators to create these age-progression images showing what Dulce may look like today as a 7-year-old. \"Law enforcement continues to pursue all leads\" to find Dulce, Cumberland County Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McRae and Bridgeton Police Chief Michael Gaimari said in a joint statement Wednesday. Authorities -- including state, local and federal -- are working \"to determine those who are responsible\" for her disappearance, the statement said. Dulce was last seen on Sept. 16, 2019, while playing with her 3-year-old brother at the Bridgeton City Park behind Bridgeton High School. Her mother, Noema Alavez Perez, was sitting in her car 30 yards away helping Dulce\\'s 8-year-old sister with homework. \"She was a sweet girl. Nice, loving,\" Perez told ABC News this year. \"She likes to pretend that she was always a princess. She likes to be around like smaller kids. She always like to give hugs and kisses.\" Police and prosecutors said Wednesday there\\'s no evidence of the little girl\\'s death and they \"hold out hope that Dulce is alive.\"\\nJohn Getreu, found guilty in Taylor case, goes to trial for Perlov case in 2022. On March 25, 1974, truck driver Ernesto Evangelo spotted something unusual on his morning milk delivery route near the Stanford Dish, a massive radio antenna close to the Stanford University campus. He pulled over and discovered the lifeless body of a woman in a shallow ditch. It was Janet Taylor, a 21-year-old college sophomore and the daughter of legendary Stanford athletic director, Chuck Taylor. She had been beaten, strangled and left on the side of the road, according to authorities. Her feet were bare and dry despite the wet ground beneath her. Taylor, a student at nearby Canada College, was last seen by her best friend Debbie Adams on the Stanford campus the night before. Her car was in the shop, so Taylor went home on foot, according to Adams\\' testimony. She was anxious to get there to feed her puppy, Adams said, so she resolved to hitchhike. Neither Taylor nor her friend feared for her safety, according to Adams, but that was starting to change. As female empowerment was on the rise, young women hitchhiking alone in the 1970s was a normal occurrence, especially in idyllic Northern California. But just a year earlier, on Feb. 13, 1973, Stanford honors graduate Leslie Perlov, 21, called her mother from the law library to tell her she was driving home, which was a short jaunt from the Stanford campus. She never made it. The next day, search parties found Perlov\\'s body near her abandoned car, about a mile from where Taylors body would be found the following year. Similar to Taylor, Perlov also appeared to have been viciously assaulted and strangled. Her body bore telltale signs of a prolonged brutal torture, according to Santa Clara County coroner Dr. Richard Mason. Perlov had been beaten so badly both her eyes were swollen shut, her nose broken and her underwear and stockings had been shoved down her throat. Despite similarities between the two killings, investigators at the time could not link the crimes. Without credible leads, the university community was steeped in the fear that a serial killer was roaming free and actively stalking young women. As years passed, then decades, both cases went cold. The mystery became known as \"the Stanford murders.\" For nearly 50 years, the families of Leslie Perlov and Janet Taylor waited for justice, until now. Watch the full story on \"20/20\" FRIDAY at 9 p.m. ET on ABC On Tuesday, after a little more than an hour of deliberation, a San Mateo County, California, jury found 77-year-old John Arthur Getreu, a former Stanford employee, guilty of first-degree murder and infliction of great bodily harm in Taylor\\'s death. Getreu is expected to be sentenced on Nov. 3 and could face 25 years to life in prison. His defense attorney John Halley had no comment for this report. Advancements in DNA technology played a critical role in Getreu\\'s conviction for Taylors murder and renews the possibility of justice for Perlov\\'s family. Getreu is scheduled to stand trial for Perlov\\'s death in neighboring county Santa Clara next year. As he did in the Taylor case, Getreu has pleaded not guilty in the Perlov case. But with Getreu in ill health and the COVID-19 pandemic backlog at court, a trial may never happen. \"This is not the end,\" Perlov\\'s sister Diane Perlov said. \"We are moving forward. I want a trial for my sisters case. I dont want any deals. There were some really horrible photographs of what Getreu did to Janet and what he did to Leslie and I want everyone to see them so they understand what a dangerous person he is.\" DNA reveals prime suspect The Perlov case was reexamined in 2016, and newly tested forensic evidence from Perlovs fingernails led to Getreus arrest in November 2018. Cold case detective Sgt. Noe Cortez was the one to have the evidence tested. \"It was a brutal crime... I believe she fought for her life. And part of that was scratching, biting whatever she had to do to survive,\" Cortez said. \"She wanted to live.\" Intrigued by the popular rise of ancestry websites and the potential for discovery of incriminating genetic material, Cortez reviewed the case files and discovered that Perlovs struggle in the last moments of her life yielded DNA from each of her 10 fingernails. Cortezs superior, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith, had made solving the Stanford murders a priority when she was elected Californias first female sheriff in 1996. \"We may not have been able to get them way back when, when we didn\\'t have DNA, but we can do it now. I believe in getting justice no matter how long it takes,\" Smith said. Cortez sent the nail clippings to a private lab. After several months, forensic scientists were able to create a genetic profile for her killer based on the abundance of DNA material. \"Parabon NanoLabs was able to develop a person of interest who they named as John Getreu,\" said Cortez. Authorities say the match Parabon Labs identified had a 1 in 65 septillion odds of being inaccurate. Cortez learned that Getreu was a former Stanford University technician with a dark history of rape and murder, who still lived in the Bay Area. A sting operation was conducted to collect Getreus DNA from a discarded cup. Cortez and his partner followed Getreu and his current wife, who is also a Stanford graduate, to a coffee shop. Authorities say the DNA from that cup was an identical match for the Perlov case and for DNA collected from Taylor\\'s green corduroy pants by San Mateo criminologist Alice Hilker. Getreus history of violence Evan Williams, a retired pastor now living in Tennessee, said he contacted the FBI about Getreu years before his 2018 arrest. Getreu had been convicted of murdering Williams sister in Germany, but moved back to the United States afterwards, and Williams thought he would kill again. \"I\\'m calling to let you know about a man in California who has committed murder that you probably have no idea about. And the reason I know about this man is he killed my sister in 1963,\" Williams remembered telling them. Getreu was 18 when he was convicted of raping and murdering 15-year-old Margaret Williams after offering to walk her home from a dance on a military base in Bad Kreuznach, Germany. Margaret was the youngest daughter of the U.S. Army Chaplain and Evan Williams older sister and best friend. \"My sister Margaret, as a young child, brought a lot of joy to our family. She was a very caring kind of person. And when my sister died, some of the joy of the family was stolen,\" Williams said. One night, following an afterschool gathering that ended at 10:30 p.m., Williams parents were expecting their daughter home by 11 p.m. \"In something my father wrote, he was talking about how it started raining. So he drove to the youth activities building and he found out she had left five minutes before he got there,\" Williams said. \"When she didn\\'t arrive home, he hoped that she had just stopped because of the rain and then would be coming along soon. But then when she did not arrive by midnight, they called authorities and said, our daughter always shows up for curfew and she\\'s not home. Her body was found, I think at 1:11 a.m.\" Evan Williams other sister Marianne Stowers said the whole family was incredibly shaken by the violent loss. \"My mother never wanted to see my sisters dead body at all. So we had a closed casket,\" Stowers said. \"For a real long time after that, I still couldnt believe my sister was dead. I was looking for her everywhere I went. I expected to see her.\" Getreu was convicted in German courts as a juvenile in 1964. \"That meant that he would end up with a shorter sentence and he would also be in juvenile detention,\" Evan Williams said. The maximum sentence at the time for a juvenile was 10 years for homicide. Getreu only served six years and was released on March 7, 1969. The country ordered him to leave Germany within 24 hours of his release. \"They released him one day and he was on a plane the next day to the United States,\" Evan Williams said. \"It\\'s kind of like Germany going, \\'Okay. It\\'s out of our hands.\" The thought of Getreu living freely began to really \"nag him,\" Williams said. He started to do some research online. \"I was able to look up his name, I knew his age, and I found that he was a resident in California. That got my attention and made me think he could potentially be the Golden State Killer,\" Williams said. The so-called \"Golden State Killer\" was Joseph DeAngelo, who was a police officer from 1973 to 1979. He terrorized several areas of California around the same time Perlov and Taylor were killed, committing multiple murders and rapes in the 1970s and \\'80s. That case also remained unsolved until DNA evidence linked DeAngelo to several of those crimes and he was arrested in 2018. In June 2020, DeAngelo pleaded guilty to 13 counts of first-degree murder as part of a plea deal, which also required him to admit to multiple uncharged acts, including rapes. Even still, Williams wondered if Getreu had gone on to commit other violent crimes over the years. \"I thought because of the particulars of what had happened with my sister, that he would commit more violent crimes,\" he said. The stepfather In 1970, less than a year after his release from prison in Germany, Getreu had a job at a California hospital. He married one of his coworkers, Susan, a single mother with a daughter named Cathi. Susan and John Getreu were married for eight years and lived on and off in Palo Alto near the Stanford campus. John Getreu was a Boy Scout leader who appeared to everyone else to be a loving husband and stepfather, but Cathi, now 58, says she knew her stepfather to be a monster. She claims Getreu molested her from when she was 6 years old until she was 14. \"Basically, [he] makes me touch him and tells me that if I tell anyone he will hurt my mother,\" she said. \"And I believed every word he said because he made it very clear to me he had that power.\" Cathi said she never told anyone because she was afraid of what Getreu might do. \"The only thing that was going to save me from him was his death,\" she said. \"And that was the only way I ever thought that it would stop.\" 0:55 The marriage came to an abrupt end in 1977 after Susan said she caught him molesting her daughter. \"The day my mom walked in on John Getreu performing oral on me, probably the most uncomfortable, horrible experience of my entire life but at the same time was the best day of my life because finally my mom knew what was happening and she would stop it,\" Cathi said. \"I didn\\'t know what to do,\" Susan added. \"I was beside myself, and to just think that somebody would do this to a child, just appalled me.\" Susan never filed charges against her ex-husband and John Getreu has not been charged in relation to Cathi though both Susan and Cathi testified against him at trial last week. When asked if John Getreu denied these physical and sexual abuse claims, his defense attorney had no comment. John Getreus new family In October 1978, just months after Susan divorced him, John Getreu married his second wife, Lynda Caputo, who died in 2002. They had two children including a son, Aaron Getreu, who remembers him as a \"loving father.\" \"[There was] never any indication he could have done anything like what he\\'s being accused of,\" Aaron Getreu said. In the first public remarks since his fathers arrest in 2018, John Getreus only son said the man described by prosecutors at Getreus murder trial as a serial rapist and killer is not the man he knows. He said he knew his father as the baseball and soccer coach, someone who taught him to treat women with respect. \"I grew up in a loving household,\" Aaron Getreu said. \"He was a big part of our lives.\" 0:59 Aaron Getreu said he and his wife were shocked when they received the call in November 2018 that his father had been arrested for murder. \"At first I thought this must be some kind of joke,\" he said. \"It was very shocking because thats not my dad. It was like your whole world stopped.\" What\\'s next for John Getreu? With Getreus trial for Taylors murder behind them, Leslie Perlovs younger sister Diane Perlov is undeterred in her quest for justice. She is looking ahead to when Getreu goes on trial for her sisters murder next year. Leslie Perlov, an academic standout, was headed to University of Pennsylvania Law School when she was found dead in 1973. She was killed just months after the family lost their father to cancer. \"[This week] was justice for Janet, Leslie, Diane and Margaret,\" Perlov said. \"While these promising lives are gone forever, thanks to the dogged work of detectives and the advances in forensic science, I have hope that future lives will be saved and other predators held accountable\" Aaron Getreu said he is now on a crusade to find out if his father could be connected to other crimes, trying to make something good happen out of all this \"evil.\" He reached out to Evan Williams and over the course of the two years they have developed a close bond. After Williams testified at John Getreus trial, Aaron Getreu hugged him. \"Welcome to the club, Aaron,\" Williams told him. \"Its a small club and no one ever wants to be a part of it but we are all victims of John Getreu.\" Aaron Getreu said he has refused to speak to his father since his 2018 arrest, but urged him to come forward and reveal if he has committed more crimes. \"[My dad] needs to come out and tell the truth,\" Aaron Getreu said. \"DNA does not lie.\" Grace Kahng is an investigative journalist, Emmy Award-winning documentary filmmaker and director of \"The Stanford Murders.\" Learn more at stanfordmurders.com.\\nA lawyer whose firm represented Hillary Clinton\\'s campaign during the 2016 presidential election was indicted Thursday by special counsel John Durham on a single charge of making a false statement to the FBI. Michael Sussmann, an attorney for the Perkins Coie law firm who previously represented the Democratic National Committee following the hacking of its servers by Russia during the 2016 campaign, is accused of lying \"about the capacity in which he was providing allegations to the FBI\" when he met with a top lawyer from the bureau in September 2016 and provided him information about potential ties between a Russian bank and computer servers in the Trump Organization. \"Specifically, SUSSMANN state falsely that he was not doing his work on the aforementioned allegations \"for any client,\" which led the FBI General Counsel (James A. Baker) to understand that SUSSMANN was acting as a good citizen merely passing along information, not as a paid advocate or political operative,\" prosecutors write in the indictment. They allege instead that Sussmamn intentionally misled the FBI general counsel because he was acting at the time on behalf of an unnamed tech executive, an \"U.S. internet company\" and Hillary Clinton\\'s Presidential Campaign. Prior to his indictment Thursday, Sussmann\\'s attorneys provided a statement to ABC News maintaining his innocence. \"Mr. Sussmann has committed no crime,\" attorneys Sean Berkowitz and Michael Bosworth of the law firm Latham and Watkins said. \"Any prosecution here would be baseless, unprecedented, and an unwarranted deviation from the apolitical and principled way in which the Department of Justice is supposed to do its work.\" \"We are confident that if Mr. Sussmann is charged, he will prevail at trial and vindicate his good name,\" they added. Durham was appointed by former Attorney General William Barr in May 2019 to investigate allegations of misconduct by members of the FBI and the intelligence community in their investigation of potential ties between Russia and former President Donald Trump\\'s 2016 campaign for the presidency. Before his resignation, Barr appointed Durham as special counsel extending his tenure into the Biden administration. While Durham\\'s probe has long since lapsed the total duration of former special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation, prior to Thursday he had yielded only one indictment against a lower-level FBI lawyer who admitted to doctoring an email used in seeking surveillance against a former aide to Trump\\'s campaign. That lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, was sentenced to probation earlier this year. Durham has been tasked with creating a report outlining his findings, though it will be up to Attorney General Merrick Garland to determine whether to make those findings public. Garland has said publicly he has no intention of interfering in Durham\\'s work. The indictment alleges Sussmann began in 2016 working with a U.S. tech executive and other cyber researchers in coordination with the Clinton campaign to assemble \"white papers\" on a potential communications channel between the Trump Organization and Russian-owned Alfa Bank. Sussmann later provided Baker with the documents in a Sept. 19, 2016 meeting where he is alleged to have made the false statement about who he was acting on behalf of at the time. The connections were later examined by the FBI, but not substantiated. In a 2017 deposition with House lawmakers, Sussmann said that he requested the meeting on behalf of a client who was a cybersecurity expert that held data he said showed ties between Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization. According to a source familiar with the matter, his legal team denied in meetings with Durham\\'s team that his meeting with Baker was coordinated or on behalf of members of Clinton\\'s campaign. The meeting between Sussman and Baker occurred more than a month after the FBI\\'s \"Crossfire Hurricane\" investigation -- looking into whether people associated with the Trump campaign were coordinating, wittingly or unwittingly, with the Russian government\\'s efforts to interfere with the 2016 campaign -- was opened on July 31. Days earlier, on July 27, 2016, then-candidate Trump said publicly at a campaign event, \"Russia, if you\\'re listening, I hope you\\'re able to find the more than 30,000 emails that are missing.\" This was an apparent reference to Clinton emails that had been stored on a private server during the time she had served as secretary of state. In the spring of 2016, Russian military intelligence had hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee. Emails and documents stolen by the Russians had already been leaked in June and July of 2016 and Trump continued to encourage more leaks as they continued throughout the campaign. The New York Times, which first reported news of Durham\\'s plans to seek an indictment against Sussmann, also reported that Garland has declined to overrule Durham\\'s decision. Sussmann\\'s legal team has communicated to Durham\\'s team that they believe his case will fall apart under scrutiny for several different reasons, a source said. They have noted that Sussmann\\'s alleged statement to Baker was made nearly five years ago and in a private meeting with no witnesses. And they argue the statements identified by Durham are immaterial in that they likely had no significant impact on any actual investigation being conducted by the FBI at the time. In the indictment, however, prosecutors contend the statement was material \"because, among other reasons, Sussmann\\'s false statement misled the FBI general counsel and other FBI personnel concerning the political nature of his work and deprived the FBI of information that might have permitted it more fully to assess and uncover the origins of the relevant data and technical analysis, including the identities and motivations of Sussmann\\'s clients.\"\\nCongressional Democrats are calling top executives at ExxonMobil and other oil giants to testify about what lawmakers say is a long-running, industry-wide campaign to spread disinformation about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming WASHINGTON -- Congressional Democrats are calling top executives at ExxonMobil and other oil giants to testify at a House hearing as lawmakers investigate what they say is a long-running, industry-wide campaign to spread disinformation about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming. The House Oversight Committee on Thursday requested that executives at ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell testify at a hearing next month, along with leaders of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry\\'s top lobbying group, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"We are deeply concerned that the fossil fuel industry has reaped massive profits for decades while contributing to climate change that is devastating American communities, costing taxpayers billions of dollars and ravaging the natural world,\" Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., wrote in a letter to oil executives. \"We are also concerned that to protect those profits, the industry has reportedly led a coordinated effort to spread disinformation to mislead the public and prevent crucial action to address climate change,\" they wrote. Khanna, chairman of Oversight\\'s environment subcommittee, has been pressing the oil industry for months for documents and other information on its role in stopping climate action. Khanna has been focusing on Exxon after a senior lobbyist for the company was caught in a secret video bragging that Exxon had fought climate science through \"shadow groups\" and had targeted influential senators in an effort to weaken President Joe Bidens climate agenda, including a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a massive $3.5 trillion spending bill currently moving through Congress. Washington-based lobbyist Keith McCoy also dismissed Exxons public expressions of support for a proposed carbon tax on fossil fuel emissions as a \"talking point.\" McCoy\\'s comments were made public in June by the environmental group Greenpeace UK, which secretly recorded McCoy and another lobbyist in Zoom interviews. Darren Woods, Exxons chairman and chief executive, condemned McCoy\\'s statements and said the company stands by its commitment to work on finding solutions to climate change. Woods is among the executives the House panel hopes to question at an Oct. 28 hearing, along with BP America CEO David Lawler, Chevron CEO Michael Wirth and Shell president Gretchen Watkins. The committee also has said it will formally question McCoy about his comments, although timing of that interview has not been set. Maloney and Khanna said in a statement that ExxonMobil and other oil companies \"have worked to prevent serious action on global warming by generating doubt about the documented dangers of fossil fuels and misrepresenting the scale of their efforts to develop alternative energy technologies.\\'\\' They compared the tactics to those deployed by the tobacco industry to resist regulation \"while selling products that kill hundreds of thousands of Americans.\\'\\' The oil industry\\'s \"strategies of obfuscation and distraction span decades and still continue today,\\'\\' Khanna and Maloney said. The five largest publicly traded oil and gas companies reportedly spent at least $1 billion from 2015 to 2018 \"to promote climate disinformation through \\'branding and lobbying,\\' \" the lawmakers wrote. The committee gave oil executives until Sept. 23 to respond and said additional steps, including issuing subpoenas, are possible. A spokesman for Exxon said the company had received the letter and would respond to the committee. He declined further comment. Bethany Aronhalt, a spokeswoman for API, said the group \"welcomes the opportunity to testify again before the House Oversight Committee and advance our priorities of pricing carbon, regulating methane and reliably producing American energy.\" API President Mike Sommers was among those invited to testify next month. Exxon and other oil companies frequently boast about efforts they say they are making to produce clean energy in social media posts accompanied by sleek videos or pictures of wind turbines. \"We power progress together by providing more and cleaner energy solutions for the world,\" says Shells Facebook profile, which is followed by more than 9 million people. ------ Associated Press writer Amanda Seitz in Columbus, Ohio contributed to this story.\\nPolice have named the boyfriend of Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old woman who went missing during a couple\\'s cross-country road trip, a person of interest in her disappearance. Brian Laundrie raised flags among Petito\\'s family after he returned home to their home in North Port, Florida, with Petito\\'s white Ford van -- but Petito was nowhere to be found. The couple embarked on their trip in July from New York, where Petito is originally from, and made stops in Colorado and Utah, her family told ABC News. Her mother, Nichole Schmidt, last heard from her on Aug. 25, when Petito informed Schmidt that they were on their way to Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. Laundrie returned to Florida on Sept. 1, police said. The North Port Police Department in Florida announced Wednesday that Laundrie is now a person of interest in Petito\\'s disappearance. The department has taken a lead in the investigation, since both parties reside there, but investigators \"have no information\" that a crime took place there, police said. Petito\\'s van was recovered from the North Port home where she resided with Laundrie and his parents, but investigators are not ready to release details from the search, North Port Police Public Information Officer Josh Taylor told reporters in a news conference Wednesday. A search warrant for the home has not been issued, Taylor added. Laundrie has not made himself available to be interviewed by investigators, police said. Investigators and Petito\\'s family are pleading with Laundrie to share crucial information that could help locate her. North Port Police Chief Todd Garrison even accused Laundrie of \"hindering this investigation,\" stating that \"the answers will eventually come out.\" \"As a father, I can imagine the pain and suffering Gabby\\'s family is going through,\" Garrison said in a statement. \"We are pleading with anyone, including Brian, to share information with us on her whereabouts in the past few weeks.\" Petito was last seen on Aug. 24 as she and Laundrie checked out of a hotel in Salt Lake City, her family said. Schmidt had received two text messages from Petito since Aug 25, but they did not contain any photos or updates on the couple\\'s plans, so it is not clear whether Petito actually sent those texts. Schmidt also posted her last Instagram post, which was not geotagged, on Aug. 25. Petito seemed \"excited\" the last time Schmidt spoke to her, but she began to worry after she had not heard from her for several days, she said. \"A few days is one thing when youre out camping, but when it starts to become seven, eight, nine, 10 days, thats a problem,\" Schmidt told ABC News. Instagram posts from both Petito and Laundrie show them at the Mystic Hot Springs in Utah on July 26 and on a large rock structure at Arches National Park in Grand County, Utah, on Aug. 12. On Aug. 12, police in Moab, Utah, responded to an \"incident involving Brian Laundrie and Gabrielle Petito,\" but there \"insufficient evidence existed to justify criminal charges,\" Moab, Utah Police Chief Bret Edge said in a statement Tuesday night. Officers responded to a report of a domestic problem after a witness said the couple, involved in an altercation at the Arches National Park, drove off in a white van, according to a police report. When police officers located a van and pulled it over for a traffic stop, the couple admitted to arguing and that Petito had slapped Laundrie, according to the report. The couple also stated to police that Laundrie did not hit Petito. Petito told police that she suffers from severe anxiety and other medical conditions, which were redacted from the police report, and that the arguments had been building for the past few days. Police labeled the incident as a \"mental/emotional break\" rather than a domestic assault, according to the report. On Aug. 19, Petito posted an eight-minute compilation of the couple\\'s adventures so far on her YouTube channel \"Nomadic Statik.\" Her family reported her missing to the Suffolk County Police Department in New York on Saturday. Taylor, of the North Port Police Department, expressed concern that Laundrie had been in Florida for 10 days without saying anything before Petito\\'s family reported her missing. \"We\\'re hopeful to talk to him. He needs to talk to us,\" Taylor said. \"We need to know exactly where he was, where she was, their last locations. And the fact that he was back here for 10 days, you know the family reported her missing 10 days later ...\" While Laundrie has not spoken publicly, his family released a statement Tuesday through their attorney Steven P. Bertolino, describing Petito\\'s disappearance as \"an extremely difficult time\" for both families. \"This is understandably an extremely difficult time for both the Petito family and the Laundrie family,\" the statement read. \"It is our understanding that a search has been organized for Miss Petito in or near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. On behalf of the Laundrie family, it is our hope that the search for Miss Petito is successful and that Miss Petito is re-united with her family. On the advice of counsel, the Laundrie family is remaining in the background at this juncture and will have no further comment.\" Petito\\'s family released a statement Tuesday claiming that \"the one person that can help find Gabby refuses to help,\" adding that they \"beg the Laundrie family to not \\'remain in the background\\' but to help find who Brian referred to as the love of his life.\" \"Brian is refusing to tell Gabbys family where he last saw her,\" the Petito family said. \"Brian is also refusing to explain why he left Gabby all alone and drove her van to Florida. These are critical questions that require immediate answers.\" The FBI and agencies in Utah and New York are also participating in the investigation.

Young, her 2-year-old son, and the 16-year-old son of a friend were driving through West Philadelphia on Oct. 27, 2020, when she came across protesters blocking the street in a standoff with police, who ordered Young to turn back. As she began to turn the car around, Young\\'s attorneys said she paused so she didn\\'t hit protesters running by her car. Young\\'s attorneys said officers swarmed her vehicle and broke her windows with batons and then opened her car door, pulled Young and the 16-year-old from their seats and began to hit them. Young was detained by police, and her 2-year-old son was taken away from her. The teen is not involved in the $2 million settlement. Young also said the National Fraternal Order of Police used a photo of her son after he was taken away from her during the incident and used it on social media to promote pro-police messaging online. National FOP spokesperson Jessica Cahill told the Associated Press that the post was quickly taken down when it learned about the actual story behind the photo. The National Fraternal Order of Police did not immediately respond to ABC News\\' request for comment. \"I will never forget what those officers did to us that night,\" Young said in press conference on Tuesday. \"I hope that the officers responsible will never have the chance to do something like this to another person ever again.\" Young suffered from swelling on her face and body, as well as a swollen trachea, according to her attorneys. The beating was caught on a cellphone camera and went viral online. \"The behavior that occurred during the interaction between Rickia Young, her nephew, her son, and some of the officers on the scene violated the mission of the Philadelphia Police Department,\" Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said in a statement to ABC News. Two officers have been terminated in connection with the incident, according to the office of Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney. There are also 14 members in the department awaiting disciplinary hearings as a result of an internal investigation into the incident. \"The ability for officers and supervisors on the scene to diffuse the situation was abandoned, and instead of fighting crime and the fear of crime, some of the officers on the scene created an environment that terrorized Rickia Young, her family, and other members of the public,\" Outlaw said. Kenney said he hopes the settlement and investigations into the officers actions can bring closure to Young and her family. \"This terrible incident, which should have never happened to anyone, only further strained the relationship between the police department and our communities,\" Kenney said in a statement to ABC News. \"The officers inexcusable actions that evening prompted an immediate and thorough investigation of the incident and for personnel to be disciplined and held accountable for their egregious conduct.\" Mincey is calling on the district attorney to take more action against the officers involved. \"The district attorney Lawrence Krasner needs to file criminal charges against the officers who were involved,\" Mincey said. \"If any citizen did something like this, there would be no question they will be charged with aggravated assault as a felony.\" Krasner has not said whether he will pursue a criminal case against the officers.\\nWere excited to kick off Hispanic Latinx Heritage Month from now through Oct. 15 by celebrating the inspirational stories of our Disney Parks, Experiences and Products Imagineers and cast members. Today, were sharing the story of Liz Diaz, assistant construction manager at Walt Disney Imagineering, who was behind the magic of bringing Remys Ratatouille Adventure to Walt Disney World Resort. Liz was born in Cuba and moved to Venezuela with her family at age 5 before immigrating to the U.S. at age 12. Growing up in the Caribbean and South America where Spanish was her first language, Disney had a big impact on her life. \"I remember watching Disney movies with subtitles and learning the lyrics to the songs, which helped me learn English,\" Liz recalls. \"Growing up, my dream job would have been to be an animator for Disney or Pixar, but my drawing skills were certainly not up to par! Through that dream, I learned about Imagineering.\" During her last semester at Florida International University in Miami where she was pursuing a Masters degree in Architecture, Liz applied to a few internships at Walt Disney Imagineering. While she didnt land her dream internship right away, her persistence paid off in 2014 when she received an opportunity to join Disneys Animal Kingdom expansion team as a Project Management Intern, just a couple months after graduation. Liz on the project site for Remys Ratatouille Adventure at EPCOT with Project Management Executive, Mike Davie. \"The best part about growing my career at Disney has been all of the different opportunities within the company,\" she said. \"I started as a project manager, then moved to construction management, and I could even go back to being an architect, or try something completely different. The possibilities are endless!\" While Liz has many great memories of working on different projects with Walt Disney Imagineering including Satuli Canteen at Pandora - The World of Avatar, her most recent opportunity as the assistant construction manager on Remys Ratatouille Adventure, opening to guests on Oct. 1 at EPCOT, has been her favorite memory so far. Liz enjoying a cast member preview opportunity with her parents and grandma \"All projects are always great in the end, but its the people along the way that make them memorable, which is why Remys is my favorite,\" explained Liz. \"I have countless memories from all of the projects Ive worked on, but there is always one recurring memory in every project that stands out -- the moment you get to share it! Whether its having the first meal at a new restaurant with your family, friends, and project team, or riding a new attraction together for the first time, thats why we do what we do.\" Another proud moment for Liz was when she recently had the opportunity to lead a tour of Remys Ratatouille Adventure for Puerto Rican singer and songwriter, Luis Fonsi, best known for his worldwide hit song \"Despacito,\" and his family. Liz giving a tour of Remys Ratatouille Adventure to Luis Fonsi and his family. \"Leading a tour for Luis Fonsi in Spanish was both nerve-wracking and incredibly exciting,\" said Liz. \"I was definitely a little star struck, but I was determined to present the new attraction on behalf of Walt Disney Imagineering in a way that would do the project justice, and get them to love it as much as we do.\" As we honor Hispanic Latinx Heritage Month, Liz shares the importance of representation and how her Cuban heritage plays a unique perspective in her role as a Disney Imagineer. \"Our theme parks are part of a global industry. The only way to make a breathtaking product or experience that resonates with our international audiences is to understand what makes each culture unique and what their people love and enjoy. And, the only way to do that is to gather diverse teams.\" Liz also shared, \"A lot of our work at Imagineering is based on close coordination and communication. Being able to communicate with some of our construction partners in my native Spanish language goes a long way in our relationship. It helps with understanding, but also to build mutual trust and respect through a commonality of language.\" Inclusion has always been essential to our Disney culture. With the introduction of the key of Inclusion earlier this year, the Construction Management team at Walt Disney Imagineering is making a conscious effort to connect with minority and women owned businesses when opportunities arise. For anyone aspiring to become a Disney Imagineer, Liz shared that \"You have to know yourself to be successful. Ask yourself, \\'what drives you? The rest will come. Also, dont forget to be confident yet humble.\" Stay tuned for more inspiring stories like Lizs as we bring you more stories highlighting the many contributions of our Hispanic and Latinx cast across Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.

Democrat McAuliffe, who served as the commonwealth\\'s top executive between 2014 and 2018, touted his past record throughout the debate, arguing in his closing statement that Virginia needs someone \"who\\'s done this job before to lead us through\" the pandemic, plugging his 20 policy plans. But Republican Youngkin, a former private equity executive, repeatedly took aim at that same record, urging voters to \"embrace someone new\" to politics over the \"old, recycled policies from a tired politician.\" During the hour-long event, the nominees repeatedly clashed, sparring over COVID vaccine mandates, economic policy and abortion rights. But on one critical issue -- the question of whether they would accept the results of the election if they lost, even narrowly -- they were in agreement. \"Absolutely,\" both candidates pledged, each confident they would come out on top. Also asked if he agreed with former President Donald Trump\\'s baseless allegations that Democrats may try to cheat in this contest, Youngkin, whom Trump endorsed, said, \"No ... I think we\\'re gonna have a clean, fair election.\" The debate was held at the Appalachian School of Law in Grundy, Virginia. The tiny town of about 1,000 residents sits in the middle of the southwestern Buchanan County, which borders both West Virginia and Kentucky. The region is a Republican stronghold, but the next and final debate, scheduled for Sept. 28 in Alexandria, will take place in vote-rich and reliably blue Northern Virginia. With only two debates agreed to by both candidates, Virginia voters won\\'t see them face off at all the month before the election. The AARP of Virginia, which has sponsored gubernatorial and Senate debates for the last 15 years, canceled its Oct. 12 debate in the state capital after Youngkin declined to participate. Fighting the coronavirus, recovering from the pandemic Each candidate advocated that Virginians should get vaccinated against the coronavirus, but while McAuliffe favors mandates, Youngkin stressed personal responsibility. \"I have been a strong, strong advocate for everyone to get the vaccine. I do believe that individuals should be allowed to make that decision on their own,\" Youngkin said. \"I think what we need to do right now is make sure that everyone in Virginia understands that getting the vaccine is the most important thing we can do.\" The Republican, who disputed McAuliffe\\'s characterization that he is \"anti-vax,\" also said he does not believe President Joe Biden has the authority to require companies with 100 or more employees to mandate vaccinations, as he did with a new federal rule last week. McAuliffe, who did specifically weigh in on Biden\\'s policy, made clear that when it comes to him and his opponent on this issue, \"I am for requiring ... vaccinations, he\\'s not.\" \"I\\'ve called for employers to mandate their employees. I\\'ve called for everyone who works in a hospital to be vaccinated, call for every individual who works in a long-term care facility or a nursing home. Everybody who works in K-12, everybody who attends higher ed,\" McAuliffe said. \"I have been very strongly on this from day one.\" Pressed on whether he would have Virginia require eligible school children, currently those over the age of 12 get vaccinated, McAuliffe said, \"Absolutely -- you bet I would. I want everybody vaccinated.\" Given the opportunity to ask Youngkin a question, McAuliffe again focused on this issue, asking if his opponent would favor requiring a nurse working with immunocompromised cancer patients be vaccinated. Youngkin didn\\'t sway from his position, saying the \"nurse should fully understand that getting the vaccination is the best way to protect her health and those around her.\" Both candidates are former businessmen, but they argued over their plans to recovery from the pandemic, to rebuild and create jobs. \"What I\\'ll do as governor is build a booming economy as I did before. (I) created a large amount of revenue, I left with a big surplus,\" McAuliffe said, also referencing a Washington Post editorial that said Youngkin\\'s economic plan \"would run our economy into the ditch.\" The former governor claimed, citing \"independent reports,\" that Youngkin\\'s plan would cut $10 billion from education funds, leading to 43,000 less teachers and cutting $50 million from the commonwealth\\'s law enforcement budget. Youngkin, standing at the podium next to him, could be heard saying, \"Not true,\" while he shook his head. \"God made me with a big nose, but Terry McAuliffe has racked up so many Pinocchios I\\'m afraid you can\\'t fit in the building. Everything he\\'s just said is categorically false. The studies he\\'s claiming that had been written weren\\'t even on my plan and if you\\'ve read my plan, Terry, you would know that,\" Youngkin said. \"By the way, if Terry McAuliffe is your next governor ... get your checkbook out, because he\\'s gonna have to raise taxes for you. My plan, in fact, recognizes that our economy stalled under his leadership.\" Abortion Spurred by the Supreme Court declining to block the most restrictive abortion law in Texas earlier this month, abortion was thrust into the forefront of the Virginia gubernatorial campaign, and on Thursday, it was one of the most contentious moments of the night. The Texas law has a unique -- and controversial -- citizen-enforcement method, essentially outlawing abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy, only giving exceptions to when the life of the mother is endangered. Youngkin was asked whether he would enact a law, if passed by the state legislature, that banned abortions after a fetal heartbeat was detected, excluding in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is endangered. Despite the moderator pressing, the Republican nominee would not directly answer, but said he is \"pro-life,\" supports all three of the aforementioned exceptions and believes a \"pain-threshold bill legislation would be appropriate.\" That is understood to be 20 weeks post-fertilization, but the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks reproductive health legislation, calls that an \"unfounded assertion.\" Youngkin cast McAuliffe as \"the most extreme pro-abortion candidate in America today,\" but McAuliffe cast himself as a \"brick wall\" to protecting choice in women\\'s reproductive health. \"I\\'ll say this again to every woman watching tonight. I will protect your rights, I believe a woman ought to make a decision about her own reproductive rights, and I will support those,\" McAuliffe said. \"I am terrified today about what\\'s happened with the Trump Supreme Court. I am terrified today that they will rollback Roe v. Wade, so ... the only thing I would like to see is enshrining Roe v. Wade in the Virginia constitution.\" McAuliffe said he supports \"the laws that we have on the books today,\" which only allows a woman to receive an abortion after the second trimester in select circumstances when three doctors agree the woman\\'s life or health is significantly endangered. However, he was asked about a specific proposed bill that would reduce that to just one doctor\\'s opinion. McAuliffe said in rural areas of the state, there often aren\\'t three doctors. \"That really puts women in rural communities at a real disadvantage. So if they came up with a solution -- and a woman\\'s life has to be in danger, has to be certified -- and if you have a legitimate doctor that says this woman, her life is in danger, of course I would support that,\" he said. \"I\\'ll do anything I can.\"\\nAbout 400 to 450 people were in the protest area Saturday, Capitol Police said. The \"Justice for J6\" rally was billed as a protest for defendants being detained in connection with the January insurrection at the Capitol. At least 610 individuals have been federally charged for their involvement in the Jan. 6 riot at the United States Capitol, according to the Department of Justice. Most of the roughly 60 who remain behind bars are suspects prosecutors and judges have identified as posing a credible and ongoing threat to the public\\'s safety. Many of the same far-right groups and individuals who promoted the original Jan. 6 rally-turned insurrection this time warned supporters to avoid the demonstration at all costs. Former President Donald Trump called it a \"setup\" but also released a statement supporting those charged. With the House and Senate both out, no lawmakers were at the Capitol on Saturday. But preventative security measures were taken, including the reinstallation of temporary fencing around the Capitol complex.\\nA string of bloody killings and mysteries involving a prominent South Carolina family has sent investigators on a wild chase full of twists and turns. At the center of it is Alex Murdaugh, a 53-year-old South Carolina lawyer who comes from a legacy of prominent attorneys in the state where three generations of the family had been state prosecutors in the Hampton County area for more than a century. The saga began when Murdaugh\\'s wife, Margaret \"Maggie\" Murdaugh, 52, and their son Paul, 22, were found fatally shot in June. Since then, there have been curveballs in the investigation including Alex Murdaugh\\'s alleged money misuse that led to the suspension of his law license, and other allegations of an opioid addiction, an assisted-suicide attempt and a $10 million insurance fraud scheme. Here\\'s a timeline of the key events in the Murdaugh murders and scandals: June 7, 2021: Margaret and Paul Murdaugh are found dead Margaret and Paul Murdaugh were found dead on June 7 near dog kennels at the familys home near Islandton, South Carolina, police said. The Colleton County sheriffs department said both victims suffered multiple gunshot wounds. Their bodies were discovered by Alex Murdaugh, police said. He told authorities he had been out at the time of the shooting and found his wife and son dead when he arrived home, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) said in a later news release. At the time Paul Murdaugh was awaiting trial on a charge of allegedly boating under the influence after a crash in February 2019 that killed a 19-year-old woman, Mallory Beach of South Carolina. The wreck led to some questioning whether his familys ties to the legal system in the area affected the investigation, local newspaper The Island Packet reported at the time. Duffie Stone, the 14th circuit solicitor appointed in 2006, the first non-Murdaugh to hold the position since 1920, recused himself from the case because of personal connections. June 17: Alex Murdaugh\\'s brothers speak on \"Good Morning America\" John Marvin Murdaugh and Randolph \"Randy\" Murdaugh IV spoke with \"Good Morning America\" about the deaths of Maggie and Paul, saying they didn\\'t believe their brother was involved in their killings. \"My brother loved Maggie and loved Paul like nothing else on this earth, just like he loves Buster,\" Randy said, naming Alex\\'s other son. \"So there\\'s no possible way he could have anything to do with this, I can assure you.\" June 22: Authorities reopen probe into 2015 death of Stephen Smith SLED announced it reopened an investigation into the death of a man named Stephen Smith, 19, after new evidence was gathered during the course of the investigation into the Murdaugh double homicide. Smith was found dead in the middle of a road in Hampton County in 2015 and investigators believed he was hit by a vehicle but no suspects were ever apprehended, a local ABC affiliate in North Carolina, WTVD, reported. June 25: Murdaugh family announce $100,000 reward for information Alex Murdaugh and his son Buster announced a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of assailants involved in the murders of Maggie and Paul. \"I want to thank everyone for the incredible love and support that we have received over the last few weeks,\" Murdaugh said in a statement at the time. \"Now is the time to bring justice for Maggie and Paul. Buster and I, along with Maggies mother, father and our entire family, ask that anyone with helpful information should immediately call the SLED tip line or Crime Stoppers.\" Sept. 3 : Alex Murdaugh resigns from law firm Murdaugh officially resigned from the law firm Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Eltzroth, & Detrick based in Hampton, South Carolina, on Sept. 3 but publicly announced his resignation days later. Sept. 4: Murdaugh calls 911 saying he was shot A major twist in the case came when Alex Murdaugh called authorities saying he was shot in the head in Hampton County on Sept. 4. A family spokesperson told ABC News at the time that he was changing a tire when a car passed him. The vehicle turned around and \"someone in the car shot him,\" the spokesperson said to ABC News. SLED said in a statement at the time that he was shot on Old Salkehatchie Road near Varnville, South Carolina. He was transported to a hospital in Savannah, Georgia, for \"treatment of a superficial gunshot wound to the head,\" SLED said. The familys spokesperson later offered a clarification regarding the shooting, saying, \"Alex had an entry and exit wound, his skull was fractured and it was not a self-inflicted bullet wound. Alex pulled over after seeing a low-tire indicator light. A male driver in a blue pickup asked him if he had car troubles, as soon as Alex replied, he was shot.\" Sept. 6: Murdaugh announces resignation, enters rehab Alex Murdaugh publicly announced that he resigned from his law firm and will enter rehab. \"The murders of my wife and son have caused an incredibly difficult time in my life. I have made a lot of decisions that I truly regret. Im resigning from my law firm and entering rehab after a long battle that has been exacerbated by these murders. I am immensely sorry to everyone Ive hurt including my family, friends and colleagues. I ask for prayers as I rehabilitate myself and my relationships,\" he said. Sept. 7: Law firm says Murdaugh left due to money misuse Alex Murdaugh\\'s former law firm, Peters Murdaugh Parker Eltzroth & Detrick, released a statement Sept. 7 saying Murdaugh formally resigned Sept. 3 and that \"he is no longer associated with PMPED in any manner.\" \"His resignation came after the discovery by PMPED that Alex misappropriated funds in violation of PMPED standards and policies. A forensic accounting firm will be retained to conduct a thorough investigation.\" The firm said that it contacted law enforcement and the South Carolina Bar. Sept. 8: Brother \"shocked\" by Murdaugh allegations; Alex Murdaughs law license suspended Alex Murdaughs older brother Randy Murdaugh, who is also still employed by the firm, released a statement saying he was \"shocked\" to learn of his brothers \"settling of money,\" as well as \"drug addiction.\" \"I love my law firm family and also love Alex as my brother. While I will support him in his recovery, I do not support, condone, or excuse his conduct in stealing by manipulating his most trusted relationships. I will continue to pursue my clients interests with the highest degree of honesty and integrity, as I always have,\" he said. The South Carolina Supreme Court also issued an order suspending Alex Murdaughs license to practice law in the state. Sept. 13: SLED investigates missing money from law firm SLED confirmed they are the law enforcement agency investigating the missing money from the law firm. Sept. 14: Police charge man in Alex Murdaugh shooting SLED announced the arrest of Curtis Edward Smith, 61, in connection with the shooting incident involving Alex Murdaugh on Sept. 4 in Hampton County. Smith was charged with assisted suicide, assault and battery of a high-aggravated nature, pointing and presenting a firearm, insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit insurance fraud. Sept. 15: Lawyers say Murdaugh set up his own shooting, police open criminal investigation into 2018 death of Gloria Satterfield Alex Murdaugh enlisted Curtis Smith to shoot and kill him while in his mentally ill, drug addicted and grieving state, Murdaugh\\'s attorneys Jim Griffin and Dick Harpootlian said in a statement on Sept. 15, a day after Smith was charged. \"On September 4, it became clear Alex believed that ending his life was his only option. Today, he knows thats not true. For the last 20 years, there have been many people feeding his addiction to opioids. During that time, these individuals took advantage of his addiction and his ability to pay substantial funds for illegal drugs. One of those individuals took advantage of his mental illness and agreed to take Alex\\'s life, by shooting him in the head,\" the statement said. \"Fortunately, Alex was not killed by the gunshot wound. Alex is fully cooperating with SLED in their investigations into his shooting, opioid use and the search to find the person or people responsible for the murder of his wife and son. Alex is not without fault but he is just one of many whose life has been devastated by opioid addiction,\" the lawyers\\' statement continued. Also on Sept. 15, the sons of a former Murdaugh housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield, filed a lawsuit against Alex Murdaugh, Corey Fleming and others for allegedly swindling them out of receiving settlement money. Satterfield reportedly died after a falling accident in the Murdaugh family home in February 2018, the lawsuit states. In the civil lawsuit, Satterfields surviving sons claimed Alex Murdaugh approached them after she died, proposing the sons sue him so they would get a life insurance settlement on their mothers behalf, the complaint states. The court papers said that Murdaugh personally introduced them to fellow attorney Corey Fleming with the recommendation that Fleming should represent them \"in filing legal claims against Murdaugh for the wrongful death of their mother.\" The alleged conspiracy led to a $505,000 settlement, but Satterfields sons claim they havent gotten any of that settlement money, which was agreed upon in December 2018, the lawsuit claimed. SLED then said they were opening the investigation into Satterfield\\'s death at the request of the Hampton County Coroners Office and due to information gathered during the course of other ongoing investigations involving Alex Murdaugh. Sept. 16: Alex Murdaugh surrenders Murdaugh turned himself in at the Hampton County Detention Center Thursday, Sept. 16. He was arrested in connection to the Sept. 4 shooting incident \"in which he conspired with Curtis Edward Smith to assist him in committing suicide for the explicit purpose of allowing a beneficiary to collect life insurance,\" SLED said in a statement. The affidavit said Murdaugh provided a statement to SLED on Sept. 13: \"Admitting to the scheme ... for the purpose of his son collecting a life insurance policy valued at approximately $10 million.\" A day later, Smith admitted to being present during the Murdaugh shooting and disposing the firearm afterward. Murdaugh was charged with insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, along with filing a false police report. The case will be prosecuted by the attorney generals office. \"I can assure you that SLED agents will continue working to bring justice to anyone involved with any criminal act associated with these ongoing investigations,\" said SLED Chief Mark Keel. \"The arrests in this case are only the first step in that process.\" Earlier on Sept. 16, Curtis Edward Smith appeared in front of a Hampton County Judge for a bond hearing on charges where he agreed to a public defender and had his bond set at $55,000 for the attempted assisted suicide of Alex Murdaugh. His next hearing was set for Oct. 25. Sept. 18: $20,000 bond In a bond hearing in Hampton County court on Thursday, Sept. 18. Alex Murdaugh was ordered held on a $20,000 personal recognizance bond. Murdaugh will return to rehab, according to his attorney, and will change to an out-of-state rehab facility afterwards. If he leaves the rehab facility, there will be a bench warrant issued for his arrest, Judge Tonja Alexander said. ABC News\\' Eva Pilgrim, Alexandra Faul and William Gretsky contributed to this report\\nFred Dakota has died at age 84 after creating a milestone for Native American gambling by opening a garage casino in Michigan in the 1980s BARAGA, Mich. -- Fred Dakota, whose garage casino in Michigan\\'s Upper Peninsula in 1983 was a milestone for Native American gambling, has died at age 84. Dakota, a former leader of the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, died Monday at his home in Baraga, according to Reid Funeral Service. The cause was not disclosed. Tribal offices were closed Friday, the day of the funeral, along with Keweenaw Bay Ojibwa Community College. Ojibwa Casino locations in Baraga and Marquette were closed for much of the afternoon. \"It was an honor and a privilege to stand shoulder to shoulder with one of the greatest leaders in Indian country,\" tribal President Warren \"Chris\" Swartz Jr. said. \"Fred impacted not only KBIC, but many tribal communities with his leadership abilities.\" With a single blackjack table, Dakota opened a casino in a two-stall garage in Baraga County on New Year\\'s Eve 1983. A shot of whiskey was 70 cents; better stuff was 20 cents more. \"We gave the government vast tracts of land in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota when we signed that treaty in 1854,\" Dakota told The New York Times in 1984. \"And what did we get in return? We got the government to agree not to kill us. Well, now its time we got something more. Gambling is going to make a lot of Indians rich.\" The garage casino led to construction of a larger casino, but decisions by federal courts shut it down. Dakota said he couldn\\'t afford more appeals. By 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court used a California case to ease restrictions on gambling on tribal land, a turning point for Native American casinos. A federal law a year later allowed states to negotiate compacts with tribes. A jury in 1997 convicted Dakota of accepting $127,000 in bribes from a New Jersey slot machine dealer and evading taxes on the money. He claimed the money was an advance for a telephone lottery game. Dakota was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison.\\nThe number of flags has nearly tripled since the first display in fall 2020. On one small, white rectangle is the name of a 29-year-old engineer, on another the name of a World War II veteran, and on a third, that of a 15-year-old -- just three of more than 600,000 flags on the National Mall reflecting the devastating impact COVID-19 has had on American lives and the country. On the grassy expanse near the Washington Monument, the field of flags is being displayed as a part of a chilling exhibition called \"In America: Remember.\" Each represents a life lost to the pandemic, and each sits amid a sea of symbolic grief. This is the second stunning exhibit based on a project trying to capture, the artist said, the \"human dignity\" behind the mind-numbing numbers. Back in the fall of 2020, the first featured a then-unthinkable 200,000 flags near RFK Stadium in Washington. Since then, the scope of the new project has more than tripled as the death toll fro COVIF-19 continues to rise, on Monday surpassing that of the 1918 influenza pandemic, now topping 675,000 -- or one in every 500 Americans. The exhibit, unveiled Friday, will stay on the National Mall until Oct. 3. Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg, the artist, spoke with ABC News as more and more flags were being placed last week. \"It\\'s really hard to think about the grief that is just embodied by one flag,\" Firstenberg said. \"And when as you walk amongst 660,000, it\\'s unimaginable the pain that people have gone through.\" Visitors can walk among the flags on more than 3 miles of paths to view the exhibit and can also stop at a table and personalize a flag with the name of a loved one lost. Some visitors took to social media to post photos and describe the scene. Many now also carry messages from across the country submitted on the project\\'s website, messages to mothers, fathers, siblings and friends. Firstenberg said she hoped it could be cathartic for families not able to hold large funerals or be with family and other loved ones given pandemic restrictions. Some are to strangers, but fellow Americans. She recalled one emergency room doctor who traveled to Washington from New York last fall to add the names of 12 patients he lost to COVID. He then turned around, she said, heading back to start a new shift. The exhibit is the largest participatory installation since the AIDS quilt was displayed on the National Mall in October 1987. Firstenberg said she hopes the flags, and the sound of them being pulled in the wind, will give visitors \"a moment of pause.\" \"This is all of our art,\" she said, \"because it\\'s when people personalize flags and a complete stranger comes and meets that flag and feels something, senses the grief that is embodied by just that one flag, they created the art, too.\" ]/>\\nPresident Joe Biden is trying to hammer out the worlds next steps against rapidly worsening climate change in a private, virtual session with a small group of other global leaders WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden tried on Friday to hammer out the world\\'s next steps against rapidly worsening climate change with a small group of other global leaders and announced a new U.S.-European pledge to cut climate-wrecking methane leaks. Ever-grimmer findings from scientists this year that the world is nearing the point where the level of climate damage from burning oil, gas and coal becomes catastrophic and irreversible \"represent a code red for humanity,\" Biden said at the session\\'s outset. \"We have to act and we have to act now,\" Biden said, speaking on a specially erected White House set that showed virtual arrays of solar panels in the background and a wall of other global leaders listening on screens. Biden, in the public opening of the otherwise private talks, hailed a new U.S. agreement with the European Union aiming at cutting the two entities emissions of methane 30% by the end of this decade. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is one of the most potent agents of climate damage, gushing up by the ton from countless uncapped oil and gas rigs, leaky natural gas pipelines and other oil and gas facilities. Biden evoked the \"damage and destruction\" he had seen in the United States, massive flooding in Europe and other global damage from the warming climate. He cited his trips earlier this month to California, where firefighters are battling larger, fiercer and deadlier wildfires almost year-round as temperatures rise and drought worsens, and to the northeastern U.S. and Gulf Coast, where Hurricane Ida and its flooding killed scores, as natural disasters increase in number and severity under climate change. As Biden spoke Friday, California firefighters were trying to stop fires from reaching ancient groves of sequoias that are thousands of years old and the height of high-rises. The White House billed Friday\\'s meeting as a chance for some of the world leaders to strategize how to achieve big, fast cuts in climate-wrecking petroleum and coal emissions. The administration also is trying to re-establish the United States\\' Major Economies Forum -- a climate group set up by former President Barack Obama and revived by Biden -- as a significant forum for international climate negotiations. Friday\\'s meeting followed a much bigger and splashier virtual White House climate summit in April that saw scores of heads of governments -- representing allies and rivals, and big economies and small -- making sweeping speeches about the need to act against climate change. The list provided of Fridays attendees included only a dozen leaders: those of Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, the European Commission, the European Council, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United Nations. China, India and Russia, with the United States, are the nations that emit the most climate-damaging gases from the production and burning of oil, natural gas and coal. There was no word on their leaders\\' taking part. However, the White House said in a statement that Biden\\'s climate envoy, John Kerry, led a minister-level climate session afterward with China, Germany, India and Russia. It gave no other details. Climate advocates have stressed the importance of the U.S. coordinating with Europe and Asia for a joint front in coaxing China, which emits more climate-damaging fumes than the rest of the developed world combined, to move faster on cutting its use of dirty-burning coal-fired power plants in particular. Fred Krupp, president of the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said cutting methane pollution is the single fastest, most effective strategy to slow the rate of warming. A 30% reduction in methane pollution should be only \"the entry point for this critical conversation. Many countries can and should aim even higher,\" he said. While methane is about 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide, it stays in the air only about a decade, which means cutting methane emissions achieves quicker climate action. The U.S.-EU pledge comes as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is set to propose stricter rules against methane emissions for the oil and gas sector, as laid out in one of Bidens first executive orders. The new rules, expected in the next two weeks, are likely to be stricter than an Obama-era standard set in 2016. The Obama standard was reinstated in June after Congress took the unusual step of invalidating a Trump-era EPA rollback of methane protections. The pending EPA rule is expected to restrict methane emissions from new and existing wells, including hundreds of thousands of older wells that are not subject to federal regulation under current law. Biden has sought to make the U.S. a leader again in global climate efforts after President Donald Trump removed the U.S. from the Paris climate accord. Biden promised at the April summit to cut greenhouse gas emissions 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Following through on that pledge depends in large part on passage of a $3.5 trillion budget bill that includes tax incentives and other policies to substantially cut fossil fuel pollution by the power sector. The Democratic-only legislation faces an uphill battle in Congress. Biden also is striving to get significant investment in climate-friendly measures such as charging stations for electric vehicles out of Congress, in the face of objections from Republicans and some Democrats. Fridays session will be followed by another closed-door session of 35 to 40 world leaders, to be hosted Monday morning by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The private sessions are seeking to ensure global leaders come to a November U.N. climate session with commitments of significant new actions to slow climate change. Biden and others bill the climate summit in Glasgow as a last chance for the world to commit to cutting use of fossil fuels fast enough to stave off the worse scenarios of global warming. \"We have to bring to Glasgow our highest possible ambitions,\" Biden said. \"Those that have not yet done so, time is running out.\" ------ Knickmeyer reported from Oklahoma City.\\nA search for Brian Laundrie, the boyfriend of 22-year-old Gabby Petito, resumed on Sunday in a 24,565-acre preserve in Florida as authorities more than 2,300 miles away combed Grand Teton National Park for clues on the whereabouts of the woman who went missing during the couple\\'s cross-country road trip. North Port, Florida, police said a team of officers picked up the search for Laundrie in the Carlton Reserve north of Laundrie\\'s home in North Port. The search began on Saturday but was suspended overnight due to darkness. \"A team of more than 50 looking for anything of note after his (Laundrie\\'s) parents say this is where he went,\" North Port police said in a post on Twitter Sunday morning. Laundrie has been named by police as a \"person of interest\" in Petito\\'s disappearance. The 23-year-old Laundrie, who returned home more than two weeks ago without Petito and has refused to speak to the police, has not been seen since Tuesday, according to law enforcement officials. \"Be advised that the whereabouts of Brian Laundrie are currently unknown,\" an attorney for the Laundrie family said Friday. \"The FBI is currently at the Laundrie residence removing property to assist in locating Brian. As of now, the FBI is now looking for both Gabby and Brian.\" North Port police officers accompanied by FBI agents, drones, K-9 and bloodhounds are involved in the search for Laundrie, police said during a briefing Saturday afternoon. Authorities took clothing from the family home Friday to help canine units, North Port Police spokesperson Josh Taylor said. Laundrie\\'s family told police on Friday that they last saw him on Tuesday with a backpack and he told them he was going to the massive preserve, which he would frequent for hikes, according to Taylor. \"Our goal is to get answers. We love to be able to find Gabby. And right now we need to find Brian, too. Not only is he missing, but he potentially holds some key information in helping us find Gabby,\" Taylor told ABC News on Saturday night. \"We have to locate him. We\\'re hopeful to bring him in because I think he does have some information that will really lead us to Gabby. And that is the primary objective, to find this little girl.\" In response to the news that Laundrie\\'s whereabouts were unknown, a lawyer for the Petito family said in a statement: \"All of Gabby\\'s family want the world to know that Brian is not missing, he is hiding. Gabby is missing.\" The search for Laundrie is the latest twist in the case that has grabbed national attention as the couple had been traveling across the country since June in Petito\\'s 2012 Ford Transit and documenting the trip on social media. Laundrie returned home in Petito\\'s van to North Port, on Sept. 1 without his girlfriend, according to police. Petito\\'s parents reported her missing on Sept. 11 after not speaking with her for two weeks. As the search for Petito continues, FBI Denver said in an update Saturday evening that authorities are \"conducting ground surveys\" at the Spread Creek Dispersed Camping Area in Wyoming\\'s Grand Teton National Park. The FBI asked for anyone who saw the couple\\'s white van, with Florida license plate QFTG03, to contact the FBI. Taylor confirmed that investigators have spoken to Miranda Baker, a college student who posted a TikTok video over the weekend claiming she and her boyfriend picked up Laundrie around 5:30 p.m. on Aug. 29 as he was hitchhiking alone in the Colter Bay Village area of the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. In the video, Baker said Laundrie offered her and her boyfriend $200 to drive him to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \"He told us he\\'s been camping for multiple days without his fiancee. He did say he had a fiancee and that she was working on their social media page back at their van,\" Baker said in the video. She said that during the ride, Laundrie \"freaked out\" and demanded to be let out of the vehicle. \"He\\'s like, \\'Nope, I need to get out right now. You have to pull over,\\'\" Baker said in the video and later in an interview with ABC\\'s \"Good Morning America.\" Baker said she and her boyfriend let Laundrie out near the Jackson Lake Dam a little after 6 p.m. She said Laundrie had a backpack and was dressed in a long-sleeve shirt, pants, hiking boots and had a scruffy beard. \"For someone who was camping for multiple days, he didn\\'t look dirty. He didn\\'t smell dirty,\" Baker said. Asked about Baker\\'s purported encounter with Laundrie, Taylor told ABC News on Sunday, \"We have spoken to her. Her timeline is plausible.\" The FBI specifically said it would like to talk to anyone who was at the Spread Creek Dispersed Camping Area from Aug. 27 to 30 and may have seen the couple or their van. The agency said it would not comment on the specifics of the information in its investigation. North Port police were also forced to clear up a rumor about finding a body in the Carlton Reserve that spread on social media Saturday, saying it was \"completely fake.\" Petito was last seen on Aug. 24 leaving a hotel room in Utah. The next day, she spoke to her mother, Nichole Schmidt, telling her that their next stops would be at Grand Teton and Yellowstone, Schmidt told ABC News. Schmidt received two text messages from her daughter\\'s phone in the days after speaking to her, but it was unclear whether they were actually sent by Petito \"Many people are wondering why Mr. Laundrie would not make a statement or speak with law enforcement in the face of Ms. Petito\\'s absence,\" the attorney representing the Laundrie family, Steven P. Bertolino, said in a statement last week. \"In my experience, intimate partners are often the first person law enforcement focuses their attention on in cases like this, and the warning that \\'any statement will be used against you\\' is true, regardless of whether my client had anything to do with Ms. Petito\\'s disappearance. As such, on the advice of counsel, Mr. Laundrie is not speaking on this matter.\" The North Port Police Department said Friday afternoon it had entered the family\\'s home, where Brian was believed to be staying, to speak with the family \"at their request.\" The police later tweeted Friday, \"The conversation at the Laundrie home is complete. Once we have the details, a statement will be made. We ask for calm! Please let us work through this and information will be forthcoming.\" It was after that tweet that the family lawyer released the statement saying the location of Brian Laundrie was unknown. \"We\\'ve been trying to reach the family all week. This is the first time we\\'ve had communication with them, and now they\\'re telling us that he\\'s been gone for essentially the last four days,\" Taylor said in an interview with \"Good Morning America\" Saturday. Laundrie\\'s family told police about where he went after becoming \"concerned about his whereabouts\" and wanted to file a missing person\\'s report, Taylor told reporters Saturday. Laundrie\\'s car was at the Carlton Reserve but then found again at the family\\'s home, police said. When pressed by reporters as to how the car would have gotten back without a sign of Laundrie, Taylor said, \"We are going by [the family\\'s] word.\" Bertolino, the Laundrie family attorney, told ABC News the family picked up the car after going out to look for their son. Bertolino said the family went to the reserve Wednesday to look for him and spotted a note from the North Port Police Department on the car saying it needed to be removed. The family left the car overnight \"so he could drive back,\" the attorney said. When Laundrie didn\\'t come home Thursday morning, the family went back to retrieve the car, according to Bertolino. People had gathered outside the Laundrie home throughout the day Friday, some with bullhorns, chanting \"Where is Gabby?\" and calling on Brian Laundrie or the family to talk to authorities. Those people were moved from the lawn to the sidewalk as they chanted toward the house. Brian\\'s sister, Cassandra Laundrie, spoke to ABC News on Thursday night, saying she had spoken to police about Petito\\'s disappearance but was mostly learning details from the news. \"Obviously, me and my family want Gabby to be found safe,\" she said. \"She is like a sister and my children love her, and all I want is for her to come home safe and sound and this be just a big misunderstanding.\" The Grand County Sheriff\\'s Office in Moab, Utah, said last week that Petito and Laundrie did not appear to be connected to the murders of two women at a campground in mid-August. The sheriff\\'s office said on Thursday it had been in contact with Florida authorities about investigating a possible connection to the double murder. The two women were last seen leaving a bar on Aug. 13, one day after authorities were called about a disagreement between Petito and Laundrie while they were traveling in Moab. The couple\\'s white van had been pulled over after a witness called police about an altercation between the two at the Arches National Park. Moab police released body camera footage of the couple admitting they had been arguing and that Petito had slapped Laundrie, according to a police report. The couple told police that Laundrie had not hit Petito. There was \"insufficient evidence existed to justify criminal charges,\" Moab Police Department Chief Bret Edge said in a statement Tuesday. ABC News\\' Alondra Valle, Julia Jacobo, Joshua Hoyos and Matt Foster contributed to this report.\\nA judge formally approved a plan Friday to turn OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma into a new company no longer owned by members of the Sackler family and with its profits going to fight the opioid epidemic A judge formally approved a plan Friday to turn OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma into a new company no longer owned by members of the Sackler family and with its profits going to fight the opioid epidemic. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain officially confirmed the reorganization Friday, more than two weeks after he announced he would do so pending two largely technical changes to the plan presented by the company and hashed out with lawyers representing those with claims against the company. His confirmation took more than six hours to read in court earlier this month, and the written version is 159 pages long, full of reasoning that appeals courts can consider later. Several states among other parties have already appealed the decision. The deal resolves some 3,000 lawsuits filed by state and local governments, Native American tribes, unions, hospitals and others who claimed the company\\'s marketing of prescription opioids helped spark and continue an overdose epidemic linked to more than 500,000 deaths in the U.S. in the last two decades. The plan will use company profits and $4.5 billion in cash and charitable assets from members of the Sackler family to pay some individual victims amounts expected to range from $3,500 to $48,000, and help fund opioid treatment and prevention programs across the U.S. Members of the Sackler family are also required to get out of the opioid business worldwide in time. Millions of company documents, including communications with company lawyers, are to be made public. The changes are to take effect when the bankruptcy process is finalized; the earliest that could be is in December. The attorneys generals from the states of Connecticut, Maryland, Washington and the District of Columbia, as well as the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee have all announced appeals. Their chief objection is that members of the wealthy Sackler family would be granted protection from lawsuits over opioids. For many people in recovery from opioid addictions or who have lost loved ones to overdoses, the deal is infuriating. Ellen Isaacs, a mother whose son died from an overdose, filed court papers requesting Drain not accept the plan. At a hearing on Monday, she gave a passionate some sometimes tearful 40-minute speech on her request. Like other activists, she asserted that Sackler family members -- who have never been charged with criminal wrongdoing -- are getting away with crimes, and that politicians and courts are not doing enough to end the opioid epidemic. \"The attorneys are playing games on paper and humans are dying,\" she said. Drain said the money from the settlement would help avert more deaths, even if it will come too late for Isaacs\\' son. \"I did not become a judge to get things wrong,\" he told her. He stood by his confirmation of the plan. At the hearing, Drain also said he would approve a request from Purdue to use nearly $7 million to start setting up the funds that will distribute settlement money to victims, government entities and others. He also, for the third year, approved a plan of incentive payments for Purdue executives if they meet certain goals.\\nA small earthquake has shaken the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, but there arent any immediate reports of major damage or injuries CARSON, Calif. -- A small earthquake shook the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area Friday night, but there weren\\'t any immediate reports of major damage or injuries. The magnitude-4.3 quake struck shortly after 7:58 p.m. and was centered near Carson, about 21 miles (34 kilometers) southeast of downtown LA, according to preliminary information from the U.S. Geological Survey website. Its depth was reported at about 9 miles (14 kilometers), the USGS reported. Some people reported feeling a jolt ranging from a moment to as much as 10 seconds across the area. It was felt widely, from neighboring cities such as Santa Monica, Torrance and Beverly Hills to the Antelope Valley an hour\\'s drive north and south to Orange County and possibly beyond. The Marathon Petroleum refinery in Carson lost power and began burning off excess gases in a process known as flaring that sent flames into the sky and prompted calls from people concerned that there was a fire. \"Flares are safety devices and the flares are functioning as intended. There are no injuries or off-site impact,\" company spokesman Jamal Kheiry told the Los Angeles Times in an email. The Los Angeles Fire Department went into earthquake emergency mode, sending vehicles and helicopters to patrol its 470 square miles (1,217-square-kilometer) area but said it didn\\'t receive any reports of \"significant damage or injury,\" according to a department statement. Seismologist Lucy Jones told KCBS-TV that the quake \"doesn\\'t look abnormal at all.\" \"This size happens on average somewhere in Southern California every couple of months,\" she said. \"When it happens to be in the middle of the Los Angeles basin then a lot more people feel it and it becomes bigger news.\"\\nThe group will discus and vote on whether to recommend Pfizer booster shots. The Food and Drug Administration\\'s independent advisory committee will convene in open session Friday to review the latest data submitted by Pfizer and discuss whether a booster dose is safe enough for widespread use and whether it\\'s necessary and effective at improving protection levels against COVID-19. Their vote will be non-binding -- the FDA is not required to follow the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee\\'s (VRBPAC) recommendations -- but they generally do so. After that vote, the FDA will decide whether they will formally amend their current vaccine approval for Pfizer. Next week the matter heads to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s independent advisory panel (ACIP), where that panel will weigh on a more granular level who should get a booster and when? The CDC director will then formally sign off on whatever ACIP recommends. Friday morning\\'s opening remarks are set to kick off at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by introductions by the FDA, presentations from CDC representatives, a discussion about booster protection and a presentation from Pfizer executives who will make the case for why boosters are appropriate. After a public hearing portion in the afternoon and a question-and-answer session on both Pfizer\\'s and the FDA\\'s presentations, the committee will debate the issue for roughly two hours. A vote is expected at about 4:45 p.m. ET, if they stay on schedule. The meeting Friday comes amid a contentious debate on the timeline for boosters, with some health experts vehement that the data and timing is still premature. Two top FDA officials who are leaving the agency later this year publicly waded into the debate on Monday, splitting from the agency and arguing in a scientific journal that it was too soon to give booster shots to the general public since the vaccines still offer strong protection against serious disease. Both are scheduled to attend Friday\\'s discussion. One of them, the director of the agency\\'s office of vaccines research and review, is supposed to give an overarching introduction of the topic for the FDA in the beginning of the day. Also joining Friday\\'s meeting is the head of Israel\\'s public health services, Dr. Sharon Alroy Preis, who is set to present data on booster protection against COVID infection and severe disease. In a review of Pfizer\\'s data, also released Wednesday, the FDA appeared to be noncommittal on the necessity for boosters. The agency pointed out that Pfizer\\'s efficacy data could be hampered by the limitations of studying boosters in real-world situations, which can introduce complicating factors. \"There are many potentially relevant studies, but FDA has not independently reviewed or verified the underlying data or their conclusions,\" the agency wrote in its briefing. Naming no one -- but nodding to those lingering concerns -- Pfizer\\'s CEO Albert Bourla penned an open letter on Thursday making the case for booster shots. \"This week we are approaching another pivotal moment in our ongoing fight against the virus,\" Bourla writes of Friday\\'s FDA advisory committee. \"Since the start of this pandemic, Pfizer and BioNTech have pledged to follow the science and keep people informed about our progress to help bring an end to this global health crisis. We have stayed true to our commitment of full transparency without selectively cherry-picking data.\" ABC News\\' Sony Salzman, Eric M. Strauss and Cheyenne Haslett contributed to this report.\\nOne of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol says he will not seek reelection next year AKRON, Ohio -- One of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol announced he will not seek reelection in Ohio next year. U.S. Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, a former NFL player with a once-bright political future, cited his two young children for his decision and noted \"the chaotic political environment that currently infects our country.\" He is the first Latino to represent Ohio in Congress. \"While my desire to build a fuller family life is at the heart of my decision, it is also true that the current state of our politics, especially many of the toxic dynamics inside our own party, is a significant factor in my decisions,\" Gonzalez said in his statement Thursday night. Gonzalez, 36, would have faced Max Miller in the 2022 primary. Trump has endorsed Miller, his former White House and campaign aide, as part of his bid to punish those who voted for his impeachment or blocked his efforts to overturn the results of the election. Trump rallied for Miller this summer. In a statement, Miller\\'s campaign called Gonzalez\\'s announcement \"good news for the voters of our district,\" said Gonzalez had \"dishonored the office by betraying his constituents\" with his impeachment vote. Gonzalez represents northeast Ohio\\'s 16th Congressional District, in the northeastern part of the state. The Ohio Republican Party censured Gonzalez in May for voting in February to impeach Trump. Gonzalez has stood by his impeachment vote in the face of fierce pushback from his partys conservative wing. It remains unclear whether any of the other House Republicans who joined Gonzalez in voting for impeachment will follow in his footsteps. In an interview with The New York Times announcing his decision, Gonzalez called Trump \"a cancer for the country\" who represents a threat to democracy and said that Jan. 6 had been \"a line-in-the-sand moment\" for him. While he said there seemed to have been a moment then when the party might break with the former president, he has been dismayed by its decision to instead embrace Trump. \"This is the direction that were going to go in for the next two years and potentially four, and its going to make Trump the center of fund-raising efforts and political outreach,\" Gonzalez told the newspaper. \"Thats not something Im going to be part of.\" He said he plans to spend his time now working to prevent Trump from being elected to the White House again. \"Most of my political energy will be spent working on that exact goal,\" he said. Trump called Gonzalez\\'s decision not to seek reelection \"no loss for Ohio or our Country.\" In a statement Friday that also praised Miller, the former president said Gonzalez quit after losing popularity following his vote for impeachment.\\nA hostess in New York City was assaulted after asking patrons from Texas to show proof of their vaccination status when they entered a restaurant, authorities said. New York City mandates that those 12 and older seeking to dine indoors show proof of having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, though enforcement of the policy has largely fallen on front-line hospitality workers. The incident took place at Carmine\\'s Italian Restaurant in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan on Thursday evening, according to the New York Police Department. Three women from Texas -- a 44-year-old and her 21-year-old daughter, as well as another 49-year-old -- tried to enter the restaurant when they were asked for proof of vaccination, according to the police department. The women then assaulted the 24-year-old hostess and broke her necklace during the attack, police said. The victim refused medical attention. Authorities have not released the names of the accused, each of whom was taken into custody and given a desk appearance ticket, the NYPD said. The investigation remains ongoing. \"Our goal is to serve our customers great food, offer excellent service and hospitality while keeping our employees and customers safe as we comply with the government-mandated COVID-19 protocols,\" a Carmine\\'s Italian Restaurant spokesperson said. \"It\\'s a shocking and tragic situation when one of our valued employees is assaulted for doing their job -- as required by city policies -- and trying to make a living.\" \"Our focus right now is caring for our employee and the rest of our restaurant family,\" the statement added. \"We are a family-style restaurant, and this is the absolute last experience any of our employees should ever endure and any customers witness.\" The New York City Hospitality Alliance, a nonprofit trade group representing workers in the industry, called on New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to increase awareness of the vaccine requirements for indoor dining, especially to visitors who may be unaware of it, and heighten penalties for noncompliance. \"Assaulting a restaurant worker for doing their job is abhorrent and must be punished,\" Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, said in a statement. \"We\\'re calling on the City and State of New York to immediately increase penalties for assaulting restaurant workers in New York City in conjunction with enforcement of Covid-19 protocols.\" Like mask mandates throughout 2020, vaccine mandates have emerged as a hot-button issue in the U.S. even as a global pandemic rages. Despite the urging of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and assurances from health authorities that vaccines are safe and effective, many Americans are still refusing the jab -- decisions that likely have contributed to a recent resurgence of virus cases propelled by the highly contagious delta variant. As of Friday, some 74.2% of the U.S. population 12 years of age and older had received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 63.5% were fully vaccinated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Just last week, the U.S. reached the a milestone: COVID-19 has killed 1 in every 500 Americans. ABC News\\' Darren Reynolds contributed to this report.\\nThe man allegedly made two threatening calls to the clinic in April. The Justice Department has announced charges against an Ohio man accused of making threats against a local reproductive health services clinic. Newly unsealed charging documents allege Carlos Manuel Rodriquez Brime, 25, of making two separate threats via telephone to the Your Choice Healthcare facility in Columbus on April 11. \"My girlfriend is a patient there and I\\'m going to bring the heat. If she kills my baby, I\\'m going to kill her,\" Brime allegedly said in the first call. A little over two hours later, Brime called again and made a bomb threat, saying, \"My organization will be bringing a bomb to your facility. I suggest you close your doors.\" Brime was charged with one count of violating the FACE Act, which makes it a crime to threaten anyone receiving or providing reproductive health services. In recent weeks, the Justice Department has vowed aggressive enforcement of the FACE Act in Texas against anyone who levies threats against those seeking abortions or reproductive health clinic workers, after the state\\'s restrictive law banning most abortions took effect earlier this month. Brime is also charged with two other counts making threatening statements and making a bomb threat. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, according to the DOJ. He was arrested Thursday and ordered to remain detained pending further legal proceedings. He has not yet entered a plea in his case and his arraignment is scheduled for next Thursday. A public defender listed as representing Brime did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\\nTwo Delaware women who confronted supporters of former President Donald Trump and took a \"Make America Great Again\" hat from them at the 2020 Democratic National Convention have been sentenced to probation WILMINGTON, Del. -- Two Delaware women who confronted supporters of former President Donald Trump and took a \"Make America Great Again\" hat from them at the 2020 Democratic National Convention have been sentenced to probation. In a video viewed millions of times on social media, Olivia Winslow and Camryn Amy were seen ripping apart a Trump poster and taking a red MAGA hat from Trump supporters who were protesting Joe Biden\\'s victory as the Democratic nominee for president. The News Journal of Wilmington reports that Winslow and Amy, both 21 at the time, were each sentenced Friday on misdemeanor charges of theft, child endangerment and hate crimes. Neither will serve time in jail. Judge Francis Jones went along with prosecutors recommendation in sentencing the women to multiple counts of conditional probation. If they attend required anger management counseling and complete 40 hours of community service, the probation will be lifted, Jones said. \"We have all had moments of pettiness and immaturity,\" said Thomas Foley, Winslows attorney. He said that his client has \"learned a great deal\" and \"paid a tough price.\" She and Amy have both received hate mail and death threats since Students for Trump tweeted the video. The adult male victim of the incident said the harassment the women received has been \"punishment enough,\" according to a submitted statement. \"I wish things did not get so out of hand from the start,\" he wrote. \"I hope they can use this to move forward.\" Jones said he took the victims wishes into account in sentencing, including his agreement to drop charges of assault, attempted assault and conspiracy in the plea deal. Amy and Winslow, both of Wilmington, offered apologies after their sentencing. \"Im ashamed of my actions that day,\" Winslow said.\\nBy early next year, all eligible students attending a Los Angeles public school will be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The school district is the largest in the country to mandate the shot -- which joins a list of other vaccines already required to attend school that protect against highly contagious diseases. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have vaccine requirements for children to attend school and child care facilities, including laws around allowable exemptions. Massachusetts became the first state to enact a school vaccination requirement in the 1850s for the smallpox vaccine -- the first immunization developed against a contagious disease -- according to a publication by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other states followed suit, and by the 1980-1981 school year, all states had vaccination requirements for students entering the classroom, the CDC said. Children in close proximity with poor ventilation and hygiene practices can lead to \"transmission events,\" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children\\'s Hospital and an ABC News contributor. \"This is why vaccine mandates in schools have been super important,\" Brownstein said. \"They create a safe environment where you can recognize that you will not have transmission of a wide range of infectious diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough.\" The mandates have been \"very successful\" in preventing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, he said. Thanks to vaccination efforts, many highly contagious diseases that were once common, such as measles, mumps, whooping cough (aka pertussis) and chickenpox, are now rare, while polio and smallpox have been eradicated in the U.S. Routine child vaccination is estimated to prevent 936,000 premature deaths and 419 million illnesses in American children born between 1994 and 2018, according to the CDC. Vaccine mandates for child care and schools vary by state. All require vaccines that protect against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles and rubella, according to the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC), a vaccine education and advocacy organization. Nearly all states require vaccines that protect against mumps, chickenpox, hepatitis B and pneumococcal disease. Vaccines that aren\\'t widely required by states include ones for the flu, hepatitis A, rotavirus and HPV, according to IAC. The U.S. stopped routine vaccination for smallpox -- which has been eradicated globally -- in the 1970s. \"Precedents have been set that you can protect your community by requiring school vaccination requirements,\" L.J Tan, chief policy and partnerships officer for IAC, told ABC News. For the 2019-2020 school year, about 95% of children in kindergarten in the U.S. had received the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis), MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines, according to the CDC, with roughly 5% exempt from or not up to date on certain doses. The agency has observed a decrease in vaccination rates during the pandemic, as COVID-19 has disrupted school and routine well visits for many families. There was a 14% drop in public sector vaccine ordering in 2020-2021 compared to 2019, and measles vaccine ordering decreased by over 20%, the CDC reported. The decline in routine pediatric immunizations has been very concerning for public health experts. \"Whenever we have a decrease in coverage, that could be an opportunity for these infections to reemerge and cause outbreaks -- and one of the most obvious, recent examples is measles,\" Dr. Flor Munoz, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Texas Children\\'s Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told ABC News. In 2019, the U.S. saw its largest measles outbreak in 25 years, with 1,282 cases confirmed in 31 states, mostly among people not vaccinated against the virus, according to the CDC. It\\'s especially important that children stay up-to-date on vaccines as many return to in-person learning and routine activities, Munoz said. \"All of these other diseases that are vaccine-preventable can reemerge at any time,\" Munoz said. \"Vaccination is the easiest way and the best way to prevent any of these potentially serious infections.\" Pediatric COVID-19 rates have reached record levels in the U.S. as students return to school. In the last two weeks, nearly half a million children have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the latest report on pediatric coronavirus cases from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\\'s Hospital Association. Pfizer\\'s COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for people as young as 12 and approved by the Food and Drug Administration for those ages 16 and up. The pharmaceutical company has said it plans to submit vaccine safety data on 5- to 11-year-olds to the FDA by the end of September. Currently, no state requires the COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12 and older for school entry, though some are mandating it for certain state employees and many colleges are requiring it for students. At the same time, at least nine states have barred schools from mandating that students get the vaccine, including Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas, according to the Associated Press. The Los Angeles Unified School District\\'s Board of Education last week approved a mandate that students ages 12 and up be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Jan. 10, 2022, to attend class in-person. At this time, the school district said it is not requiring booster shots, which the Biden administration is planning to be made available as soon as next week for the general public at least eight months after their second dose. Beyond Los Angeles, nearby Culver City is mandating that public school students get the vaccine this school year, and two San Francisco Bay Area districts are considering the same. More school districts may likely follow suit, creating a \"domino effect,\" Brownstein said, especially as younger children become eligible to get the vaccine. \"A safe vaccine that can prevent transmission, protect our kids and ensure that they can stay in in-person learning actually makes a lot of sense,\" he said. \"And there\\'s historical precedent for doing so.\"\\nVaccine experts advising the federal government on Friday rejected President Joe Biden\\'s plan to begin rolling out boosters for all Americans, suggesting instead that extra Pfizer shots should only be given to those 65 and older or those at high risk of severe COVID-19. The panel also said it supports giving boosters to health care and other front-line workers, including teachers. The booster shot would be administered six months after a person\\'s second Pfizer dose. A final decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected within days. \"We need safety data for younger populations and we need to really know what the benefit is,\" Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, said Friday in an interview with ABC News correspondent Whit Johnson. \"So far we\\'ve got some reasonable data for older people, but I really think that there are too many questions on the younger populations,\" Faust added. The plan recommended by the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is considerably more cautious than initially laid out by Pfizer and embraced by the White House. Pfizer, the first vaccine maker to administer shots in the U.S. more than nine months ago, had cited extensive data in Israel and elsewhere showing the vaccine\\'s robust protection began to wane with time. Following Friday\\'s vote, the company said it would continue working with the FDA. \"These data, and the larger body of scientific evidence presented at the meeting, underscore our belief that boosters will be a critical tool in the ongoing effort to control the spread of this virus,\" said Kathrin Jansen, senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer. Among the concerns by health experts is the lack of safety data on young people related to boosters, particularly in light of rare reports of heart inflammation. While many Americans have already opted for third shots, with doctors administering them \"off-label,\" it\\'s up to independent federal regulators to decide how the vaccines are labeled and administered. The debate has become unusually charged, in part because of White House involvement. President Joe Biden said he would only act on rolling out boosters if the FDA and CDC agreed. But his public pronouncement that the rollout would begin as early as Sept. 20 suggested the decision was a foregone conclusion, leading to accusations by some scientists that the Biden administration was pressuring independent regulators. \"Get a booster shot,\" Biden declared in a speech last month. \"It will make you safer, and for longer, and it will help us end the pandemic faster.\" If the FDA signs off on the latest plan for boosters for seniors and health care workers, the CDC also has to weigh in. A key meeting is planned Wednesday by a separate group of experts that advises the CDC and will likely discuss who exactly should get the extra doses. After that CDC recommendation is made, booster shots would be available through any of the nation\\'s 40,000 pharmacies, doctors offices and other sites already offering the Pfizer vaccine. The CDC has said vaccines still offer extraordinary protection against hospitalization and death, with more than 90% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 being unvaccinated. At Friday\\'s FDA briefing, a CDC official said vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in adults age 75 and older remained at about 88% through July. But there were other signs that immunity waned with time. A new Israeli study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found 11-fold lower rates of infection and nearly 20-fold lower rates of severe COVID-19 among people older than 60 who got a booster dose. A separate Israel Ministry of Health analysis estimated approximately 10-fold improved protection against infection and severe COVID-19 among people who got a booster. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health services at Israel\\'s Health Ministry, told the panel on Friday that Israel became concerned when it saw cases of fully vaccinated residents infecting other members of their households and -- at times -- winding up hospitalized. \"We definitely see that cases that are vaccinated -- doubly vaccinated -- that are no longer fresh\" six months from their second dose, Alroy-Preis said. These vaccinated cases \"are infecting other people. It\\'s obviously less than non-vaccinated [people]. But we\\'re seeing that, especially in their household.\" ABC News\\' Sony Salzman contributed to this report.\\nThey went the farthest any civilian has traveled from Earth. After three days in space, the first all-civilian flight into Earth\\'s orbit splashed down successfully Saturday night. The Dragon capsule returned to Earth just after 7 p.m. ET. The capsule was traveling at 17,500 mph when it deorbited, slowed down to around 350 mph when the parachute deployed at 18,000 feet and slowed to 119 mph before it hit the ocean. It splashed down in its preferred location in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Cape Canaveral. They had been prepared to pivot to the Gulf of Mexico, if needed. SpaceX\\'s Inspiration4 mission made history as the farthest any civilian has traveled from Earth -- 367 miles above it -- even farther than the International Space Station. There is always risk launching into space and coming home. While the crew has been trained by SpaceX, they are not professional astronauts. Saturday\\'s splashdown was the third SpaceX Dragon-crewed capsule to splash down from orbit, but the first with no professional astronaut on board. Billionaire Jared Isaacman, 38, an experienced pilot, is commanding the mission. He founded a payment process company called Shift4 Payments and purchased all four seats on the flight for an estimated $220 million. Isaacman wanted this mission to benefit St. Jude Children\\'s Research Hospital. Before the launch he personally donated $100 million to help end child cancer. After the crew\\'s return, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said on Twitter he would chip in $50 million to the fundraising goal for St. Jude as well. Isaacman reserved one seat for 29-year-old St. Jude ambassador Hayley Arceneaux. Arceneaux was treated at St. Jude as a child and returned to work there as a physician assistant. She is now the youngest American to go to space as well as the first pediatric cancer survivor. Dr. Sian Proctor, 51, the third occupant, made history as well as the fourth African American woman astronaut to travel into space. Rounding out the crew was Chris Sembroski, 41, an Iraq war veteran and engineer with Lockheed Martin. They all spoke with children currently being treated at St. Jude live from space on Friday. \"What kind of sleeping bag do you have?\" one child asked Arceneaux. \"So if you\\'ve ever been camping, we pretty much have those same kind of sleeping bags,\" she said. \"We were in our sleeping bags on top of our chairs, but we were floating on top of the chair and we had a seat belt around our sleeping bag. So we didn\\'t fly away when we were sleeping.\" \"Can you take pictures in space?\" another child asked Proctor. \"We absolutely can take pictures in space,\" she responded. \"And we\\'ve been taking a lot of those pictures and video so we can capture this moment and share it with everybody when we come home.\" Since liftoff, the mission has raised an additional $500,000 for the research hospital. The crew has also been busy conducting experiments including using a portable ultrasound to measure their corneas and optic nerves for indications on intracranial pressure. \"We\\'ve also been taking several swabs of different parts of our body to evaluate the microbiome and how that changes in these three days in space,\" Arceanaux said.

Instead, cooperation has proved elusive. In New York, Ohio and Virginia, commissions meeting for the first time this year have splintered into partisan camps to craft competing redistricting maps based on 2020 census data. The divisions have disappointed some activists who supported the reforms and highlighted how difficult it can be to purge politics from the once-a-decade process of realigning boundaries for U.S. House and state legislative seats. As a result, the new state House and Senate districts in Republican-led Ohio will still favor the GOP. Democrats who control New York could still draw maps as they wish. And a potential stalemate in Virginia could eventually kick the process to the courts. \"Its probably predictable that this is sort of how it\\'s panned out,\" said Alex Keena, a political scientist at Virginia Commonwealth University who has analyzed redistricting and gerrymandering. Redistricting can carry significant consequences. Subtle changes in district lines can solidify a majority of voters for a particular party or split its opponents among multiple districts to dilute their influence. Republicans need to net just five seats to regain the U.S. House in the 2022 elections, which could determine the fate of President Joe Biden\\'s remaining agenda. Throughout most of American history, redistricting has been handled by state lawmakers and governors who have an incentive to draw lines favoring their own parties. But as public attention to gerrymandering has grown in recent decades, voters in an increasing number of states have shifted the task to special commissions. Some commissions -- such as those in Arizona, California, Colorado and Michigan -- consist solely of citizens who hold the final say on what maps to enact. But others, such as in Ohio and Virginia, include politicians among their members or require their maps to be submitted to the legislature for final approval, as is the case in New York, Virginia and Utah. If New York\\'s Democratic-led Legislature rejects the work of the new commission (consisting for four Democrats, four Republicans and two independents), then lawmakers can draft and pass their own redistricting plans. The prospects of that increased last week, when Democrats and Republicans on the commission failed to agree and instead released competing versions of new maps for the U.S. House, state Senate and state Assembly. State Republican Party Chairman Nick Langworthy blasted the Democratic maps as \"wildly gerrymandered\" and accused Democratic commissioners of refusing to compromise. State Democratic Party Chairman Jay Jacobs countered that there was no reason to \"bend over backwards\" to try to draw as many Republican seats as possible. He added: \"Well be fair, but to a point.\" The commission\\'s division frustrated Jennifer Wilson, deputy director of the League of Women Voters of New York. The organization supported the 2014 ballot measure that created the commission and encouraged people to testify at the panel\\'s public hearings this year. \"It almost feels like a slap in the face to us and to all those people who spent the time to go and submit comments -- took time out of their daily lives to do that -- when its very obvious there was no regard for any of those comments,\" Wilson said. Frustration also is mounting in Ohio, where a commission dominated by Republican elected officials voted this past week to adopt a state legislative redistricting plan they favored. Because the plan had no Democratic support, the state constitution limits it to four years. Democrats on the panel called the maps unfair. But Republican Senate President Matt Huffman asserted that special interests pressured Democrats not to back a redistricting plan that could have lasted the entire next decade. Huffman said the new map likely would produce 62 Republican seats in the Ohio House and 23 in the Senate -- down just a couple in each chamber from the current GOP supermajorities. Experts estimate the state\\'s voters are more evenly divided, around 54% Republican to 46% Democratic. The partisan map came despite more than a dozen public hearings dominated by testimony from Ohio residents who said the current gerrymandered maps have left them out in the cold. \"Too many of us have had little say in who represents us and watched helplessly as laws are passed that hurt our families and ignore our needs,\" Areege Hammad, of CAIR-Ohio, a civil rights organization for Muslims, testified. She said the neighborhood around the Islamic Center of Cleveland, one of the regions largest Muslim populations, is fractured into multiple congressional and statehouse districts. \"Because of the way that districts are drawn, our elected officials have no incentive to be receptive, responsive or accessible to us or our concerns,\" she said. Michigans citizen redistricting commission released its first draft of a new state Senate and U.S. House map this past week and is still working on a state House map. It\\'s planning to take more public comment on its proposals with a goal of finalizing maps by the end of the year -- blowing past the Nov. 1 deadline set in the constitutional amendment approved by voters. But the Michigan panel of four Democrats, four Republicans and five independents has so far avoided devolving into partisan encampments. One reason may be that Michigans commission includes no politicians and no ability for the Republican-led Legislature to override its work, Keena said. In Virginia, two separate mapmakers hired for Democrats and Republicans are to submit rival plans for consideration this coming week by the 16-member commission, which has four lawmakers and four citizens from each major party. If the commission can\\'t agree -- or the Democratic-led General Assembly rejects its maps -- the decision will fall to the state Supreme Court, which is dominated by GOP-appointed judges. How commissioners respond to the two maps will determine whether the reform effort works, said Liz White, executive director of OneVirginia2021, which supported last year\\'s ballot measure creating the commission. She hopes panelists find a way \"to marry\" the two proposals. \"Theres certainly a concern that two balanced sides just end in gridlock,\" White said. \"The hope really is that the citizens are there to make sure that doesnt happen.\" Even if the commission stalemates, the new process still could be considered an improvement over the previous one, because the public is getting to see deliberations and divisions that might otherwise have been kept behind closed doors, said Keena, of Virginia Commonwealth. \"Were going to be able to look back on this sort of experiment and see what works and what doesnt work,\" he said. \"Hopefully, that will lead to better reforms in the future.\" ------ Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.

Law enforcement leaders were unified in their message on Friday: We are prepared for the \"Justice for J6\" rally. The event on Saturday, billed as a protest against defendants being detained in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection, has law enforcement on high alert as they seek to avoid the kind of violence that ensued during the Capitol riot. \"There have been some threats of violence associated with the events for tomorrow. And we have a strong plan in place to ensure that it remains peaceful and that if violence does occur, that we can stop it as quickly as possible,\" U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Tom Manger told reporters at a press conference on Friday. \"Over the last eight months, the leadership of the U.S. Capitol Police Department has been preparing, working to ensure that we don\\'t have a repeat of January 6,\" Manger continued. Fencing around the Capitol complex started going up on Wednesday night, Capitol Police said, as part of the \"enhanced security posture\" to shield the Capitol from any violence that could break out. Manger told ABC News Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott he is most concerned about violent conflicts between protesters and counterprotesters. The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday warned that some individuals involved in or opposed to the rally \"may seek to engage in violence\" but said there was no \"specific or credible plot associated with the event,\" according to a bulletin shared with state and local law enforcement and obtained by ABC News. There was, however, a caveat. \"Lone offenders and small groups of individuals can mobilize to violence with little-to-no warning, particularly in response to confrontational encounters with perceived opponents or calls for escalation by key influencers,\" the bulletin says. \"The likely use of encrypted or closed communication platforms by those seeking to commit violence challenges law enforcement\\'s ability to identify and disrupt potential plotting.\" In early September, some social media users \"discussed storming the US Capitol on the night before the rally, and one user commented on kidnapping an identified member of Congress,\" the bulletin says. House offices were encouraged to work remotely Friday, according to a Thursday email from the House Administration Committee and obtained by ABC News. Melissa Smislova, the deputy under secretary for intelligence and enterprise readiness at the DHS, told attendees at the Homeland Security Enterprise Forum on Tuesday that the department expects 700 people in Washington for the event, the same number permitted to attend. Top DHS officials, including Homeland security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, have said they\\'ve stepped up their communications with state and local partners in advance of the event.

The base of General Sherman, the largest tree in the world by volume at 275 feet tall and over 36 feet wide, and other sequoias in Sequoia National Park\\'s Giant Forest have been covered in a protective foil due to the threat of intense heat from the KNP Complex fires. \"These trees are adaptive to fire, but not intense fire, so we want to do everything that we can to protect these trees as well as all these historic cabins that are on the national park,\" Steven Bekkerus, a public information officer for the KNP Complex, told Fresno ABC station KFSN Thursday. The Giant Forest, home to more than 2,000 giant sequoias, has a \"really good history\" of prescribed fires, though recent drought could but them at greater risk, according to Jon Wallace, an operations section chief for the KNP Complex. \"There\\'s a lot of concern with this drought this year, that that drought has decreased the resilience of those trees, even with all the prescribed fire that\\'s taken place,\" Wallace said in a video update Friday. The KNP Complex was ignited by lightning the night of Sept. 9 and is composed of the Paradise Fire and the Colony Fire. It has burned over 11,300 acres and is 0% contained. Crews have been prepping the Giant Forest, including removing fuel and applying foil wraps to the sequoias, before the area is potentially impacted as the fire \"continues to grow in all directions,\" the National Park Service said in an update Friday. Meanwhile, a second wildfire burning farther south in Sequoia National Forest threatens groves of sequoias in the 1.1-million-acre forest. The Windy Fire, which was also ignited by lightning on Sept. 9, has burned over 6,800 acres and is 0% contained. Earlier this week, crews were seen wrapping cabins and other structures in Sequoia National Forest in foil to protect them as the Windy Fire continues to grow. Sequoia National Park and parts of Sequoia National Forest are closed to the public due to the fires. Evacuation orders and warnings are in place for several communities in Tulare County, including in Three Rivers due to the KNP Complex and in Johnsondale, Camp Whitsett, Ponderosa and Quaking Aspen due to the Windy Fire. Heavy smoke has affected visibility, hindering aerial firefighting efforts, as well as air quality in the region. More than 10,400 personnel are helping fight 14 \"active large wildfires\" in the state, including the KNP Complex fires and Windy Fire, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. California\\'s massive sequoias, which shoot up hundreds of feet into the sky, have been around for thousands of years and have long withstood fires. But extreme fires and dry conditions driven by climate change are threatening the ancient trees. Last year\\'s Castle Fire wiped out 10% of the worlds native sequoias, according to the National Park Service.\\nA former University of Miami football player has pleaded not guilty to charges of killing a teammate outside a South Florida apartment complex in 2006 An attorney for Rashaun Jones, 35, entered the plea during a remote court hearing after prosecutors formally filed second-degree murder charge against him. Jones, who was arrested last month, was long suspected in the death of Bryan Pata, 22. Jones was originally arrested on a first-degree murder charge, and prosecutors said he could still face that charge. But to indict him on that charge, prosecutors would have to present the case to a grand jury. Pata was expected to be an early pick in the 2007 NFL draft following his fourth and final season with the Hurricanes. The 6-foot-4, 280-pound (1.9-meter, 127-kilogram) defensive lineman was shot several times outside of his Kendall apartment the night of Nov. 7, 2006. Some witnesses claimed to hear arguing and then gunshots. Despite having hundreds of dollars in his wallet, neither the car nor the cash were taken, police said. Investigators said they learned through numerous interviews that Pata and Jones, who played three seasons with the Hurricanes, had experienced confrontations before the shooting. Pata previously beat his teammate during a fight, officials said. And Patas brother told investigators that Jones had threatened to shoot Pata two months before his death. Despite the urging of his brother, Pata never reported the threat. During two interviews with detectives, Jones told investigators that he was at his own home and never left on the night of Patas death. But records show that Jones cellphone was using different cell towers around the time of the shooting, authorities said. And an eyewitness in the area at the time of the shooting identified Jones in a photo lineup, police said.\\nThe FDA and CDC are ironing out the details of who gets one and when. An advisory panel for the Food and Drug Administration weighed in on a debate Friday that has been boiling since the Biden administration announced last month that the country would begin to roll out booster shots against COVID-19. This panel, which is independent of the FDA and the Biden administration, decided boosters should be approved for people over 65, people with health conditions that put them at higher risk for serious illness from the virus and people who work on the frontlines, like health care workers or teachers. That was the first step of the process to getting additional shots to Americans, but it only applies to Pfizer, the first of the pharmaceutical companies to submit data. Next, the FDA must formally amend their current vaccine approval for Pfizer, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- which has its own advisory committee -- will then review the data and fine-tune the recommendation for who gets a booster and when. But the back-and-forth leading up to this process, and the president\\'s involvement in an otherwise non-political decision, has left many Americans confused. Here\\'s what we know. Do I need a booster shot, and if so, when? After reviewing the data and finding that the vaccines still hold up well against severe illness, an FDA panel on Friday recommended third shots of Pfizer only for the most vulnerable Americans and decided against recommending them for the whole population. \"The approval was for people 65 years of age or older, and a considerable number of people who are 18 to 64 who have underlying conditions that put them at a higher risk for severe disease, and people from 18 to 64 who are in institutional or occupational situations that would put them at an increased risk to exposure and infection,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said, chief medical advisor to the White House, said on ABC\\'s \"This Week\" Sunday. Fauci also said as more data comes in, the panel could decide to recommend more people for booster shots. But for now, the panel decided to limit the scope because it decided there wasn\\'t enough data on additional shots for young people. \"We need safety data for younger populations and we need to really know what the benefit is,\" Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, said Friday in an interview with ABC News correspondent Whit Johnson. \"So far we\\'ve got some reasonable data for older people, but I really think that there are too many questions on the younger populations,\" Faust added. But the panel also emphasized that for now, the data still shows that Americans are well protected if they\\'re vaccinated. And while breakthrough infections happen, particularly as protection against mild infection wanes, the vaccines continue to protect Americans from ending up in the hospital with COVID. The latest CDC data shows that 90% of hospitalized patients with COVID are people who are unvaccinated. At Friday\\'s FDA briefing, a CDC official said vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in adults age 75 and older -- a group that has consistently had slightly less protection from the vaccines -- still remained high, at about 88% through July. \"At the end of the day, the purpose of the vaccines is to prevent hospitalizations and deaths, and they\\'re doing that very effectively still,\" Dr. Carlos Del Rio, executive associate dean of Emory University School of Medicine, said in an interview with ABC News. \"Maybe a little less effective for people over the age of 60 or with comorbidities, but still, if you look around the hospitals, the people hospitalized today are people who haven\\'t received the vaccine.\" Additional vaccine doses, although not quite a booster, have already been approved by the CDC for the roughly 7 million immunocompromised Americans who didn\\'t have an optimal response to the first round of mRNA vaccines. Nearly 2 million Americans have gotten an additional shot since the FDA and CDC approved them in August for that subset of people. The CDC officially recommended a third dose of an mRNA vaccine for immunocompromised Americans in August, allowing the approximately 7 million Americans who didn\\'t get an optimal immune response to their initial vaccine doses of Pfizer or Moderna to gain more protection. There\\'s been a lot of debate as the process plays out. What\\'s the controversy? When the Biden administration announced that it would roll out a booster shot program beginning Sept. 20, the White House\\'s COVID response team said it was to get ahead of the virus. \"You don\\'t want to find yourself behind, playing catch up,\" Fauci said when announcing the plan. \"Better stay ahead of it than chasing after it.\" The White House has relied heavily on Israel\\'s data, which has showed that vaccine protection against serious disease has now begun to wane. Israel began its vaccination process sooner than the U.S., but there are also differences in the two countries, a CDC official said at the FDA meeting on Friday. Israel almost exclusively used Pfizer and vaccinated most people around the same time, while in the US, there are three different vaccines and people were vaccinated in a rolling fashion, meaning there is a much wider diversity of immunity. That was one reason why career scientists pushed back on the White House\\'s announcement, saying there wasn\\'t enough U.S. data to support boosters yet -- since all the current evidence shows vaccines still protect most Americans against serious disease. For experts in that camp, the focus usually narrows in on the 80 million Americans who aren\\'t vaccinated at all. Increasing protection across more of the country would stamp out transmission. \"We\\'re spending way too much time talking about boosters when we need to be spending time talking about the people that haven\\'t been vaccinated,\" said Del Rio. Del Rio noted, though, that the scientific process would eventually play itself out and deliver a solid, well-debated answer. Though it\\'s not usually as public of a process, it is normal, he said. \"People are seeing how the sausage is made,\" he said. And that\\'s what happened on Friday, though there is still a few more steps to go: Doctors and public health experts reviewed the data and made a call, which will now head to the next scientific committee for review. Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center and former adviser to the Biden administration, told ABC News that while the public debate over the next course of action on boosters had the potential to alarm people, people should rest assured that the vaccines are the best way out of the pandemic. \"I think any time there is confusion, there is debate about the science, that can add to vaccine hesitancy because it plants a seed in people\\'s mind that maybe we aren\\'t sure,\" Gounder said. \"What I can say is that we are very sure that these vaccines are safe and highly effective. And if you have not yet been vaccinated, now is the time to get vaccinated.\" The FDA and CDC committees are looking at Pfizer booster shots. What\\'s the deal with boosters for people who got J&J or Moderna? Both Johnson & Johnson and Moderna are expected to follow Pfizer and run their data by the official FDA and CDC channels in the coming weeks in an effort to get approval for booster shots. But both companies maintain protection is still strong against severe infection. Moderna, in an analysis of various studies released on Wednesday, even made the case that the company\\'s original vaccine appears to generate the strongest protection among the three currently authorized vaccines. Nevertheless, Moderna President Stephen Hoge told ABC News in an interview on Wednesday that \"protection is not permanent\" and \"we\\'re not going to be able to defy gravity forever.\" Newly published data from Moderna\\'s booster-shot trial showed a lower risk of breakthrough infections among people vaccinated eight months ago compared to people vaccinated 13 months ago. Unlike Pfizer, Moderna\\'s third shot would be a half-dose. They say their data shows that boosting with a half-shot seems to generate more than enough immune response. For J&J, the one-shot series about 14 million Americans received, a study found that the vaccine still provided a durable immune response at least eight months later, even without a booster dose. Another study, released Tuesday, found more good news: The J&J booster dose actually boosted antibody levels higher than they were after the initial shot. It also found that an additional shot later on, around six months after the first shot, boosted antibody levels higher than a shot given two months later. And while it will be a few weeks before there\\'s more concrete news on the J&J booster shots, there\\'s room in the timeline. Most Americans didn\\'t receive the J&J vaccine until late spring of 2020, since it was approved after the mRNA vaccines. That means the J&J boosters won\\'t be widely necessary until November at the earliest -- if the FDA and CDC decide they\\'re needed at all. There is not enough data yet on mixing and matching vaccines, though the CDC is actively researching it. And for all three of the vaccines, recipients have a common question: will I need to get a booster routinely? Experts, wary of predicting anything about the unpredictable global pandemic, said it\\'s possible, but unlikely. \"My prediction is that as long as the COVID rates are going down, we will not need a continuous boost,\" said Dr. Paul Goepfert, director of the Alabama Vaccine Research Clinic at the University of Alabama. That could change, however, if a new viral strain requires a newly tailored vaccine. Are booster shots safe? Pfizer, the only vaccine so far to have its data reviewed by the FDA, found no safety concerns among the 300 trial participants who were part of its clinical trial. Pfizer followed the participants for up to three months after getting their third shot. Peoples\\' reactions to the booster shots were not significantly different from their reactions to a second dose, FDA and Pfizer both wrote in their separate briefing documents. \"No deaths, vaccine-related serious adverse events, or events of myocarditis, pericarditis, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, or Bell\\'s palsy were reported among study participants who received the ... booster dose,\" the FDA wrote in a review of Pfizer\\'s safety data. Moderna and J&J have not yet had their data reviewed by the FDA, but have said they found no safety concerns in their clinical trials of booster shots.\\nThe FBI is joining the hunt for a missing 6-year-old in Honolulu, Hawaii. The search for 6-year-old Isabella Kalua continues as authorities in Honolulu deploy search dogs, the coast guard and volunteer search crews to find the young girl. According to the Honolulu Police Department, Isabella was last seen asleep in her room at her Puha Street address in Waimanalo on Sunday, Sept. 12, around 9 p.m. local time. Honolulu Police said they won\\'t rule out foul play just yet. \"I don\\'t want to think the worst case scenario,\" Alena Kaeo, Isabella\\'s aunt, told ABC\\'s Hawaii affiliate KITV. \"But it is always is a possibility. Again, I\\'m trying to keep my faith as strong as possible and I pray -- I pray hard that she is safe. I don\\'t want to think the worst but it is a possibility.\" Authorities say Isabella has brown eyes, brown hair and is mixed race. Isabella was likely wearing a black hoodie, black leggings, colorful socks and Nike slides when she went missing, police said. She is 3-feet, 3-inches tall and weighs 46 pounds. The search now spans from Waimanalo Beach to the Olomana Golf Course, and police are working with the FBI to investigate her disappearance. \"We have conducted numerous interviews; however, there are still individuals, to include acquaintances and family members, who have yet to come forward to be interviewed,\" police said in a statement to KITV. ABC News has reached out to HPD for comment.\\nU.S. Central Command Gen. Frank McKenzie admitted at a briefing Friday that the Aug. 29 drone strike near Kabul airport was \"a mistake.\" Ten people were killed in the strike, which the U.S. believed was targeting a terrorist, but instead killed an aid worker and others in the area. \"I am now convinced that as many as 10 civilians, including up to seven children were tragically killed in that strike,\" said McKenzie. \"Moreover, we now assess that it is unlikely that the vehicle and those who died or associated with ISIS-Khorasan or were a direct threat to U.S. forces.\" \"I offer my profound condolences to the family and friends of those who were killed,\" said McKenzie. He noted that the drone strike was carried out \"in the earnest belief that it would prevent and terminate a threat to our forces and the evacuees at the airport, but it was a mistake. And I offer my sincere apology.\" \"As a combatant commander,\" he added. \"I am fully responsible for this strike in this tragic outcome.\" Since the airstrike took place, military officials have pointed to a secondary explosion as indicating that the white Toyota Corolla was carrying explosives -- an explosion larger than would be expected from a Hellfire missile. McKenzie said Friday that the secondary explosion was caused by a propane tank that was next to the car when it was struck. Zemerai Ahmadi, the main target who was killed in the strike after he pulled his car into the driveway of his home, had worked for 15 years at Nutrition & Education International, a California-based nonprofit, according to The Associated Press. After Ahmadi parked the vehicle in a residential courtyard, he and another man were spotted loading what military officials believed to be explosives into the vehicle, a U.S. official told ABC News of the initial assessment. The strike was ordered as this was believed to be the final stages of planning for a car bombing. People who worked with Ahmadi at the aid organization said he was actually loading bottles of water into his vehicle, according to The New York Times. The strike came three days after 13 U.S. service members and as many as 170 Afghans were killed in a suicide attack outside Hamid Karzai International Airport during the frenzied withdrawal of Afghans hoping to escape the country in the wake of the Taliban taking over. ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing. \"We now know that there was no connection between Mr. Ahmadi and ISIS-Khorasan, that his activities on that day were completely harmless and not at all related to the imminent threat we believed we faced, and that Mr. Ahmadi was just as innocent a victim as were the others tragically killed,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Friday. \"I have directed a thorough review of the investigation just completed by U.S. Central Command,\" Austin\\'s statement continued. \"I have asked for this review to consider the degree to which the investigation considered all available context and information, the degree to which accountability measures need be taken and at what level, and the degree to which strike authorities, procedures and processes need to be altered in the future.\" Chairman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said: \"In a dynamic high threat environment, the commanders on the ground had appropriate authority and had reasonable certainty that the target was valid but after deeper post strike analysis our conclusion is that innocent civilians were killed. This is a horrible tragedy of war and its heart wrenching and we are committed to being fully transparent about this incident.\" In the wake of the announcement, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, raised concerns about the Defense Department\\'s initial defense of the Afghanistan drone strike. \"I am also concerned about the accuracy and completeness of public statements made in the immediate aftermath of the strike, and whether those accounted for all of the information possessed by the government at the time. We must assure that the Department examines its actions carefully and objectively, even in the absence of press reports, such as here, which brought this critical mistake to light,\" he said in a statement. ABC News\\' Mark Osborne and Ben Siegel contributed to this report.\\nU.S. President Joe Biden\\'s administration is nearing a final plan to expel many of the thousands of Haitian migrants who have suddenly crossed into a Texas border city from Mexico and to fly them back to their Caribbean homeland DEL RIO, Texas -- Haitian migrants seeking to escape poverty, hunger and a feeling of hopelessness in their home country said they will not be deterred by U.S. plans to speedily send them back, as thousands of people remained encamped on the Texas border Saturday after crossing from Mexico. Scores of people waded back and forth across the Rio Grande on Saturday afternoon, re-entering Mexico to purchase water, food and diapers in Ciudad Acuna before returning to the Texas encampment under and near a bridge in the border city of Del Rio. Junior Jean, a 32-year-old man from Haiti, watched as people cautiously carried cases of water or bags of food through the knee-high river water. Jean said he lived on the streets in Chile the past four years, resigned to searching for food in garbage cans. \"We are all looking for a better life,\" he said. The Department of Homeland Security said Saturday that it moved about 2,000 of the migrants from the camp to other locations Friday for processing and possible removal from the U.S. Its statement also said it would have 400 agents and officers in the area by Monday morning and would send more if necessary. The announcement marked a swift response to the sudden arrival of Haitians in Del Rio, a Texas city of about 35,000 people roughly 145 miles (230 kilometers) west of San Antonio. It sits on a relatively remote stretch of border that lacks capacity to hold and process such large numbers of people. A U.S. official told The Associated Press on Friday that the U.S would likely fly the migrants out of the country on five to eight flights a day, starting Sunday, while another official expected no more than two a day and said everyone would be tested for COVID-19. The first official said operational capacity and Haitis willingness to accept flights would determine how many flights there would be. Both officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Told of the U.S. plans Saturday, several migrants said they still intended to remain in the encampment and seek asylum. Some spoke of the most recent devastating earthquake in Haiti and the assassination of President Jovenel Moise, saying they were afraid to return to a country that seems more unstable than when they left. \"In Haiti, there is no security,\" said Fabricio Jean, a 38-year-old Haitian who arrived with his wife and two daughters. \"The country is in a political crisis.\" Haitians have been migrating to the U.S. in large numbers from South America for several years, many having left their Caribbean nation after a devastating 2010 earthquake. After jobs dried up from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, many made the dangerous trek by foot, bus and car to the U.S. border, including through the infamous Darien Gap, a Panamanian jungle. Jorge Luis Mora Castillo, a 48-year-old from Cuba, said he arrived Saturday in Acuna and also planned to cross into the U.S. Castillo said his family paid smugglers $12,000 to take him, his wife and their son out of Paraguay, a South American nation where they had lived for four years. Told of the U.S. message discouraging migrants, Castillo said he wouldn\\'t change his mind. \"Because to go back to Cuba is to die,\" he said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection closed off vehicle and pedestrian traffic in both directions Friday at the only border crossing between Del Rio and Ciudad Acuna \"to respond to urgent safety and security needs\" and it remained closed Saturday. Travelers were being directed indefinitely to a crossing in Eagle Pass, roughly 55 miles (90 kilometers) away. Crowd estimates varied, but Del Rio Mayor Bruno Lozano said Saturday evening there were 14,534 immigrants at the camp under the bridge. Migrants pitched tents and built makeshif t shelters from giant reeds known as carrizo cane. Many bathed and washed clothing in the river. It is unclear how such a large number amassed so quickly, though many Haitians have been assembling in camps on the Mexican side of the border to wait while deciding whether to attempt entry into the U.S. The number of Haitian arrivals began to reach unsustainable levels for the Border Patrol in Del Rio about 2  1/2  weeks ago, prompting the agencys acting sector chief, Robert Garcia, to ask headquarters for help, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Since then, the agency has transferred Haitians in buses and vans to other Border Patrol facilities in Texas, specifically El Paso, Laredo and Rio Grande Valley. They are mostly processed outside of the pandemic-related authority, meaning they can claim asylum and remain in the U.S. while their claims are considered. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement makes custody decision but families can generally not be held more than 20 days under court order. Homeland Securitys plan announced Saturday signals a shift to use of pandemic-related authority for immediate expulsion to Haiti without an opportunity to claim asylum, the official said. The flight plan, while potentially massive in scale, hinges on how Haitians respond. They might have to decide whether to stay put at the risk of being sent back to an impoverished homeland wracked by poverty and political instability or return to Mexico. Unaccompanied children are exempt from fast-track expulsions. DHS said, \"our borders are not open, and people should not make the dangerous journey.\" \"Individuals and families are subject to border restrictions, including expulsion,\" the agency wrote. \"Irregular migration poses a significant threat to the health and welfare of border communities and to the lives of migrants themselves, and should not be attempted.\" U.S. authorities are being severely tested after Democratic President Joe Biden quickly dismantled Trump administration policies that Biden considered cruel or inhumane, most notably one requiring asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while waiting for U.S. immigration court hearings. A pandemic-related order to immediately expel migrants without giving them the opportunity to seek asylum that was introduced in March 2020 remains in effect, but unaccompanied children and many families have been exempt. During his first month in office, Biden chose to exempt children traveling alone on humanitarian grounds. Nicole Phillips, legal director for advocacy group Haitian Bridge Alliance, said Saturday that the U.S. government should process migrants and allow them to apply for asylum, not rush to expel them. \"It really is a humanitarian crisis,\" Phillips said. \"There needs to be a lot of help there now.\" Mexico\\'s immigration agency said in a statement Saturday that Mexico has opened a \"permanent dialogue\" with Haitian government representatives \"to address the situation of irregular migratory flows during their entry and transit through Mexico, as well as their assisted return.\" The agency didn\\'t specify if it was referring to the Haitians in Ciudad Acuna or to the thousands of others in Tapachula, at the Guatemalan border, and the agency didn\\'t immediately reply to a request for further details. In August, U.S. authorities stopped migrants nearly 209,000 times at the border, which was close to a 20-year high even though many of the stops involved repeat crossers because there are no legal consequences for being expelled under the pandemic authority. ------ Lozano reported from Ciudad Acuna, Mexico and Spagat reported from San Diego. Associated Press writers Ben Fox, Alexandra Jaffe and Colleen Long in Washington contributed to this report.\\nDespite the persistent pleas by public health officials to get vaccinated as coronavirus infections continue to surge, a staggeringly low number of pregnant people have been vaccinated against the virus nationwide. Just 25% of pregnant people in the United States between the ages of 18 and 49 are currently vaccinated with at least one dose, according to data through Sept. 11 compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The decision to not get vaccinated has resulted in a growing number of pregnant people ending up in intensive care wards, many severely ill with COVID-19. This worrisome uptick has been particularly evident in Mississippi, where state health officials have been sounding the alarm not only about the influx of fetal and maternal deaths, but also about several reports of pregnant women being turned away from getting the shot. \"Some of the patients had reported to us that they had gone to be vaccinated, and were turned away because they were pregnant. Those were people who were just sharing their experiences at pharmacies and other areas around the state,\" Dr. Michelle Owens, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at University of Mississippi Medical Center, told ABC News. Owens, alongside other state health officials, reported this week that not all of their patients had been vaccine-hesitant, but instead were turned down after disclosing that they were expecting. \"People are kind of adverse to pregnant patients when they come in. They\\'re hesitant to give pregnant patients medications, and certainly, vaccinations kind of fall into that,\" said Dr. Marty Tucker, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at UMMC, during a press conference on Thursday. In light of the concerning reports, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs issued a standing order last week for women to receive COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy, \"to give the pharmacy some reassurance for the places that it\\'s OK and recommended for pregnant women to get immunized at any stage in pregnancy.\" Owens added that health officials and physicians were all working together \"to help reduce barriers to vaccination for pregnant women, and we just really tried to amplify this information so that wherever a pregnant person goes in order to receive care or to receive a vaccine that they are welcomed with open arms and that they receive that vaccine.\" In Mississippi, 72 patients have experienced late pregnancy loss and 15 pregnant women have succumbed to the virus, more than half of whom have died since the end of July. None of the pregnant women who died was fully vaccinated, and the majority were overweight, according to Dobbs. \"There are NICUs all over this country that are filling up with babies who will not get to know their moms, and that\\'s devastating. There are families who are losing their matriarchs, and then, there are women who have been infected by this virus who won\\'t ever be the same,\" Owens said. Since the onset of the pandemic, more than 21,000 pregnant people have been hospitalized nationwide, and at least 155 have died as result of COVID-19, according to federal data. Additionally, there have been at least 266 pregnancy losses nationwide, and approximately 10.3% of patients have had to deliver prematurely. \"When we lose a mom, especially something that could be prevented, it is a tragedy. It does not discriminate, we see it in people with and without co-morbidities. We see it in people as young as 23 years old, so it is a bad actor across the board,\" Tucker said. Earlier in the pandemic, pregnant women at UMMC were not becoming as severely ill with COVID-19, but following the spread of the delta variant, Owens said, it became evident patients were becoming severely ill and deteriorating more quickly. \"We are seeing women, who may not have other co-morbid conditions, being affected at an earlier gestational age. Most of the people who we\\'re seeing now, are affected in the middle of their pregnancy, and they have a much more aggressive form of the disease,\" Owens said. \"The next thing you know, they end up progressing very quickly to need intubation.\" Pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 when compared to non-pregnant people, according to the CDC. In addition, they are also at increased risk for preterm birth and other poor pregnancy outcomes. The CDC and other leading health organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, have issued guidelines calling on all pregnant people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. \"CDC encourages all pregnant people or people who are thinking about becoming pregnant and those breastfeeding to get vaccinated to protect themselves from COVID-19,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement about the updated guidance last month. \"The vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible Delta variant and see severe outcomes from COVID-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people.\" The updated guidance from the CDC was based on further research that found pregnant people can receive an mRNA vaccine with no increased risk to themselves or their babies. \"[It] is really the most important thing to give pregnant women an opportunity to still be able to live to fight another day,\" Owens said. \"It\\'s really imperative that women get the good information to know that the COVID vaccine is safe, approved and recommended, and that it makes a big difference in whether or not a patient has severe disease, or potentially, could die.\"\\nWASHINGTON -- It was an hour President Joe Biden would no doubt like to forget. On Friday, the Pentagon acknowledged that a drone strike in Afghanistan killed 10 civilians, including seven children, not terrorists. A panel advising the Food and Drug Administration voted to not recommend COVID-19 booster shots for all Americans over age 16, dashing an administration hope. And France announced it was recalling its ambassador to the United States out of anger for being cut out of a secret nuclear submarine deal Biden had struck with the United Kingdom and Australia. The headlines, all within an hour, underscored the perils for any president from situations that can define a term in office. Already, Biden has seen public approval numbers trend downward as the pandemic has deepened and Americans cast blame for the flawed U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The administration had hoped to roll out tougher vaccine guidelines, a new international alliance to thwart China and a recommitment to what Biden has done best: drawing on his years on Capitol Hill and knowledge of the legislative process to cajole fellow Democrats to pass the two far-reaching spending bills that make up the heart of his agenda. Those ambitions are now more difficult to achieve. Biden has proclaimed defeating the pandemic to be the central mission of his presidency. But the United States is now averaging more than 145,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases per day, compared with a low of about 8,500 per day three months ago. The president has tried to shift the blame for the resurgence of cases to the more than 70 million Americans who have not gotten a vaccine and the GOP lawmakers who have opposed his increasingly forceful efforts to push people to get a shot. Aides had hoped for full FDA approval for the boosters, yet the advisory panel only recommended them for those over age 65 or with underlying health conditions or special circumstances. Biden aides in recent days had quietly expressed relief that the Afghanistan withdrawal -- like the war itself for much of its nearly two decades -- has receded from headlines. That feeling was shattered Friday afternoon when the Pentagon revealed the errant target for what was believed to be the final American drone strike of the war. Biden had long advocated leaving Afghanistan. Even after a suicide bombing killed 13 American service members, he told advisers the withdrawal decision was correct. He is known for his certitude, a stubbornness that flashed when he dismissed suggestions that he express regret for how the withdrawal occurred. Aides have since been quick to note that more than 120,000 people have been successfully evacuated and they say U.S. efforts are securing the steady departure of others from under Taliban rule. The end in Afghanistan was part of an effort to refocus foreign policy on China, an aim that accelerated with the surprise announcement of the agreement between the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. But not only did Beijing balk, so did Paris, as France angrily accused the U.S. of cutting France out of the alliance and scuttling its own submarine deal with Australia. And then France recalled its ambassador after its officials expressed dismay that, in their estimation, Biden had proven to be as unreliable a partner as his predecessor Donald Trump. The strain with France came just as Biden had hoped to pivot to his ambitious domestic agenda. But there are ideological divides among the Democrats on Capitol Hill about the $3.5 trillion spending package meant to be passed in tandem with the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. And all of Congress will be forced to juggle the White Houses legislation while being swamped with imminent deadlines on the debt ceiling and government funding. The West Wing is re-creating a legislative strategy that worked to secure passage of the $1.9 trillion COVID relief in March and pushed the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill through the Senate in August, according to a half dozen White House aides and outside advisers who were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity. With Biden cajoling lawmakers, the infrastructure bill is to be passed through the House along with the $3.5 trillion spending bill that contains many of the presidents priorities, such as like climate change and child care, and would pass the Senate along party lines. Because the Senate is in a 50-50 tie and Democrats margin in the House is only a handful of seats, few votes can be lost. It could be a formidable task to unite Democratic moderates such as Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who want a far smaller spending bill, with liberals including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has steadfastly said it could not shrink. The White House also has begun filling the presidents schedule again with events meant to highlight the need to pass the bills, including linking visits to the sites of natural disasters -- fires in California and Idaho, hurricane damage in Louisiana and the Northeast -- to the climate change funding in the legislation. This past Thursday, on what had previously been tentatively planned as a down day for Biden, the White House scheduled him to give a speech from the East Room during which he zeroed in on how tax enforcement to get big corporations and wealthy Americans to pay more would help fund his plan, without offering any new details. But there are roadblocks. Manchin told Biden that he could not support $3.5 trillion and White House aides have begun signaling that they would settle for a smaller package, even if it raises the ire of progressives. Bidens advisers believe that, even if there is some unhappiness with the package, no Democratic lawmaker would want to be perceived as undermining the centerpiece of the agenda of a president from their own party. The White House is also scaling back the presidents travel so he can support the agenda on Capitol Hill, but its led to concerns among some Democratic lawmakers that Biden isn\\'t doing enough to personally sell the legislation to their constituents across the country. Some aides worry about the exposure level Biden may have faced when he mingled in groups during a recent trip to the West and his three stops to mark the Sept. 11 anniversary, two officials said. Biden, 78, also did not get a summer vacation. His plan to spend time at his Delaware home in August was scuttled by the Afghanistan crisis. Aides had finally scheduled him a break, a long weekend at his house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.. He reached his home Friday just after 1:30 p.m. Ninety minutes later, any hope for a quiet weekend vanished.\\nBefore 1973, fatal \"back-alley\" and \"coat-hanger\" procedures in places where abortion was illegal became emblematic of the impact of abortion bans. But in modern times, those images have become obsolete with the use of medication abortion, advocates say. This has become especially relevant in light of Texas\\' new abortion law that bans the procedure as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, making it inaccessible for many across the state. \"An abortion road trip is a thing of the past,\" said Elisa Wells, co-founder and co-director of Plan C, an abortion research and pro-abortion rights advocacy group. \"We have safe and effective medical technology in the form of abortion pills and online access to care that can deliver it directly to your doorstep. This is the 21st century and everybody deserves the same access to care that we have through mainstream medical channels.\" In a medication abortion, patients take two pills: mifepristone, which stops the production of progesterone, and misoprostol, which causes the abortion. Without progesterone, uterine lining breaks down and a pregnancy is prevented from continuing, according to Planned Parenthood. The regimen is approved by the FDA to end pregnancies up to  10 weeks. Mifepristone is only supplied to health care providers who meet certain qualifications and is recommended by the FDA to be taken by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber to ensure safe use. But, advocates say, people still seek abortions when governments restrict access to the procedures, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research organization. With no other options for a legal abortion, some feel forced into unsupervised or illegal tactics to obtain one -- which could include obtaining medication through methods like utilizing a telehealth appointment with a provider in a state where it is legal, having pills mailed via international organizations on the internet, or crossing the border to Mexico, where misoprostol is sold in pharmacies as an ulcer medication. Safety concerns Medication abortion with both mifepristone and misoprostol is effective more than 95% of the time, according to the Guttmacher Institute. A 2013 study of 47,283 subjects found 0.3% were hospitalized for complications, such as vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or infection. In medical settings where it is legal, doctors say it is safe for patients to take the pills and have an abortion at home. For example, some Planned Parenthood locations have begun offering at-home services via telehealth where that is legal. A recent study by Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California San Francisco, found evidence that medication abortion care administered online via telehealth providers is feasible and safe. Still, there are some medical concerns about obtaining pills to self-manage an abortion outside of doctors\\' guidance. International pills haven\\'t been checked by U.S. authorities for quality, and people who acquire misoprostol on their own may not know the right dosages without the guidance of a clinician. Misoprostol, which is sold across the border without mifepristone, is 85% successful in inducing abortion in the first trimester on its own, according to the International Women\\'s Health Coalition. A 2019 research article in the Obstetrics & Gynecology journal found that misoprostol alone is an effective, safe option for people seeking an abortion in their first trimester. Overall, however, advocates say the risk level is low. \"It (may not be) legally safe, but it is medically safe. And I think that accessing these medications in an unregulated way may be the only recourse for many people, the only way to have reproductive autonomy,\" Upadhyay told ABC News. Legal questions While studies indicate medical concerns are relatively limited, there are legal questions about accessing medication abortion. International providers who operate on the internet, for example, often skirt around local legislation restricting abortion access. Thirty-four states only allow physicians to help patients obtain medication abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Nineteen states require physicians be physically present with the patient, which essentially bans the use of telemedicine to prescribe the medication. Meanwhile, the new Texas law, which the Supreme Court allowed to go into effect but is being legally challenged, authorizes private citizens to bring civil suits against anyone who \"aids or abets\" an abortion -- but not the patient themself. With that, it\\'s unclear how lawsuits against online providers would fare in Texas -- but the law implies that doctors from out of state, online providers or people who drive others to get an abortion may be at risk if a fetal heartbeat had been detected and known at the time of the abortion. \"If an individual were to get an abortion, that individual would not be penalized, but everyone who was involved in that patient\\'s care would be at risk of getting sued by someone who\\'s part of the anti-abortion movement,\" said Dr. Meera Shah, the chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic. Restricted access Self-managed abortion has been pushed into the spotlight by the Texas law, which is the most restrictive abortion ban to go into effect in decades. \"This is driving patients into a panic,\" said Shah. \"Our health centers in Texas are getting inundated with phone calls from patients, trying to figure out where they can get care or how they can get care.\" Before the Texas ban directly restricted access to abortion, other states had made it difficult for abortion clinics to remain open, forcing anyone in search of an in-clinic procedure or an in-person physician consultation to travel long distances for an available provider. Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), a research group at the University of California, San Francisco\\'s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health found that there are at least 27 \"abortion deserts\" in the country -- cities with populations of over 100,000 where residents must travel more than 100 miles to reach a clinic. ANSIRH has also found that denying people an abortion can cause economic hardship and insecurity. People denied an abortion are more likely to stay with a violent or abusive partner and are more likely to raise the child alone. \"What\\'s so important is to focus on people who are the most underserved: those are the people who won\\'t know about Aid Access, won\\'t be able to travel, low income populations and immigrant populations, people with limited English proficiency,\" Upadhyay said. \"These are the people that are going to end up having to carry to term because they just have no other choice,\" she added.\\nWalt Disney once famously said \"You can dream, create, design and build the most wonderful place in the world...but it takes people to make the dream a reality.\" As we prepare to celebrate 50 magical years of Walt Disney World Resort, were also celebrating the role our cast members have played in carrying on the legacy of Walt Disney World for five decades and counting.

Our Transportation casts role is one rich in heritage. This year we not only celebrate 50 years of Walt Disney World, we celebrate 50 years of Disney Transportation and its legacy, dating back to the innovative mind of Walt Disney himself. To commemorate this milestone, Transportation cast members across Walt Disney World were amongst the first to get to see the new 50th anniversary bus, Disney Skyliner gondola and monorail wraps. Their reactions to these surprises were heartwarming to say the least. Transportation Maintenance Mechanic Roderick said that working on the monorails is something he never thought hed be doing. \"Its been a real enjoyment in my life. Now seeing the new wraps out of our workshop and ready for guests -- its a big privilege.\" At Disney Skyliner, the 50th-themed gondola wrap will be the first addition cast members have seen since Disney Skyliner opened in 2019. \"It is always fun to help guests pick out their favorite gondola,\" Disney Skyliner Host Alexandra said. \"I know which one Ill be showing them!\" \"Im so excited to be a magical bus driver during the 50th celebration,\" Stacy said. \"Im most looking forward to picking up not just our guests, but our fellow cast members in the new EARidescent bus.\" Whether arriving by boat, bus, monorail or gondola, Transportation cast members have always been one of the first teams guests see before even stepping foot in a theme park. It is with that sentiment that we celebrate these cast members today and every day for their commitment to making the magic move. Head to the @WDW.Ambassador Instagram to watch these cast members candid reactions to the Walt Disney World 50th anniversary transportation wraps being revealed.\\nWe are so excited to introduce to you our new friend of Duffy, LinaBell. She is a fox with an inquisitive mind and the intelligence that supports it. She finds joy and excitement in solving problems and mysteries. Duffy met LinaBell when he was lost in the forest following a butterfly. LinaBell suddenly but masterfully took out her magnifying glass and started examining \"clues\" on Duffys body to figure out where he had come from. Thanks to her detective-like talent, Duffy was able to be reunited with Mickey Mouse. Duffy and the rest of the friends are often in awe of her ingenious ways of solving problems. LinaBell teaches all of us to look around for clues. You never know; clues to our problems might be right in front of our eyes, and we just dont know it! Now that LinaBell has joined the family, you can look forward to more exciting and heartwarming tales in the story world of Duffy and Friends!

It certainly was a day filled with emotions and tears of joy were shed! After several weeks full of excitement and suspense, the word is out: Carmen Lleo Badal (Contact Center) and Quentin Rodrigues (Show & Ride Engineering) will have the honor of representing Disneyland Paris in 2022 and beyond. Their tenure promises to be full of exceptional moments, including the celebration of our Resorts 30th Anniversary. Im so proud of them as they worked their way through our selection process completing several interviews with cast members from different divisions and showed their skills through a range of tests on public speaking, social media content creation and community engagement. Carmen, originally from Spain, joined the company in 2011 and gained experience in different roles, first in Food & Beverage and later as an Attraction Hostess. After expanding her knowledge in event management in the United States, Carmen returned to Disneyland Paris and joined the digital team of our Contact Center, where she assists guests for upcoming stays to make sure they have the most magical time with us! Her love for Disneyland Paris comes from her family, as theyve been life-long guests of the Resort. Even her brother joins our big family of cast members on a regular basis for the high season! Quentin holds a dual degree in Engineering, part of which he completed at the University of California, Berkeley. Just like Carmen, Quentin has international experience as he joined Walt Disney World Resort as an Attraction Host at Peter Pans Flight in 2015, before joining Disneyland Paris in 2018 on the Show & Ride Engineering team. Daily he ensures our guests enjoy our attractions to their fullest and guess what: he has become the engineer in charge of... Peter Pans Flight! Talk about a full circle! They look forward to representing the many talents of our cast members, highlighting our different roles, talents and creativity. I could not be more excited to start their training in the upcoming months, see them grow and become fabulous Ambassadors! Youll make us proud Carmen and Quentin! Stay tuned on @DLPAmbassador on Instagram and Facebook to follow Carmen and Quentins first steps in this extraordinary adventure!\\nIn my first role at Walt Disney World, my office was above what is now Tonys Town Square Restaurant, in Magic Kingdom. During breaks, my leader and I would walk on Main Street, U.S.A. and he would point out the windows advertising the owners of fictitious businesses--everything from music schools and detective agencies to modeling agencies and fence painters. The businesses are fictitious, but their owners are real; exceptional individuals who helped shape the legacy of Walt Disney World. A \"window on Main Street\" has long been, and still is, our ultimate compliment to such exceptional cast members. We confer new windows very rarely. Yet, on September 12, we dedicated a window to a Disney leader beloved on three continents--and one that we at Walt Disney World still cherish as \"one of our own.\" Just like me, George A. Kalogridis grew up in Winter Haven, FL. He started with Disney in September of 1971 as a busser at the Disneys Contemporary Resort. He was pretty sure it would just be temporary employment--something with which to work his way through college. Half a century later, he is still with Disney. His leadership roles, which include presidencies at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort, have all been within what is now the Disney Parks, Experiences and Products segment. George has had a hand in many things during his career, like the creation of Disney Pin Trading, and the memorable \"Frozen Summer Fun\" at Disneys Hollywood Studios. He led the resort during a period of remarkable growth and opened Pandora--The World of Avatar, Toy Story Land and Star Wars: Galaxys Edge; experiences which have become staples of a Walt Disney World vacation. Today, in addition to being president of Segment Development and Enrichment, George is also Global Ambassador for the 50th anniversary of our resort. These accomplishments have been nothing short of legendary, and now theres a special spot in the Magic Kingdom that pays tribute to the person behind them. Next time youre at the Magic Kingdom, I hope youll slow down and look at the windows on Main Street, U.S.A. Not just Georges, but all of them. The extraordinary contributions of the people on those windows are part of what makes Walt Disney World Resort \"The Most Magical Place on Earth.\"\\nWelcoming home those brave military personnel who have been serving overseas in defense of our nations freedoms is a time-honored and highly anticipated event. Walt Disney World Resort cast members upheld this tradition by giving a heros welcome to a Disneys Yacht Club Resort cast member who recently returned home from a six-month deployment to the Middle East. Gil Mercado, a 22-year-old culinary specialist at the Yacht Club, recently completed a second tour of duty in Afghanistan with the U.S. Army Reserves. On his first week back in the United States, Gil visited the resort to enjoy the Disney Magic he missed while serving far from home. He was warmly greeted by Walt Disney World executives and his fellow cast members, including members of Disneys SALUTE veteran group to officially welcoming him home. \"Our cast family was so happy to welcome Gil home to Walt Disney World,\" said Kim Marinaccio, General Manager, Disneys Yacht and Beach Club Resorts. \"I grew up in a military household, so being able to welcome this brave Soldier and Disney cast member home and thank him for his service was special to me. In fact, it was the highlight of my 31-year career with Disney.\" During his deployment, Gil shared that he never lost sight that he was a Disney cast member and tried to share magic when he was able with those in his Army unit and those they interacted in the remote terrain. \"As a cast member, we learn that our goal is to create happiness and try to make magic anywhere you are,\" said Gil. \"Before I deployed, I packed a roll of Mickey stickers in my bag, which I was able to share with local children as our unit traveled. Seeing the smiles on the kids faces was priceless.\" The young soldier, who is about to test for his sergeants stripes, also reported that the meal he missed the most while deployed was a steak. So, Kim and SALUTE hosted him with a welcome-home breakfast at his home restaurant: Ale and Compass. And when the chefs learned who it was that they were serving, they supplemented his breakfast with the largest butchers-cut steak in their kitchen. Gil happily ate every bite. Gil with members of the Disney SALUTE Veteran Business Employer Resource Group The proud soldier is still serving on active duty while on military leave from Disney. He looks forward to returning to his role at Walt Disney World after the turn of the year and said he was grateful for, and enjoyed, his few hours of homecoming. \"I am proud to be out there serving in military uniform and appreciate Disneys support while Im away serving my country,\" said Gil. \"Its funny what you find yourself missing most when living in challenging conditions on deployment. I really missed walking barefoot in the grass, feeling the rain and walking around Disney parks. Im glad to be able to do all three this week!\" We salute Gil and all the military personnel who continue serving in our nations armed forces around the world.\\nAs part of the global Ultimate Princess Celebration, last months inaugural World Princess Week illuminated courage and kindness through a weeklong extravaganza filled with events, experiences, products and more. To join the fun, Disneyland Paris collaborated with influencers from across the region to embody the confidence and courage of Disney Princesses and \"Frozen\" queens and create a photoshoot capturing the essence of each hero through Disney bounding. For those unfamiliar, Disney bounding pays homage to our favorite characters through an interpretive fashion lens, recreating iconic looks rather than modernizing who the character is or what they look like. Photographed: La fille qui a des taches (left); Cerise Calixte (right) Disneyland Paris incorporated the mystique of a \"flying dress\" to produce the magical Disney bounding moment. Each participant was asked to choose the Disney Princess or \"Frozen\" queen they most identified with, in terms of qualities and values, and the Disneyland Paris team worked to create a scene and look that best exemplified the vision. Photographed: Laila Mourad (left); Michael Augusto (right) The women and men included in this photoshoot all express admirable strength and courage through their own platforms, whether it is not letting themselves be defined by a disability, overcoming personal obstacles, expressing self-love and body confidence, or being an ambassador of positivity. Photographed: Amput Girl (left); This is Venice (right) Photographed: The other art of living (left); Gioia Parijs (right) Photographed: The Ginger Chloe (right); ElsaMakeUp (right) The timeless characters demonstrate the multiple and diverse ways to be a Disney Princess and this photoshoot showcases how people of all backgrounds can experience the magic of these characters.\\n\"It has brought us to the breaking point,\" one hospital official said. In January, Alaska had the highest per capita coronavirus vaccination rate in the nation. Now, hospitals are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, and the states largest hospital is rationing care. Vaccine hesitancy and the delta variant have pushed the states fragile and limited hospital system to the breaking point. Providence Alaska Medical Center, the states largest hospital, released a letter to the public Tuesday saying that more than 30% of its patients have COVID-19 and the hospital is rationing treatment. \"While we are doing our utmost, we are no longer able to provide the standard of care to each and every patient who needs our help,\" wrote Chief of Staff Kristen Solana Walkinshaw on behalf of the hospitals Medical Executive Committee. \"The acuity and number of patients now exceeds our resources and our ability to staff beds with skilled caregivers, like nurses and respiratory therapists.\" Of Alaska\\'s 120 ICU beds, 106 were filled as of Thursday -- leaving only 14 beds available statewide. Alaska had a strong initial vaccine rollout, delivering doses to remote areas of the state by helicopters, planes, dog sleds and ferries, with additional support from the Indian Health Service and state tribal health system to vaccinate Alaska Natives. Due to the challenges posed by the states vast size, it received vaccine allocations monthly as opposed to weekly, giving it the ability to plan ahead and deliver many doses early on. But, as in the rest of the country, vaccination rates slowly began dropping off over the summer, stagnating with 56.7% of Alaskans fully vaccinated as of Thursday, according to the states coronavirus dashboard. \"In terms of why things went stagnant, it does seem like hesitancy is the main factor behind that,\" said Jared Kosin, CEO and president of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association. \"It\\'s not an access issue. The vaccine\\'s widely available in Alaska anywhere.\" Gov. Mike Dunleavy ended Alaskas COVID-19 emergency declaration in the spring, and both the state legislature and Dunleavys administration have yet to reinstate one even at the pleading of hospitals and doctors. In a spring mayoral race, Anchorage voters elected Dave Bronson, who has repeatedly said his administration will not enact citywide mask or vaccine mandates. Bronson reiterated that commitment on Tuesday after an assembly meeting where hospital workers begged for action. Cases in Alaska have been sharply increasing since August, and the state shattered its new daily case record with 1,068 infections reported Wednesday. As a result, hospitalizations have skyrocketed, reaching all time highs. And health care experts warn this is only the beginning of a surge that could last weeks. \"It has brought us to the breaking point, and to be totally direct, in many respects we are broken,\" said Kosin. \"The situation is extremely bleak.\" Alaska runs on a \"hub-and-spoke model\" of health care, according to Kosin. \"If you\\'re in a more rural area, you\\'re going to go to clinics, rural hospitals,\" he told ABC News. \"The idea is, as you need a higher level of care or (have) more needs, you will transfer in, ultimately, to our biggest hub, which is Anchorage.\" Anchorage, the states most populous city, is home to the states three largest hospitals -- some of which offer the only advanced neurological and cardiovascular care in the state. While many people live in rural and geographically isolated areas, those communities still rely on the specialty medical care that can only be found in the city. As city hospitals have reached capacity and Anchorage residents are forced to remain in their cars or emergency room waiting areas until they can receive care, health care institutions must refuse transfer patients from rural communities, leaving them without what can be lifesaving treatment, Solana Walkinshaw said. The nearest next option are hospitals in the contiguous U.S. like Seattle, Washington -- an over three-hour flight away. Seattle is also experiencing an influx of COVID-19 patients and is trying to help by taking patients from neighboring states like Idaho, which is coping with its most serious surge in cases since the beginning of the pandemic. That leaves very limited options. Because city hospitals are inundated with COVID-19 cases, they are struggling to provide routine care and emergency services to patients who do not have the virus. As of Tuesday night, Providence Alaska Medical Center had only a single available bed with 10 admitted patients in need of one, along with patients in the emergency room also waiting for an opening, Solana Walkinshaw said. Three of those patients needed an ICU bed, but the hospital had none available. Between 80-85% of COVID-19 patients at the hospital are unvaccinated and the same is true of the COVID-19 patients who die, according to Providence Alaska Medical Center spokesperson Mikal Canfield. The hospital began rationing care Saturday, leaving health care workers to decide which patients get care and which ones have to wait. The staff is demoralized, Solana Walkinshaw said, with some breaking down in tears, sad and frustrated over the situation they find themselves in. \"People are struggling, working as hard as they can and having to make these decisions is probably some of the hardest things people have done in their careers,\" she said. While rural Alaska has experienced a stark increase in coronavirus cases, with some communities seeing the worst outbreaks on record, rural health providers are not being hit as hard with COVID-19 patients, Kosin said. That\\'s due to the smaller populations outside of the city, the fact that the COVID-19 patients in the most serious condition are sent to Anchorage and because some of the villages have very high vaccination rates. The bigger problem for rural institutions is that they are being tasked with caring for non-COVID-19 patients they would typically transfer to Anchorage. At Tuesday\\'s city assembly meeting, a group of health care workers from hospitals across Anchorage pleaded for residents to wear masks and get vaccinated. Leslie Gonsette, an internal medicine hospitalist at Providence Alaska Medical Center, came to testify at the meeting during her hospital shift. One of her patients, who does not have COVID-19 and is vaccinated, was in critical condition and in need of an ICU bed, she said. \"I called my colleagues in the ICU, and I explained, \\'My patient is going to probably die. I need an ICU bed,\\'\" she said. \"And the answer I got was, \\'We are doing our best. We do not have a bed.\\'\" Bronsons office released a statement after the meeting. \"My administration has been clear since the beginning that we will not mandate masks or vaccines,\" it said. \"If someone wants to wear a mask or get a vaccination that\\'s their personal choice. But we will not violate the privacy and independent health care decisions of our citizens in the process.\" Alaska\\'s health care providers, however, are left worrying about the kinds of choices they will be left with. \"Rationing care will take on a whole new meaning than it does today,\" Kosin said. \"I think it\\'s going to lead to the types of decisions you cant imagine a person having to make.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the Food and Drug Administration\\'s vaccine advisory panel rejected a plan on Friday to offer Pfizer COVID-19 booster shots to all vaccinated adults 16 and over, White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci defended the White House\\'s earlier plan to begin rolling out the shots to the general population this month. \"The approval was for people 65 years of age or older, and a considerable number of people who are 18 to 64 who have underlying conditions that put them at a higher risk for severe disease, and people from 18 to 64 who are in institutional or occupational situations that would put them at an increased risk to exposure and infection,\" Fauci said Sunday. \"So that\\'s a pretty good chunk of the people.\" Fauci told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that he was not disappointed by the panel\\'s decision to recommend that extra Pfizer shots should be given only to those 65 and older or those at high risk of severe COVID-19 and he thinks the process worked. \"We would hope that ultimately when we get the proper vaccination to everyone or we get a more extensive distribution of the boosters, that it will have an effect of stopping the spread, but the -- but the goal of this particular decision was to prevent people from getting serious disease who are at risk, such as the elderly and those that have underlying conditions,\" Fauci said. \"Ultimately, Martha, we hope that enough people will be vaccinated either with the primary regimen or following a third-shot booster with Pfizer that we will get that effect of preventing spread.\" The panel also said it supports giving boosters to health care and other front-line workers, including teachers. A final decision is expected within days. Raddatz pressed Fauci on whether the White House\\'s premature announcement that they would begin rolling out shots to the general population this month created any confusion. \"You yourself have said how important consistency and messaging can be, and you mentioned earlier, President Biden talked about planning for a September 20th rollout for all Americans. I know he said \\'planning,\\' I know he said it depends on the FDA, but isn\\'t a timeline like that just confusing to people?\" Raddatz asked. \"These are the kinds of things that when you make a decision, you don\\'t snap your finger and it gets rolled out the next day and that\\'s, I think, the thing that the people in the United States need to understand,\" he responded. \"The plan was that we have to be ready to do this as soon as the decision is made and when you have a plan, you put a date on it and you say we want to be able to get ready to roll out on the week of September the 20th,\" Fauci added. \"So giving that date, I don\\'t think was confusing. We needed a date to be able to say, let\\'s get ready to roll this out, pending the decision of the deliberation by the FDA and ultimately the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\" Fauci said on Sunday that in three to four weeks -- as more data from Israel and the U.S. emerge -- the FDA advisory panel will continue to reexamine and modify recommendations for boosters. \"The story is not over because more and more data is coming in and will be coming in,\" Fauci said. He also said data on potential booster shots from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines is only \"a couple of weeks away\" and that the information will be examined in the same manner as Pfizer\\'s data. COVID-19 cases in the U.S. continue to soar. The country has reported more than 1.02 million cases over the last week and the U.S. recorded more than 10,000 confirmed COVID-19 related deaths in one week, according to federal data. With many students back in the classroom in person, pediatric COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations remain at one of their highest points of the pandemic and Raddatz asked Fauci when a vaccine might be available for children. \"It will certainly be this fall,\" Fauci responded. \"What we\\'re going to almost certainly see is that sometime in the next few weeks -- as we get into October -- we\\'ll be able to see the vaccines for children get enough data to be presented for safety and immunogenicity.\" \"But in the fall, you know, rather than specifically saying what week, sometime in the mid- to late-fall, we will be seeing enough data from the children from 11 down to 5 to be able to make a decision to vaccinate them,\" Fauci added.\\nFormer Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said Sunday that U.S. Central Command Gen. Kenneth McKenzie\\'s acknowledgement that the Aug. 29 drone strike near the Kabul airport was \"a mistake\" was the correct response. \"I thought what Gen. McKenzie did was right,\" Mullen told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. Ten civilians were killed in the strike, which the U.S. believed was targeting a terrorist, but instead killed an aid worker, seven children and others in the area. \"We now assess that it is unlikely that the vehicle and those who died were associated with ISIS-Khorasan or were a direct threat to U.S. forces,\" McKenzie said Friday. \"I offer my profound condolences to the family and friends of those who were killed,\" he added. \"How can such a huge mistake happen?\" Raddatz asked the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \"We\\'ve done this for years ... we\\'ve had drone strikes that were very effective over many years and didn\\'t kill any civilians and we\\'ve also had drone strikes which did,\" Mullen said. He added that the over-the-horizon-capability -- or airstrikes that don\\'t require troops to be based in the country -- is there, but the strike\\'s execution being in a \"confused environment\" contributed to the difficulty of the situation. \"And should there be accountability for this?\" Raddatz asked Mullen. \"I absolutely think there should,\" Mullen responded. He also added that there should be accountability for the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, adding, \"I hope that there is.\" Separately, Mullen also spoke about the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley in light of revelations in Washington Post journalists, Bob Woodward and Robert Costa\\'s new book, \"Peril.\" According to the book, Milley secretly reached out to China\\'s military leaders in the waning months of Donald Trump\\'s presidency and assured them that Trump would not attack to stay in office. Mullen echoed other leaders who said that communicating \"with counterparts around the world is routine\" and he added that he was encouraged the line of communication with China remained open during the tumultuous time. \"There was a time when we had no communications with China, or we\\'d have a problem with China, they\\'d cut off all mil-to-mil connections,\" Mullen said. However, Mullen said that the reported assurance Milley gave to China that he would call them in the event of a strike, wasn\\'t routine, and on that point, he told Raddatz, \"Yes, well, I\\'m hopeful that actually -- that part of it isn\\'t true.\" Mullen said that he was more concerned China would be worried about a U.S. nuclear attack. \"It speaks to the need to have these open communications, so that we don\\'t miscalculate,\" he said. Milley reportedly went so far as to make sure he was alerted if Trump ever took steps to launch an attack on China. As a military adviser to the president, he\\'s otherwise outside of the chain of command. Mullen cited the extra precaution as \"fairly routine ... for something this serious.\" Mullen also said that he sympathized with the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \"I don\\'t know if anyone has been in a more difficult situation than Mark Milley,\" Mullen said. \"I know him well enough to know that he would really try to do the best thing for our country. And I think he did that.\"\\nVice President Kamala Harris will make her first talk show appearance in-studio since being sworn into office on \"The View.\" The Emmy award-winning daytime talk show is making history once again on Friday, Sept. 24, by welcoming the vice president onto the show for an exclusive interview. Co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg, Sara Haines, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Ana Navarro will discuss with Harris the latest on the COVID-19 pandemic, including vaccines, hesitancy, misinformation, boosters and the impact of the pandemic on women in the workforce, as well as issues surrounding Afghanistan, immigration and voting rights.

The White House on Monday announced a new international air travel system to start in early November that will ease travel restrictions from other countries but require all foreign nationals traveling to the United States to be fully vaccinated and test negative for coronavirus before boarding a U.S. bound plane -- a move that will allow families who have been separated by travel restrictions since March 2020 to reunite. The announcement came as President Joe Biden prepared to head to the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Monday and a day before he was to meet at the White House with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who reportedly was expected to call on Biden to ease travel restrictions. The new system will no longer block international travelers from individual countries, but instead apply the same rules to every country: entry to the US requires full vaccination and a negative test three days before traveling. \"This new system allows us to implement strict protocols to prevent the spread of COVID from passengers flying internationally into the United States by requiring adult foreign nationals traveling to the United States be fully vaccinated,\" said Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. \"This is based on individuals rather than a country-based approach, so it is a strong system.\" Once in the US, fully vaccinated international travelers will not be required to quarantine for 14 days, but the White House said it will be stepping up its contact tracing efforts by collecting contact information of U.S.-bound travelers and sharing it with state and local public health officials to alert travelers if they have become exposed to COVID-19. As for unvaccinated Americans, international travel will require more stringent requirements under the new plan. They will be required to have a negative test within one day of boarding a flight to the US and will be required to test again upon arriving. The current CDC guidelines for Americans traveling internationally, whether they are vaccinated or not, requires proof of a negative test three days before departure in order to enter the US. The new plan also involves continued mask wearing during air travel, a mandate that Biden extended to last until Jan. 18 last month. \"It\\'s simple: Masking help stop the spread of COVID-19. If you break the rules, be prepared for the consequences,\" Zients said. The specific vaccines that qualify a traveler as \"fully vaccinated\" will be determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Zients said, and the administration did not outline any vaccine requirements for domestic travel, though they said aren\\'t taking any options off the table. The administration hopes that Biden\\'s recent rule requiring federal workers and businesses to be vaccinated will be help increase vaccination rates in the U.S. \"We clearly have a track record that shows we\\'re pulling available levers to require vaccinations and we\\'re not taking any measures off the table on specific authorities used for implementation,\" Zients said.\\nTwo people are being treated for gunshot wounds following a shooting at Heritage High School in Newport News, Virginia, according to police. Their injuries are not considered life-threatening and a suspect was in custody later in the day, investigators said. Students at the high school were evacuated and sent to the tennis courts, according to the Newport News Police Department. Police said at 11:30 a.m., they responded to a shooting call at the school. \"Four, maybe five\" students were sent to area hospitals. Of those, two were being treated for gunshot wounds. The two unidentified gunshot victims are 17 years old. One male was shot in the face and a female was shot in the lower leg, police said at a press conference Monday afternoon. Another student is being treated after falling during the chaotic scene, while another was transported for breathing issues related to asthma, police said. Later in the afternoon, the Newport police said they had a person in custody, who they would only describe as \"a male juvenile.\" The investigation is ongoing. Police said they are going through footage and evidence recovered from the scene as they hunt for the suspect. Police officers said they don\\'t believe the suspect is a threat to other members of the community and it seems there was some type of altercation that led to the shooting, but they\\'re still investigating. An official with the FBI Field Office in Norfolk, Virginia, tells ABC News they are aware and providing assistance to local authorities. The ATF said it is also assisting.\\nTexas lawmakers alone have introduced more than 40 anti-trans bills this year. Texas legislators are heading into their third special session Monday with several controversial topics on the agenda, including transgender student participation in sports and gender-affirming health care for trans youth. Lawmakers will consider banning transgender students from playing on interscholastic teams that align with their gender identity. Children in grades K through 12 would only be allowed to play sports that correspond with their sex assigned at birth or sex designated on their original birth certificate. Texas lawmakers alone have introduced more than 40 anti-trans bills this year. At least 30 states across the country have introduced similar bills on trans student-athletes. So far, eight states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Tennessee, South Dakota and West Virginia -- have passed the bills into laws or signed them as executive orders. The laws are being challenged in Arkansas, Florida, Tennessee and West Virginia. Some groups in support of the bills, like the conservative Christian group Concerned Women for America, claim that trans girls have an unfair advantage. \"The issue is about the basic fairness and opportunities that women have fought for centuries to obtain,\" the group said in a statement to ABC News. \"The disparity comes when forcing women to compete against a biological male that has innate biological differences, giving them physical advantages that simply cannot be erased.\" There is no evidence that trans athletes disproportionately dominate sports when playing on teams that correspond with their gender identity. There is also no evidence that they have an advantage. Other anti-trans bills on the special session docket include bans on gender-affirming therapy, counseling, surgery or health care. In some cases, allowing a child or teen under the age of 18 gender-affirming health care may be considered child abuse, if HB22 is signed into law. LGBTQ+ advocates say these bills only serve to tarnish the mental health and safety of trans students. \"Like any other student, trans young people just want to stay healthy, go to school and spend time with their friends and loved ones,\" Andy Marra, the executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, told ABC News. \"For transgender students living in states where their very lives are under attack, it can be near impossible to focus on much else but surviving.\" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that discrimination can lead to poor mental health, suicide, substance abuse, violence and other health risks for trans youth. Young transgender students are also three times more likely to attempt suicide than their cisgender peers, the CDC reported.\\nNo unemployment benefits if fired for refusing vaccine in this state The New York State Department of Labor has issued guidance to clarify that workers who are fired for refusing to get vaccinated are not eligible for unemployment insurance unless they have a valid medical reason. That announcement came as part of a multi-layered plan released by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Saturday in preparation of the state\\'s vaccine deadline for health care workers and school employees to receive their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by Monday or face termination and to prevent resulting staff shortages in hospitals and health care facilities. Under her plan, New York would declare a state of emergency to increase the health care workforce including allowing health care professionals licensed in other states or countries, recent graduates and retirees to work in New York state. Other facets of the plan include deploying medically trained National Guard members and federal disaster medical teams to assist local health care providers. As of Sept. 22, 84% of all hospital employees in New York State were fully vaccinated, according to the press release. As of Sept. 23, 81% of staff at all adult care facilities and 77% of all staff at nursing home facilities in New York State were fully vaccinated. \"We are still in a battle against COVID to protect our loved ones, and we need to fight with every tool at our disposal,\" Hochul said. \"I am monitoring the staffing situation closely, and we have a plan to increase our health care workforce and help alleviate the burdens on our hospitals and other health care facilities. I commend all of the health care workers who have stepped up to get themselves vaccinated, and I urge all remaining health care workers who are unvaccinated to do so now so they can continue providing care.\" -ABC News\\' Ahmad Hemingway\\nThe announcement comes in the wake of a dire warning from a UN climate panel. Nearly 90 new companies -- including multinational corporate giant Procter & Gamble, tech behemoth HP and cloud-computing titan Salesforce -- have signed onto the Climate Pledge, an Amazon-backed initiative that asks firms to commit to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Organizers of the Climate Pledge announced Monday a total of 86 new signatories, bringing the total number of companies involved to 201. The new commitments come as the United Nations General Assembly kicks off in New York City, with climate change talks expected to take center stage among the high-profile meeting of world leaders. It also comes in the wake of a recent report from a U.N. panel -- that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called a \"code red for humanity\" -- warning of dire environmental consequences if immediate action is not taken to cut back greenhouse gas emissions. ASOS, Nespresso and Selfridges are among some of the other household names who joined the pledge Monday. Altogether, pledge signatories employ more than 7 million employees across 26 industries in 21 countries. \"I believe that now, more than ever, companies like Amazon have an obligation to lead the fight for our planet,\" Andy Jassy, Amazon\\'s CEO, said in a statement Monday. \"But, solving this challenge cannot be accomplished by one company; it requires all of us to act together, and its one of the reasons were so excited to announce that more than 200 businesses have joined us in signing The Climate Pledge -- a commitment to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement 10 years early,\" Jassy added. David S. Taylor, Procter & Gamble\\'s CEO and president, echoed Jassy\\'s sentiments in a separate statement, saying that addressing climate change effectively, \"requires collaboration across industries and credible science-based actions.\" \"P&G has made significant progress over the past decade and we know we must do more,\" Taylor added. \"The task ahead is urgent, difficult, and much bigger than any single company can solve alone. P&G is proud to join The Climate Pledge as we work together to preserve our shared home for generations to come.\" If all of the firms followed through on their promise, they would collectively mitigate some 1.98 billion metric tons of carbon emissions by 2040, according to an estimate from initiative organizers, or 5.4% of the current global annual emissions. The firms have committed to measuring and reporting their greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis, implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement\\'s goalposts, and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional and quantifiable offsets. A report issued last month by a U.N. panel that warned that the impacts of human-caused climate change are severe and widespread -- and that while there is still a chance to limit that warming, some impacts will continue to be felt for centuries. The report from the U.N.\\'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for \"immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions\" in order to limit future warming to 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, as is the goal of the Paris Agreement by 2050. The report also warned that unless greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced, the world will exceed 1.5 degrees of warming in the next 20 years. When calling the report a \"code red,\" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres added that, \"The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil-fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk.\" Jeff Bezos, Amazon\\'s then-CEO, announced the Climate Pledge and the company\\'s plan to commit to net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 -- a decade ahead of the international Paris Agreement -- in 2019. At the time, Bezos said that if Amazon \"can meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early, then any company can.\" Christiana Figueres, the U.N.s former climate chief and now founding partner of Global Optimism -- the advocacy group spearheading the Climate Pledge with Amazon -- said in a statement Monday that the IPCC report is the starkest warning yet that \"the window of time to act decisively is narrowing.\" \"This wake-up call from science must be faced with courage and conviction,\" she added. \"In this light, its encouraging that 86 more companies -- some of the largest household names in the world -- are now joining The Climate Pledge, committing to accelerate their actions to tackle climate change in a timely fashion, and playing their part in building a low-carbon economy.\" The private sector has faced immense pressure from consumers and even shareholders in recent years to address climate change. \"Industry\" accounted for a whopping 23% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, behind only transportation (29%) and electricity production (25%) -- data some advocates say highlights the need for large-scale industry changes vs. putting the onus to tackle climate change solely on individuals.\\nOne of the pilots\\' parachutes was caught in a power line. Three homes have been damaged after a military training aircraft crashed in Lake Worth, Texas, according to the Fort Worth Fire Department. The Navy T-45C Goshawk jet trainer aircraft crashed in the backyard of one of the homes, and the debris damaged the nearby structures, Lake Worth Fire Chief Ryan Arthur told reporters at a press conference Sunday afternoon. A military flight student and an instructor pilot were apparently conducting a drill training exercise at the time of the crash, Arthur said. The pilots were on a routine training flight out of Corpus Christi International Airport before the incident, according to a statement from the chief of naval air training. The aircraft is assigned to the training wing of the Naval Air Station in Kingsville, Texas One of the pilot\\'s parachutes got caught in a power line after he was ejected from the plane, he said. The other was found in a neighborhood nearby, Arthur said. Both pilots are being treated at the hospital, Arthur said. The instructor is in stable condition, and the student naval aviator was reported to be in serious condition, but his injuries were not life threatening, according to the military. A small fire resulted from the crash, Arthur said. Three residents of the damaged homes sustained minor injuries and were treated on the scene, according to the Fort Worth Fire Department. \"We are incredibly fortunate that the plane crashed in the backyard of the homes and not the residences themselves,\" a statement from the Fort Worth Fire Department read. More than 40 homes in the area surrounding the crash are experiencing power outages, according to officials. Residents were advised to stay out of the area due to the hazardous material that needs to be cleared. Cleanup crews have been advised by the military that the ejection seats could contain unexploded ordnances. The Navy is cooperating fully with local authorities, the chief of Naval Air Training said, adding, \"We are extremely thankful for the support from Lake Worth and Fort Worth Fire Departments, Lake Worth Police, Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, and other community partners who responded to the scene.\" ABC News\\' Matthew Fuhrman and Flor Tolentino contributed to this report.\\nAt least six people have been killed and 37 wounded, including a 3-year-old boy, in shootings that erupted across Chicago over the weekend, according to police. As of noon Sunday, Chicago police had responded to at least 35 separate shooting incidents across the city since 6:30 p.m. Friday, according to police incident reports reviewed by ABC News. Like other major cities across the country grappling with a rising number of shootings this year, Chicago has deployed a series of strategies to tackle the problem, including a crackdown on illegal guns pouring into the city by targeting firearm straw buyers. Police have also stepped up enforcement in areas that have seen spikes in shootings. So far, nothing seems to have curbed gun violence. In one incident early Sunday, five people ranging in age from 18 to 47 were wounded when two gunmen drove up in a silver sedan, got out and opened fire on a group of people gathered on the street. The gunmen then got back in the car and fled, police said. The mass shooting unfolded just after 3 a.m. in the Austin neighborhood of northwest Chicago, and all of the victims were in serious condition at hospitals, police said. No arrests were made in the incident. Also on Sunday morning, a tow truck driver was shot and killed as he was providing roadside service to a customer in the Englewood neighborhood on the city\\'s South Side, police said. The 27-year-old tow truck driver, whose name was not released, was working when someone approached on foot and shot him multiple times. The victim was taken to the University of Chicago Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, police said. No arrests have been made in the homicide. On Saturday, five other men were fatally shot over the span of about four hours Saturday. Two men, ages 29 and 34, were fatally shot in one incident around 12:14 a.m. Saturday as they were walking on a street in the Lawndale neighborhood on the West Side of the city, police said. Police are searching for a red vehicle they believe the fatal shots came from. Less than an hour later, a 31-year-old man was found shot and unresponsive on a street in the West Pullman neighborhood on the South Side, police said. He was taken to Christ Medical Center and pronounced dead, police said. No arrests have been made. A 21-year-old man was fatally shot around 2:39 a.m. Saturday. Police said the victim, whose name was not released, was arguing with a woman on a street in the East Garfield Park section on the West Side when a gunman walked up and shot him multiple times, including once in the chest, police said. The victim was taken to Mt. Sinai Medical Center and pronounced dead. A little over an hour later, a 33-year-old man died from gunshot wounds he suffered in the River North section of Chicago\\'s North Side when someone in a blue SUV drove by and opened fire, hitting the victim in the chest, police said. The man was pronounced dead at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. At about 10:45 p.m. Saturday, someone fired shots into a home in the Calumet Heights neighborhood on the South Side, hitting a 3-year-old boy in the back, police said. The child was taken to Trinity Hospital and later transferred to Comer\\'s Children Hospital, where he was listed in good condition, according to police. Meanwhile, a 15-year-old girl was among two people shot and wounded as they were standing on a street in the West Englewood neighborhood on the South Side at about 11:18 p.m. Saturday, police said. A gunman, who police are working to identify, opened fire from a distance hitting the girl in the buttocks and a 20-year-old woman in the leg. More than 250 minors have been shot in Chicago so far this year, according to ABC station WLS in Chicago. The shooting of children over the weekend came just two weeks after eight children were shot, including a 4-year-old who was killed over the Labor Day holiday weekend. A total of at least 2,490 people have been shot in Chicago this year, a 9% increase from the same period as last year, according to police department crime statistics. The city has recorded 558 homicides, most of them the result of shootings, this year -- a 3% increase from 2020.\\nA prominent South Carolina lawyer has surrendered to face insurance fraud and other charges in a failed plot to arrange his own death COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Lawyer Alex Murdaugh surrendered Thursday to face insurance fraud and other charges after state police said he arranged to have himself shot in the head so that his son would get a $10 million life insurance payout. The shooter only grazed him. A defense attorney said Murdaugh was deeply depressed with a drug addiction worsened by his discovery of the bodies of his wife and son, who were shot multiple times at the familys home on June 7. Those killings remain unsolved. The three felony charges against Murdaugh, 53, include insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and filing a false police report. He arrived at the Hampton County jail about five hours before his bond hearing. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of all charges, but there is no minimum sentence. The killings of Murdaugh\\'s wife, Maggie, and son Paul in June remain unsolved. Murdaugh spent about five hours in jail before being issued a $20,000 bond and being released on his own recognizance. Prosecutors had asked for a higher bond and GPS monitoring. \"Sometimes those who have everything and who are suffering a possible fall from grace are actually more of a concern than a hardened criminal,\" said Creighton Waters with the South Carolina Attorney General\\'s Office. But Magistrate Tonja Alexander noted Murdaugh had no prior criminal record and she didn\\'t think he would be a risk to the community. Murdaugh\\'s surrender culminated a tumultuous 36 hours for a man whose father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all elected prosecutors in the area. A giant law firm in town was founded by his family more than a century ago. Murdaugh said almost nothing during the brief bond hearing, wearing a light green jail jumpsuit instead of a suit he is accustomed to wearing in a courtroom. Murdaugh\\'s former client was arrested late Tuesday on an assisted suicide charge, and then state police opened a sixth investigation into him and his family -- this time involving a housekeeper and nanny who died in his home in 2018. Murdaugh told his lawyers on Monday that he had arranged his own shooting, and they then spoke to police. \"The only violence he has ever been involved in is this, which was to have himself executed,\" defense attorney Dick Harpootlian said. \"He\\'s not a danger to the community. He\\'s only a danger to himself.\" Murdaugh agreed to give up his passport even as Harpootlian said his client\\'s financial condition is \"ruinous\" and he couldn\\'t leave the country if he wanted to. Murdaugh needed to return to his out-of-state rehab center before the end of Thursday to keep his bed, Harpootlian said. His attorney promised to contact prosecutors and investigators when Murdaugh\\'s rehab stint is finished so they can figure out what to do next. Authorities said Murdaugh asked Curtis Edward Smith to kill him with a shot to the head on Sept. 4 so his surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance policy, authorities said. Murdaugh bought drugs from the former client, Harpootlian has said. Murdaugh\\'s lawyers said he has spent the past 10 days or so in drug rehab after his law firm fired him over missing money that could total millions of dollars. Harpootlian said Murdaugh is fighting a 20-year addiction to painkillers. \"If anyone wants to see the face of what opioid addiction does, you\\'re looking at it,\" Harpootlian said. The investigations into the the Murdaughs started June 7, when Alex Murdaugh found the bodies of his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and their 22-year-old son Paul shot multiple times after returning to their Colleton County home after visiting his sick father, who would die days later from cancer. Those killings remain unsolved, and Murdaugh\\'s lawyers have said he is adamant he had nothing to do with their deaths. On Sept. 3, Murdaugh was fired by the PMPED law firm founded by his family after the firm determined he took money. Murdaugh\\'s lawyers said he decided to kill himself the next day, but have someone else shoot him. Murdaugh gave Curtis Edward Smith a gun and they headed to lonely Old Salkehatchie Road. Smith fired one shot that only grazed Murdaugh\\'s head, a State Law Enforcement Division agent said in a sworn statement. Murdaugh was able to call 911 and his initial story was someone in a passing pickup truck shot at him as he checked a tire that was low on pressure. Smith, 61, remained jailed Thursday on numerous charges, including assisted suicide, assault and battery of a high aggravated nature and distribution of methamphetamine. He didn\\'t have a lawyer or speak about the charges at a hearing where his bond was set at $55,000. Smith left jail hours later. Along with the killings of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh and the shooting of Alex Murdaugh, the State Law Enforcement Division is also investigating the missing money, whether anyone tried to obstruct an investigation into a 2019 boat crash for which Paul Murdaugh was eventually charged and a July 2015 hit-and-run death in Hampton County. The agency also announced Wednesday that they are now investigating Gloria Satterfield\\'s death at the request of Hampton County Coroner Angela Topper, who said her death certificate lists describes natural causes, which is inconsistent with a trip-and-fall accidental death. She said her office did not perform an autopsy because it was not informed. Satterfield\\'s two sons filed a lawsuit Wednesday saying they haven\\'t seen any of the $505,000 wrongful death settlement that Murdaugh had friends arrange. ---- Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP.\\nOfficials found several items that may be linked to Isabella\\'s disappearance. It\\'s been more than a week since the disappearance of 6-year-old Isabella Kalua in Waimanalo, Hawaii. The search for Isabella continues, as Honolulu police and volunteers spread across the city to find the missing child. Isabella was last seen asleep in her room at her Puha Street address on Sunday, Sept. 12 around 9 p.m., local time, according to the Honolulu Police Department. Her adoptive family has not participated in search crews, but their attorney told KITV that they have spoken and are cooperating with police. Since they have received death threats regarding the child\\'s disappearance they have not gone out to search, the attorney said. KITV reports that HPD has acquired several items that may be linked to Isabella, including a photo album and toys found in a garbage bag, but they have yet to confirm its connection to the case. Police are also working with the FBI to investigate her disappearance. \"We have conducted numerous interviews; however, there are still individuals, to include acquaintances and family members, who have yet to come forward to be interviewed,\" HPD said in a statement to KITV. Honolulu Police say it won\\'t rule out foul play. \"I don\\'t want to think the worst-case scenario,\" Alena Kaeo, Kalua\\'s biological aunt told ABC-affiliate KITV. \"But it is always is a possibility. Again, I\\'m trying to keep my faith as strong as possible and I pray -- I pray hard that she is safe. I don\\'t want to think the worst but it is a possibility.\" Isabella is described by authorities as being a brown-eyed, brown-haired, white, and mixed-race girl. Police said Isabella was likely wearing a black hoodie, black leggings, colorful socks, and Nike slides when she went missing.\\nMOSCOW -- Russias ruling party, United Russia, which backs President Vladimir Putin, has kept its supermajority in the countrys parliament, sweeping elections that were marred with allegations of widespread ballot rigging and saw many of the Kremlins top opponents barred from running. With virtually all ballots counted, Russias elections commission said United Russia had taken nearly 50% of the vote and won nearly 90% of first-past-the-post districts, meaning the party will retain its two-thirds majority in the lower house of parliament, which allows it to change Russias constitution. Russias elections are closely managed, and the pro-Kremlin partys victory was seen as a foregone conclusion, but on Monday, opposition parties accused the Kremlin of using blatant fabrication to inflate the result and produce an overwhelming win even in Moscow, usually a center of dissent. After polls closed Sunday night after three days of voting, early partial results showed several opposition parties and politicians making strong showings in the capital, with some seemingly in reach of victory with most votes counted. But those results were all wiped out when, after many hours, authorities published results from online voting, which handed victories to pro-Kremlin candidates. Opposition parties, even those from the so-called \"loyal opposition,\" cried foul, accusing the Kremlin of using the online votes to conceal vote manipulation and steal victory for its candidates. The Communist Party, which largely acts as a tame opposition in the parliament, said it would not recognize the results in Moscow, where six of its candidates lost out once the online votes were added. Critics started raising suspicions about Moscows online count after it took far longer for it to be completed than the paper ballot count for most of the rest of the country -- a sign, critics said, that officials were waiting to see how much they needed to alter the vote. The online voting was in effect a black box, with independent monitors unable to observe it or properly check how the results were signed off on by officials, independent monitors said. Workers at state companies and organizations have also reported being pressed by their managers to vote online en masse. Several candidates called a protest at Moscows Pushkin Square on Monday. A few hundred people gathered under heavy rain to demonstrate, watched by a cordon of riot police. \"Such a giant difference between the results at the \\'live\\' polling stations and the online vote cant be true,\" Mikhail Lobanov, a Communist candidate with wide support among liberal voters, told the crowd, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Lobanov said he had been on track to beat Yevgeny Popov, a pro-Kremlin TV personality, by a margin of 10,500 votes before the online votes suddenly gave Popov a lead of 20,000 votes at the last moment. There were also allegations of widespread analogue ballot rigging around Russia. Throughout the weekend, there was a stream of videos seeming to show elections officials stuffing wads of ballots into voting urns or trying to block monitoring cameras while others did so. Independent researchers also spotted that Russia\\'s central elections committee now encrypts the results data published on its website, a step reportedly intended to prevent researchers from crunching the data themselves, which in the past has allowed them to identify signs of rigging. \"Online voting represents right now represents an absolute evil -- a black box that no one checks,\" Sergey Shpilkin, a data scientist who in the past has used statistical analysis to demonstrate likely falsification in Russian elections, told Russian news website Meduza. The head of Russias elections commission Ella Pamfilova in a video meeting with Putin said the elections had seen far fewer violations than usual and claimed Russias system was \"one of the most transparent\" in the world. The United States and some European countries criticized the elections as unfair amid the Kremlin\\'s use of repressive laws to prevent opponents from participating. Ned Price, the U.S. State Department\\'s spokesperson, in a statement said the Russian government had conducted \"widespread efforts to marginalize independent political figures\" and had \"severely restricted political pluralism and prevented the Russian people from exercising their civil and political rights.\" United Russia took nearly 50% of the vote despite polls suggesting its support was around 30%, as high food prices and unpopular pension reforms have eaten into its popularity. Ahead of the elections, the Kremlin launched a campaign of repression on a scale unprecedented under Putins 20 year-rule, barring dozens of opposition candidates from running, with many arrested and some forced abroad. It dismantled the movement of its fiercest critic Alexey Navalny, who was jailed in January after surviving a nerve agent poisoning last year. Navalny, from jail, had sought to exploit the Kremlin partys unpopularity at the elections with a tactical voting campaign called \"Smart Voting,\" advising people to vote for any candidate with the best chance of beating United Russia. On Monday, he claimed the campaign had worked, arguing the campaigns recommended candidates had won 12 out of Moscows 15 districts before the online votes were added. The Communist Party notably improved their share of the vote across Russia, taking around 19%, up from 13% five years ago, in a sign of a growing protest vote among Russians weary with Putins two-decade rule, experts said. Several opposition figures and election monitors alleged the fraud in these elections was worse than in 2012, when a rigged parliamentary election prompted mass street protests, the largest ever under Putin. This year, there appeared no sign those protests would be repeated amid a far more repressive environment in Russia. And though Navalny\\'s team said they would support any peaceful demonstrations called to protest the falsification, they did not call for any themselves.\\nThis comes on the 10th anniversary of the repeal of \"don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell.\" LGBTQ veterans who were given other than honorable discharges from the U.S. military due to their sexual orientation are eligible to receive full benefits, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced on Monday. \"LGBTQ+ Veterans are not any less worthy of the care and services that all Veterans earn through their service, and VA is committed to making sure that they have equal access to those services,\" the department said in a statement. The policy statement comes on the 10th anniversary of the repeal of the controversial 1993 law known as \"don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell,\" which banned LGBTQ service members who were open about their sexual orientation from serving in the military. Overall, an estimated 100,000 were discharged from the U.S. military due to their sexual orientation, including an estimated 14,000 service members who were discharged under \"don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell,\" during the 17 years that it was in effect, according to the VA. \"This historic move ends an unjust practice and creates a smoother pathway for life-saving benefits like healthcare, pensions, and housing assistance to finally go to the LGBTQ service members, as well as people with HIV, who were discharged during and before Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell only because of who they are,\" said GLAAD Chief Communications Officer Rich Ferraro in a statement. \"On the ten year anniversary of the repeal of Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell, we\\'ve seen LGBTQ service members serve strong and proud and today\\'s move from the VA will help so many LGBTQ and other veterans who were unjustly removed from service prior to the repeal.\" The VA statement was shared by Kayla Williams, the assistant secretary for public affairs in VA\\'s office of public and intergovernmental affairs, who is bisexual, but previously chose not to disclose her sexuality under the policy of \"don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell.\" \"It took many years for me to shed the toxic legacy of having served under DADT and come back out of the closet; I\\'m proud to recognize this anniversary as my authentic self,\" Williams said. In order to reenlist in the military and access medical care, compensation, a military pension as well as education, home loan and insurance benefits, a service member has to be discharged honorably. And although \"don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell,\" did not require that veterans be discharged dishonorably, some veterans were given other than honorable discharges because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or HIV status, making them ineligible for benefits. According to a 2016 report by The Associated Press, less than 8% of veterans who were expelled from the military under \"don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell\" applied to upgrade their discharges to honorable or strip references to their sexual orientation from their record. The VA said in a statement it hopes that the policy statement would encourage more LGBTQ veterans who were discharged dishonorably to reach out to the VA to reassess their eligibility for benefits. \"Given that large numbers of LGBTQ+ Veterans who were affected by previous homophobic and transphobic policies have not applied for a discharge upgrade due to the perception that the process could be onerous, we are hopeful that this policy statement encourages more of them to contact VA to determine their eligibility for care and services,\" according to a VA statement. \"Don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell,\" was signed into law in 1993 under the administration of President Bill Clinton, who initially sought to end a World War II-era ban on homosexuals serving in the military. Amid backlash from some military leaders and members of Congress, Clinton managed to get support for an apparent compromise, which would allow LGBTQ individuals to serve in the military if they did not disclose their sexual orientation. During his first term in office, President Barack Obama voiced his support for repealing the law. The U.S. Senate passed a measure to end the policy in December 2010, with the support of 65 senators, including six Republicans. Obama signed it into law in 2010, but it didn\\'t not go into effect until Sept. 20, 2011. \"It is time to close this chapter in our history. It is time to recognize that sacrifice, valor and integrity are no more defined by sexual orientation than they are by race or gender, religion or creed. It is time to allow gay and lesbian Americans to serve their country openly,\" Obama said at the time. President Joe Biden marked the 10th anniversary of the repeal on Monday and voiced his support for the LGBTQ community. \"Despite serving with extraordinary honor and courage throughout our history, more than 100,000 American service members have been discharged because of their sexual orientation or gender identity--including some 14,000 under Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell,\" Biden said in a statement released by the White House. \"Many of these veterans received what are known as \"other than honorable\" discharges, excluding them and their families from the vitally important services and benefits they had sacrificed so much to earn.\" ABC News\\' Tony Morrison contributed to this report.\\nAlso according to \"Peril,\" Biden and his aides grapple with Trump\\'s legacy. A new book details scenes from the early days of Joe Biden\\'s presidency, including that Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly complained to Biden about calling him a \"killer\" in an ABC News interview. \"I\\'m upset you called me a killer,\" Putin said to Biden on an April 13 phone call, Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa wrote in their new book, \"Peril.\" Biden told Putin his comment, made in a March 16 interview with ABC News\\' George Stephanopoulos, was \"not something premeditated,\" according to the book. \"I was asked a question. I gave an answer. It was an interview on a totally different topic,\" Biden said, before he invited Putin to meet with him in person. Stephanopoulos interviewed Woodward and Costa Monday on \"Good Morning America,\" in their first interview about the book\\'s contents. The book, obtained by ABC News ahead of its Sept. 21 release, recounts the 2020 presidential election and the chaos of the final months of the Trump administration -- before and after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot -- based on more than 200 interviews with firsthand witnesses and participants. \"Peril\" also chronicles the first several months of Biden\\'s presidency, detailing his administration\\'s efforts to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, early efforts to work with Congress and internal deliberations over the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. This includes how Biden has apparently adjusted to life in the White House, which he reportedly called \"the tomb\" and likened to the Waldorf Astoria hotel. \"It was lonely. Cold. The virus made social events impossible, at least at the start,\" Woodward and Costa wrote, adding that Biden preferred \"relaxing with the grandkids back in Delaware.\" \"Being upstairs at the White House feels like you\\'re staying at someone else\\'s house,\" White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain is quoted as telling others, according to the book. The book also describes how Biden and his aides reportedly refer to Trump in private: The president and his advisers \"hated to utter Trump\\'s name,\" and aides avoided using \"the \\'T\\' word,\" the authors claim. \"Trump\\'s existence permeated the White House, even the residence. One night, Biden wandered into a room where a huge video screen covered the wall. To relax, Trump used to upload programs to virtually play the world\\'s most famous golf courses,\" they wrote. \"\\'What a f------ a------,\\' Biden once said as he surveyed the former president\\'s toys.\" Biden\\'s aides \"noticed he could be prickly and tough at times and would walk into the Oval Office unhappy some mornings about another round of Trump talk on MSNBC\\'s pundit roundtable, \\'Morning Joe\\',\" Woodward and Costa wrote in the book. Woodward and Costa claimed Biden\\'s aides worked to keep him away from \"unscripted events or long interviews\" to avoid gaffes, a \"cocooning of the president\" known as \"the wall,\" they wrote. On Afghanistan, Biden eventually overruled Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in his decision to withdraw U.S. troops, after both secretaries suggested a phased pullout to try to encourage a political settlement with the Taliban, according to \"Peril.\" \"Our mission is to stop Afghanistan from being a base for attacking the homeland and US allies by al Qaeda or other terrorist groups, not to deliver a death blow to the Taliban,\" Biden said in a National Security Council meeting, according to the book. Biden \"said he did not know what would come next. The outcome was unclear, he acknowledged,\" they claimed in the book.\\nMOSCOW -- A gunman opened fire at a university in the Russian city of Perm on Monday, killing at least six people and injuring about two dozen others, according to Russian authorities. The shooter, who police said was a student at the college, entered a campus building at Perm State University where classes were taking place and started shooting with a shotgun. Police said officers confronted the shooter and detained him after he was seriously injured in a gunfight. He was transported to a hospital for medical treatment and is now in critical condition, according to Russia\\'s Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes. Initially police said eight people had been killed, but health authorities later revised that to six dead as of late afternoon Monday. Twenty-eight people had sought medical attention with injuries of various degrees of severity, Perm\\'s health ministry said, 19 of them with gunshot wounds. Shortly after the attack happened, videos posted on social media showed panicked students jumping out of windows to escape and barricading themselves inside classrooms. Semyon Karyakin, a second year geology student, said he was in an elevator coming downstairs after a class when he heard gunshots. \"The doors opened, two girls ran in and behind them were shots,\" Karayakin told ABC News by phone. He said the elevator had opened onto the hallway where the gunman had just entered the building and he believed the attacker had fired shots after the two women. The students retreated up a floor, he said, but the gunman by then had also already made his way up the stairs. \"We were again lucky because the lift again managed to close and we managed to get out of there. In the other case I wouldnt be talking with you,\" he said. The group hid in a classroom, trying to bring in other students, and barricaded themselves there until police arrived, he said. The shooter was stopped by a traffic officer who happened to be at the campus, according to police. Officer Konstantin Kalinin told Russian television he and his partner had run to the building after a witness told them there was a shooter. While his partner helped evacuate people, Kalinin said he went looking for the attacker. \"I ran into the building to the first floor, I saw how an armed young man was coming down the stairs,\\' Kalinin said in a video interview. \"I shouted at him, \\'Drop it,\\' to which the young man pointed the gun at me and let off shots. After which I used my weapon.\" After the shooter fell to the ground, Kalinin said he ran over and kicked his weapons away. \"And then after that I started giving him first aid,\" he said. Russian state media named the suspect as Timur Bekmansurov, an 18-year-old student studying law. An account with Bekmansurov\\'s name on the Russian social media network VKontakte published a lengthy post shortly before the attack which describes fantasizing about carrying out a mass killing at a public place. In the post, the person wrote he has no religious or political motive and said he had dreamed of the killing \"for years.\" A post accompanying that one showed the suspected shooter in a helmet and with ammunition cartridges around his chest, giving the finger to the camera. Russia\\'s Investigative Committee said it has opened a murder investigation and is investigating the circumstances of the shooting. Bekmansurov bought the shotgun used in the attack in May and had acquired it legally, Russia\\'s National Guard told the state news agency TASS. Monday\\'s mass shooting was one of the deadliest in recent Russian history. Unlike in the United States, school shootings are rare in Russia; though attacks by students have started to become more frequent in recent years. In 2018, an 18 year-old student shot and killed 20 people and wounded 70 others before taking his own life at Kerch Polytechnic College in Crimea. That has stirred demand recently for authorities to strengthen safeguards around gun ownership. In May this year a 19-year-old killed nine people and injured 20 when he opened fire at a school in Kazan, also using a weapon he had acquired legally. That shooting prompted Russian President Putin then to order rules be tightened for owning a weapon. The Kremlin\\'s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday defended government efforts to strengthen the rules, saying work had been done to do so. \"But, unfortunately, you see, the tragedy has happened and now it has to be analyzed,\" he told reporters.\\nData shows the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for children ages 5 to 11, the companies announced Monday morning. \"We are eager to extend the protection afforded by the vaccine to this younger population, subject to regulatory authorization, especially as we track the spread of the delta variant and the substantial threat it poses to children,\" Pfizer chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. \"Since July, pediatric cases of COVID-19 have risen by about 240 percent in the U.S. -- underscoring the public health need for vaccination.\" There were 2,268 participants ages 5 to 11 in the trial, which, while it still followed a two-dose regimen, used a lesser dose than the amount given to people ages 12 and older, for the \"safety, tolerability and immunogenicity\" of younger children. \"In participants 5 to 11 years of age, the vaccine was safe, well-tolerated and showed robust neutralizing antibody responses,\" the companies said in a news release. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to share their data with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency and other regulators soon and will submit a request for emergency use authorization in the United States. The FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine, which is marketed as Comirnaty, for people ages 16 and older in August. It is currently authorized for emergency use in children ages 12 to 15. \"These trial results provide a strong foundation for seeking authorization of our vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, and we plan to submit them to the FDA and other regulators with urgency,\" Bourla said. Results from two other ongoing trials -- one of children ages 2 to 5 and one of children 6 months to 2 years old -- are expected as soon as later this year, the companies said. Pfizer has also received emergency use authorization from the FDA to give a third dose of vaccine to those 12 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise. However, a panel advising the federal government on vaccines recently rejected President Joe Biden\\'s suggestion to roll out booster shots for all Americans, recommending that for now, a third dose should only be given to those 65 and older or those at high risk of severe COVID-19.\\nHer boyfriend, named a person of interest, has not been seen since Tuesday. A body \"consistent with the description of\" Gabby Petito, the 22-year-old woman who went missing while on a cross-country road trip with her boyfriend, was discovered in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming. The FBI Denver, the National Park Service and law enforcement made the announcement during a news conference Sunday evening in Grand Teton National Park. Charles Jones, the FBIs supervisory senior resident agent, said that a full forensic identification hasnt yet been completed, but investigators did notify Petitos parents. A cause of death was also undetermined. Jones declined to comment further on the investigation. \"We continue to seek information from anyone who utilized the Spread Creek Dispersed Camping Area between the dates of August 27 and August 30. Anyone that may have had contact with Gabby, or her boyfriend or who may have seen their vehicle in that area, please share any new information with the FBI,\" Jones said. An attorney for the Petito family released a statement Sunday evening asking for privacy to grieve and also thanking the agencies that assisted in the search. \"Your tireless work and determination helped bring Gabby home to her parents,\" the statement said. \"The family and I will be forever grateful.\" North Port Police tweeted that it will be working with the FBI in its investigation. \"Our focus from the start, along with the FBI, and national partners, has been to bring her home,\" the department tweeted. The Teton County coroner confirmed to ABC News on Sunday afternoon that the agency dispatched resources to a body found in the national forest. No further details were disclosed. The development came as a search for Brian Laundrie, Petito\\'s boyfriend, resumed in Florida. Petito\\'s parents reported her missing on Sept. 11 after not speaking with her for two weeks. Laundrie had been named by police as a \"person of interest\" in Petito\\'s disappearance. The 23-year-old Laundrie, who returned home more than two weeks ago without Petito and has refused to speak to police, has not been seen since Tuesday, according to law enforcement officials. The Laundrie family attorney said in a statement Sunday evening, \"The news about Gabby Petito is heartbreaking. The Laundrie family prays for Gabby and her family.\"\\nEfforts to combat misinformation intensified on Twitter during the days leading up to Tuesdays recall election to replace California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who appears to have retained his gubernatorial seat, according to an ABC News projection of the election results. Since the 2020 presidential election, there\\'s been more awareness of the damaging effects of the spread of misinformation on social media with fears that increasing numbers of people are engaging with false content. The Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, which provides record management and election services, said it took to Twitter to counter misleading information and provide context to viral posts leading up to the recall election. The department said it also used Twitter to clear up confusion over casting ballots, ballot status and the color of ballot boxes. For example: in response to a viral photo reposted on Twitter showing an election worker wearing a \"Trump 2020\" hat and shirt, the department clarified on Tuesday that the person was later contacted and was \"no longer working at the vote center.\" The photo racked up more than 34,000 likes and more than 8,000 retweets by Thursday, according to statistics on the post, with some Twitter users debating the legality of an election worker wearing political clothing. The departments response also garnered notable engagement on Twitter and was referenced by other users, further spreading the update that the department removed the worker. Mike Sanchez, spokesperson for the LA County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, said the worker broke the departments internal policy requiring nonpartisan clothing for employees, adding that the worker was released after he refused to change. First Draft director Claire Wardle said the departments Twitter activity was \"a very good sign\" that organizations are making an effort to combat misinformation, even before it goes viral. First Draft is an organization that describes itself as working to \"protect communities from harmful misinformation\" through knowledge, research and training. Wardle said the department took an approach known as \"prebunking,\" which includes correcting false claims, answering questions early on and providing explanations. \"All of that is helping people get a much better sense about what to trust and what not to trust,\" Wardle said. Wardle said an important part of the process is to give context to posts that may not be fake, but could still be misleading and damaging. On the weekend before the recall election, the department said it fielded numerous questions after an \"equipment issue\" reportedly caused some voters to have trouble casting their ballots. Throughout the weekend, the department posted on Twitter that voters who encountered the issue were given provisional ballots and that the equipment was replaced. The departments repeated reinforcement of accurate information may have helped resolve confusion on the issue, it says, preventing it from spiraling into full-fledged falsehoods. Conservative radio host Larry Elder, the frontrunner to replace Newsom if recalled, made unsubstantiated claims of possible voter fraud during the recall election, saying there could be \"shenanigans\" similar to some unsubstantiated claims of a rigged 2020 presidential election. The country clerk, in real-time on social media, addressed concerns or questions pertaining to the recall election, arguably helping to ward off their evolving into a misinformation wildfire spreading through the internet. The department said in one instance, it answered a Twitter users question about the equipment issue within five minutes. Other responses came several hours later or the next day. Sanchez, in addition to being a spokesperson, led the team that monitored social media platforms during the recall election. He said while the majority of posts were general voting inquiries, the team took action when it identified misleading and inaccurate information. \"We provide resources and try to quell those who are aiming to mislead or misguide and -- or in some cases interfere -- with the election and the information that goes along with obviously educating voters,\" Sanchez said. Sanchez said the department has been actively monitoring and engaging with social media for years, including during the 2020 presidential election. Last year, the department was countering misinformation about ballots, he said, and even calming fears about fire alarms. \"These [social media platforms] are very powerful tools. Our voters are on them. We should be on them as well and leverage their ability to reach masses,\" Sanchez said. Twitter has made strong statements against election misinformation on its platform and has implemented a labeling policy. \"However, the volume and speed at which misinformation has the potential to spread online means that this alone is not enough. Twitter said in January that it was piloting a new approach to addressing misinformation on the platform, alongside its labeling policy, to \"broaden the range of voices\" involved in the process.\" Wardle pointed to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection as a catalyst that may have influenced organizations to focus more on battling political misinformation. Wardle said the 2020 election and events that followed were an example of \"the harm that can be done if you leave misinformation to flourish.\" \"It\\'s a really critical time now to try and rebuild trust in the electoral system,\" Wardle said. While there is a spotlight on election misinformation this year, policing online misinformation is not a new strategy. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency launched its rumor control page ahead of last years presidential election, with the goal to help voters \"distinguish between rumors and facts on election security issues.\" Public figures in key battleground states also used Twitter to dispel falsehoods during the presidential election. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel warned voters in 2020 about misinformation related to robocalls and voters with outstanding warrants. The Philadelphia District Attorneys Office utilized an election task force last year, which also highlighted misleading information.\\nThe building faced millions of dollars in repairs, according to documents. When a condo building suddenly collapsed in the Miami Beach area earlier this summer, killing 98, it shocked the nation. Rescuers worked for days at the Champlain Towers South in Surfside to try to find survivors in the rubble. But hope faded after all surviving victims were rescued and the mission shifted to recovery. In the wake of the collapse, profound grief and questions about how a massive concrete structure could just fall to the ground lingered. As federal investigators piece together evidence, a trail of documents indicated the 12-story, 136-unit oceanfront condo building had substantial concrete structural damage to its pool deck area and was overdue for repairs. While federal authorities have not yet concluded the investigation to determine the cause of the fall, a number of experts and engineers believe prolonged structural damage, delayed repairs and environmental issues over four decades could have contributed to the building\\'s deterioration. Here is what we know: \\'Independent spirit\\' The Champlain Condominium Towers North and South were built in 1981 in Surfside, Fla. a neighborhood that sits just north of Miami. \"Surfside always had an independent spirit. The Surf Club was really the center of Surfside and it was built in 1930. The owners and the members of that club. wanted to have their own neighborhood and didn\\'t want to be part of Miami Beach,\" Daniel Ciraldo, executive director of the Miami Design Preservation League, told ABC News. During the 70\\'s and 80\\'s, Miami city leaders were looking to transition into a higher-end market, according to the New York Times at the time. But at that time, a quarter of South Beach Miami was made up of mostly retired residents, many of whom protested the idea of rebuilding the city as many feared displacement. \"In 1973, a building moratorium was imposed partially due to a decaying Miami and concerns about the sewage system,\" Ciraldo said. To rectify this, the condominium developers fronted at least half of a $400,000 bill to fix the sewage issue and resume construction, according to a Miami Herald report from 1979. The Champlain Towers were the first condominiums built once the moratorium was lifted. Early signs of damage Signs of structural damage to the Champlain Towers South\\'s pool deck and garage ceiling were reported as early as 1996. Western Water Co., a local contractor, noted in a report the pool deck of the Champlain condo building and the ceiling of the underground parking garage beneath needed \"concrete structural repair.\" The work was later completed and certified to the city in November 1997, according to documents obtained by ABC News. \"The most common problems are weather intrusions. The way you combat that is with good quality solid weatherproofing and paint; and those repairs need to be identified when they happen and repaired in order to maintain the strength and integrity of the building,\" Peter Dyga, the president and CEO of Associated Builders & Contractors, Florida East Coast Chapter (a national construction industry trade association), told ABC News. 40-year recertification underway After a Miami-area building collapse in 1974, county lawmakers enacted a mandatory inspection for commercial and residential buildings 40 years after they\\'re constructed. The Champlain towers were in the process of recertification when part of the building came crashing down. Morabito Consultants, a structural engineering firm, was hired by the condo association in 2018 to conduct the inspection and reported, among other things, concrete structural damage  to concrete structural slabs on the pool deck due to failed waterproofing. They estimated repairs would cost more than $9 million, but those repairs were never completed. Frank Morabito, a consultant and engineer from Morabito Consultants, declined to comment to ABC News. \\'Very good shape\\' Despite the structural engineering report and the detailed construction plan from Morabito, Rosendo \"Ross\" Prieto, the former Surfside building inspector, told residents at Champlain Tower South at a board meeting in November 2018 that their building was \"in very good shape,\" according to records released by the city of Surfside. \"When things happen related to building construction, builders are generally the scapegoats and it may be the quality of the building,\" Dyga told ABC News. \"On the other end of the problem is with a building. One that is most common that we see is failing to maintain. One of the most important things about building maintenance is weatherproofing,\" Dyga added. In April, two months prior to the collapse, Champlain condo owners received an itemized bill from the board, a two-page letter obtained by ABC News shows. The estimated repair costs was nearly $15 million, $6 million more than what Morabito assessed three years before. The owners were expected to begin making payments beginning July 1. Following the collapse, Prieto, who was no longer Surfside\\'s building inspector, was placed on a \"leave of absence,\" according to a statement from the city of Doral, where he had been listed as interim building inspector but has since been removed. He has not responded to ABC News\\' repeated requests for comment. \\'The future\\' In the wake of the collapse, Miami-Dade County inspected more than 500 buildings that were approaching the 40-year recertification deadline to identify any obvious structural concerns. Buildings in Surfside that are more than 30 years and more than three stories high were notified to begin recertification. Surfside operates as its own city and has its own building department. \"The future is what is the capacity of a small town when we\\'re talking about really large development projects?,\" Ciraldo said. \"And the corollary of what is the ability of a volunteer condo association to be the permanent stewards of these properties,\" he continued. In late July, a Florida judge ordered the families who suffered losses from the collapse to be compensated $150 million -- $50 million in insurance and nearly $100 million in proceeds upon the property sale. At the conclusion of the federal agency National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) investigation, which could take several years according to NIST experts, Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle has pledged to bring the matter to a grand jury, which will gather evidence and hear testimony and could recommend criminal charges or needed reforms.\\nMore than a century ago, the globe was left devastated by a pandemic that has been described by experts as \"the deadliest in human history.\" The 1918 influenza pandemic killed at least 50 million people worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, equivalent in proportion to 200 million in today\\'s global population. An estimated 675,000 of those deaths occurred in the United States. Now, 18 months into the coronavirus pandemic, the virus has claimed more American lives than its counterpart a hundred years ago. At this point, at least 675,446 Americans have been confirmed to have died since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, with thousands of Americans lives still being lost each day. Surpassing the 1918 death toll is a dismal milestone, but experts suggest there are key differences between both pandemics that must be taken into account, given modern day access to better medical treatments and vaccinations. \"These are two different viruses, two different times in history, at two different times of medical history, with what you have available to combat or treat it,\" Howard Markel, professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan, told ABC News. The influenza outbreak of 1918 began in the spring, with the novel H1N1 virus passing from birds to humans, and lasted for approximately two years. Approximately one-third of the world\\'s population at that time, or 500 million people, was ultimately estimated to have been infected, according to the CDC. According to experts, it is important to recall, when comparing data from the two pandemics, that the numbers of deaths stemming from the 1918 pandemic are just estimates. In fact, according to Dr. Graham Mooney, assistant professor of the history of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, it is likely that these figures were significantly underestimated, because of non-registration, missing records, misdiagnosis or underreporting. Likewise, experts believe that the current COVID-19 death count could already be greatly undercounted, due to inconsistent reporting by states and localities, and the exclusion of excess deaths. In comparing the pandemics, Markel said, it is important to remember that we now have many more people living in the U.S. than in 1918, when the population stood at approximately 105 million, according to census data, compared to 328 million people in 2019. The U.S. currently has a coronavirus case fatality rate of 1.6%, compared to the 2.5% fatality rate for influenza in 1918, noted Mooney. Normally, the flu\\'s fatality rate is less than 0.1%. And thus, the rate of death in the United States, due to COVID-19, remains significantly below the one attributed to the 1918 pandemic. Ultimately, when compared on a per-capita basis, the pandemic of 1918 was far deadlier than this one, according to Christopher McKnight Nichols, associate professor of history at Oregon State University. \"The difference is that 1 in 500 Americans have died now, and about 1 in 152 died in 1918, although our number keeps going up,\" Nichols told ABC News. Vaccinations and traditional intervention methods key to protection Although the two pandemics were at first comparable, the introduction of the coronavirus vaccine made the differences between the two \"stark,\" said Nichols. \"People were desperate for treatment measures in 1918. People were desperate for a vaccine,\" Nichols said. \"We have effective vaccines now, and so what strikes me in the comparison, if you think about this milestone, this tragedy of deaths, is that same number but we have a really effective treatment, the thing that they most wanted in 1918 and \\'19, we\\'ve got. And for a lot of different reasons, we botched the response.\" Similar to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, no vaccines or treatments were available to protect people against the 1918 influenza. Thus, protection through non-pharmaceutical interventions was critical, Mooney said. \"The same kinds of measures -- the so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions that were put on in 1918 -- were the same that we saw last year: lockdowns, social distancing, hygiene masks, limits on gathering places,\" Nichols said. In fact, social distancing was also one of the great historical lessons learned from 1918, according to Markel, demonstrating that if done early, and for a long time, such measures can work. Millions of different communities and demographics affected One fundamental contrast between the two pandemics, according to Markel, is that different age groups were most significantly impacted. A disproportionate number of those who succumbed to the disease in 1918 were in the 18- to 45-year-old age group. Young children and the elderly were also significantly impacted. However, in the coronavirus pandemic, the age group that has been the most affected is over the age of 65, who make up 78.7% of virus-related deaths. Historical evidence suggests that racial and ethnic disparities, which have affected communities of color throughout the coronavirus pandemic, were also present during the 1918 pandemic. Black Americans had higher case fatality rates from influenza in 1918-19 than whites, according to a 2019 study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. Similarly, Black Americans account for nearly 14% of COVID-19 related deaths, despite the fact that Black Americans only account for 12.5% of the population. Becoming endemic Domestically and globally, experts said, it will be crucial for vaccine uptake to increase, in order to blunt the impact of the coronavirus death toll. \"I\\'m a little pessimistic going into winter, given the fact that there\\'s such a large unvaccinated population that it is a lot like 1918,\" Nichols said, adding that it will ultimately be \"some combination of getting more of the population immune, with vaccines and with infections.\" Ultimately, although \"it\\'s not the worst of all time, it\\'s pretty darn close,\" Markel said of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"It\\'s the worst of our lifetimes, and it\\'s changed our lives in so many ways.\"\\nA decorated group of more than 500 current and former American women Olympians and professional and collegiate athletes is warning the U.S. Supreme Court in a new legal filing that eroding access to abortion care in America will be \"devastating\" to women\\'s athletics at all levels. \"If the state compelled women athletes to carry pregnancies to term and give birth, it could derail women\\'s athletic careers, academic futures, and economic livelihoods at a large scale,\" the women write. \"Such a fundamental restriction on bodily integrity and human autonomy would never be imposed on a male athlete, though he would be equally responsible for a pregnancy.\" Among the named signatories are U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe; Olympic water polo player Ashleigh Johnson; WNBA star Diana Taurasi; U.S. women\\'s soccer national team captain Becky Sauerbrunn; and, Layshia Clarendon, a former WNBA all-star and current vice president of the Women\\'s National Basketball Players Association. The filing -- known as an amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief -- was made in the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\'s Health Organization, a blockbuster abortion rights showdown scheduled for oral argument at the Supreme Court on Dec. 1. The state of Mississippi has explicitly asked the court to overturn nearly 50 years of abortion rights precedent since the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, allowing states to set stringent new restrictions on early term abortions, if not outlaw them entirely. \"As women athletes and people in sports, we must have the power to make important decisions about our own bodies and exert control over our reproductive lives,\" Rapinoe said in a statement. \"I am honored to stand with the hundreds of athletes who have signed onto this Supreme Court brief to help champion not only our constitutional rights, but also those of future generations of athletes.\" The signatories are all women who \"have exercised, relied on the availability of, or support the constitutional right to abortion care in order to meet the demands of their sports,\" according to the brief. Women\\'s rights advocates said it was the first time a large group of female American athletes publicly took a stand in support of abortion access. Crissy Perham, a double gold medalist and captain of the 1992 U.S. Olympic swim team, offered one of several personal testimonies in the brief attesting to her experience obtaining an abortion. \"When I was in college, I was on birth control, but I accidentally became pregnant,\" she wrote. \"I decided to have an abortion. I wasn\\'t ready to be a mom, and having an abortion felt like I was given a second chance at life.\" \"That choice ultimately led me to being an Olympian, a college graduate and a proud mother today,\" Perham wrote. Several athletes described the importance of the Supreme Court precedent in laying the groundwork for more women to participate in athletics and as a \"safeguard\" in case birth control failed. \"As a victim of rape during my junior year of college, I was comforted in the fact that if I were to fall pregnant and need an abortion, I would have access to that service,\" a Division I field hockey player, who was not identified by name, wrote in the brief. Ashleigh Johnson, the first Black woman on the U.S. Olympic water polo team and member of the gold-medal 2016 and 2021 Olympic teams, said she wants the justices to see abortion access a matter of racial justice. \"It is well-established that women of color experience real disparities in accessing health care services, including contraceptive, abortion and other reproductive care,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"I hope we can have a real conversation as a country about valuing Black women\\'s autonomy.\" The case will be argued in December and is expected to be decided by the end of June 2022.\\nA federal law enforcement officer was arrested carrying a gun at Saturdays rally at the U.S. Capitol billed to support the suspects charged in Januarys insurrection, but he will not be prosecuted WASHINGTON -- A federal law enforcement officer was arrested carrying a gun at Saturdays rally at the U.S. Capitol billed to support the suspects charged in Januarys insurrection but will not be prosecuted. The 27-year-old New Jersey man is an officer with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He was arrested by Capitol Police for illegally possessing a gun on the grounds of the Capitol after people in the crowd reported seeing him with a handgun and notified nearby officers. His arrest and presence at the event were surprising because the rally was billed as an event to support those who have been charged in Januarys riot. That riot left dozens of police officers beaten, bloodied and bruised as the crowd of pro-Trump rioters, some armed with pipes, bats and bear spray, charged into the Capitol, quickly overrunning the overwhelmed police force. During January\\'s riot, one officer was beaten and shocked with a stun gun repeatedly until he had a heart attack; another was foaming at the mouth and screaming for help as rioters crushed him between two doors and bashed him in the head with his own weapon. Law enforcement officials had prepared extensively for the possibility that Saturdays rally could devolve into violence -- bringing back the fence around the Capitol, activating the citys entre police force and requesting assistance from the National Guard -- taking no chance as they aimed to avoid a repeat of the Jan. 6 attack. Police had also warned they would come down hard on anyone who violated Washingtons gun laws. But there were very few incidents on Saturday and only a handful of arrests. Four people were arrested, including the Customs and Border Protection officer. Generally, under federal law, law enforcement officers are given reciprocity to legally carry their weapons in other states, even those with restrictive gun laws. But the law has an exemption for government property or military bases where it is illegal to carry a gun, like the U.S. Capitol. A spokesman for the U.S. attorneys office in Washington said prosecutors were \"not moving forward with charges\" but did not provide additional information about the decision. Two law enforcement officials said the officer was not at the rally in any official capacity. The officials could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. The Department of Homeland Securitys inspector general was also notified of his arrest. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was aware of the arrest and was \"fully cooperating with the investigation.\" \"CBP stresses honor and integrity in every aspect of our mission and expects officers to adhere to the oath they take to uphold the laws of this country,\" the agency said in a statement.\\nA lawyer for Donald Trumps indicted corporate finance chief told a judge Monday he has \"strong reason to believe\" more indictments are coming in an ongoing New York investigation into the former presidents real estate empire NEW YORK -- A lawyer for Donald Trumps indicted corporate finance chief told a judge Monday he has \"strong reason to believe\" more indictments are coming in an ongoing New York investigation into the former presidents real estate empire. Lawyer Bryan Scarlatos made the remark during Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselbergs first court appearance since his July 1 arraignment on tax fraud charges. Scarlatos did not say what led him to believe more people would be charged. In recent weeks, a pair of Trump Organization executives have testified before a grand jury in the case. Under New York law, grand jury witnesses are granted immunity and can not be charged for conduct they testify about. The Manhattan District Attorneys office declined comment. \"Mr. Weisselberg is separate from the Trump Organization. He is the only individual here whose liberty is at stake,\" Scarlatos said. \"What I am concerned about is that he will become collateral damage in a larger fight between the Trump Organization and the DAs office.\" Scarlatos raised the issue of more possible indictments while arguing for more time to review up to 6 million pages of documents that he said prosecutors are turning over as evidence, calling it \"a herculean task\" and saying new indictments would create a \"moving target.\" Prosecutors said Weisselberg is \"no stranger\" to many of the documents because they include Trump Organization business records that the executive likely produced or reviewed as part of his job. Judge Juan Manuel Merchan gave both sides until next spring to file motions and responses. He said hed decide on motions at a July 12, 2022, hearing, the next time Weisselberg is due in court. Merchan said he expected to set a trial date at that time and would likely schedule it for the end of August or beginning of September next year. \"The reason I mention it now is that its on everybodys radar,\" Merchan said. \"I dont have an exact date yet.\" Weisselberg has pleaded not guilty to charges he collected more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation, including apartment rent, car payments and school tuition. Trumps company is also charged in the case, which prosecutors have described as a \"sweeping and audacious\" tax fraud scheme. One of the Trump executives granted immunity to testify before the grand jury is the companys director of security, Matthew Calamari Jr. Prosecutors have been looking at him and his father, Trump chief operating officer Matthew Calamari Sr., in their probe of untaxed benefits. A lawyer for the Calamaris said in a statement responding to Scarlatos remarks that he was not aware of any plans to indict the elder Calamari. \"We remain in discussions with the district attorneys office relating to Matthew Calamari (Sr.), but continue to believe there is no basis for indicting him,\" lawyer Nicholas Gravante said. \"If they presently intended to indict him, I would have been informed. I havent been and, in fact, have been informed to the contrary.\" Weisselberg sat quietly next to his lawyers at Monday\\'s brief hearing and didn\\'t speak to reporters on his way to and from court. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, everyone wore masks and the courtroom had clear plastic partitions between various parties. Trump himself has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He has condemned the case, the first to arise from New York authorities two-year investigation into the former presidents business dealings, as a \"political Witch Hunt.\" Trump has said his companys actions were standard practice in the business and in no way a crime. According to the indictment, from 2005 through this year, the Trump Organization and Weisselberg cheated tax authorities by conspiring to pay senior executives off the books by way of lucrative fringe benefits and other means. Weisselberg alone was accused of defrauding the federal government, state and city out of more than $900,000 in unpaid taxes and undeserved tax refunds. The most serious charge against Weisselberg, grand larceny, carries five to 15 years in prison. The tax fraud charges against the company are punishable by a fine of double the amount of unpaid taxes, or $250,000, whichever is larger. Weisselberg\\'s lawyers, Skarlatos and Mary Mulligan, said in a statement after Monday\\'s hearing that the indictment is \"full of unsupported and flawed factual and legal assertions.\" \"We look forward to challenging those assertions in court,\" the lawyers said. The 74-year-old Weisselberg has intimate knowledge of the Trump Organizations financial dealings from nearly five decades at the company. The charges against him could enable prosecutors to pressure him to cooperate with the investigation and tell them what he knows, but so far there have been no signs of that. The case is being led by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats. The Trump Organization is the entity through which the former president manages his many ventures, including his investments in office towers, hotels and golf courses, his many marketing deals and his TV pursuits. According to the indictment, Weisselberg paid rent on his Manhattan apartment with company checks and directed the company to pay for his utility bills and parking, too. The company also paid for private school tuition for Weisselbergs grandchildren with checks bearing Trumps signature, as well as for Mercedes cars driven by Weisselberg and his wife, and gave him cash to hand out tips around Christmas. Such perks were listed on internal Trump company documents as being part of Weisselbergs compensation but were not included on his W-2 forms or otherwise reported, and the company did not withhold taxes on their value, prosecutors said. Trumps company also issued checks, at Weisselbergs request, to pay for personal expenses and upgrades to his homes and an apartment used by one of his sons, such as new beds, flat-screen TVs, carpeting and furniture, prosecutors said. ---- Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak\\nAs the Biden administration continues to grapple with a surge of Haitian migrants on the border, images have surfaced showing the tactics used by the U.S. Border Patrol agents riding horses to control the crowd around the river. Video from news outlets Reuters and Al Jazeera appear to show a Border Patrol agent as he snaps his horse\\'s reins in the direction of a migrant who then stumbles back into the Rio Grande. But it\\'s unclear from the video if the agent was simply using his reins to control the horse and prevent it from falling into the water. The agent is seen repeatedly pacing back and forth across the river entrance on horseback. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday that the department is investigating the incident and will respond if needed. At a press conference Monday afternoon, Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz defended the use of horseback patrol as a vital tool for law enforcement to maintain visibility in hard-to-reach areas of the border. \"The horse patrol units down here are going to play an integral role in the security response,\" Ortiz said. \"So it\\'s important that the Border Patrol agents maintain a level of security for themselves and for the migrant population,\" he added. Later on Monday a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the Customs and Border Protection\\'s Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating the incident and had alerted an independent federal watchdog. \"The footage is extremely troubling and the facts learned from the full investigation, which will be conducted swiftly, will define the appropriate disciplinary actions to be taken,\" the spokesperson said. Mayorkas traveled to Del Rio, Texas, where more than 14,000 migrants surged the border over the past week, to make assurances that the Biden administration has the situation under control and to warn migrants on the other side not to cross illegally. About 10,400 migrants are currently at the encampment, according to official updates provided to local authorities in Del Rio. \"We have reiterated that our borders are not open and people should not make the dangerous journey,\" Mayorkas said at a press conference Monday. The secretary provided few new details about how the federal government was responding to the efforts. He did however note the surge in resources that have been brought to the area in an effort to process those who have arrived. Specifically, Mayorkas said, the U.S. would use at least one to three flights per day to remove migrants who the government says did not have a valid claim to stay in the U.S. A source familiar with the plans said as many as seven flights per day could be used. \"If additional staff is needed, more will be sent,\" Mayorkas said. DHS has even asked the Pentagon for help in securing additional air travel for the migrants. Aircraft under contract with the military, not military planes themselves, would be used and refunded by homeland security. Large groups of migrants left Haiti for South America between 2010 and 2012 after a massive earthquake devastated the country. Many arriving now in Texas have not lived in Haiti in about a decade. Mexico has also seen a surge in asylum applications from Haitian nationals with about 13,000 filed this past year, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The majority of those crossing continue to face removal under a part of U.S. federal law known as Title 42, which the administration has used to restrict migration in the name of public health. Immigrant advocates have called the use of the public health order a violation of the humanitarian protections that migrants are due. \"Local groups, faith-based institutions, universities, businesses and entire communities have shown greater leadership in welcoming refugees than any we have seen from the White House in recent years,\" Amnesty International USA Executive Director Paul O\\'Brien said in a statement Monday. \"The U.S. can and we must do better.\" The administration is also considering a request from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott that President Joe Biden declare an emergency in the state. A disaster declaration would allow for additional federal assistance for the already strained official presence in the area. ABC News\\' Kenneth Moton and Luke Barr contributed to this report.\\nBrian Laundrie is a person of interest in the death of his girlfriend. A massive search is continuing in Florida for Brian Laundrie, the boyfriend of Gabby Petito, the 22-year-old woman who went missing on a cross-country trip and who authorities confirmed as the body discovered in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming. The search for the 23-year-old Laundrie is centered around North Port, Florida, where investigators said Laundrie returned to his home on Sept. 1 without Petito but driving her 2012 Ford Transit. Laundrie has been named by police as a \"person of interest\" in Petito\\'s disappearance. Laundrie has refused to speak to the police and has not been seen since Tuesday, Sept. 14, according to law enforcement officials. The search for Laundrie is the latest twist in the case that has grabbed national attention as he and Petito had been traveling across the country since June, documenting the trip on social media. Petito\\'s parents, who live in Long Island, New York, reported her missing on Sept. 11 after not hearing from her for two weeks.\\nFormer President Trump\\'s top military adviser was \"not going rogue\" when he held secret phone calls with his Chinese counterpart before and after the 2020 election, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa said on \"Good Morning America\" Monday. \"He was not going rogue,\" Costa told ABC News\\' George Stephanopoulos in an exclusive interview. \"He was reading people in throughout the national security community, trying to contain a situation and a president he believed was in serious mental decline.\" According to their new book \"Peril,\" which chronicles the end of the Trump administration, Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Chinese Gen. Li Zuocheng in October 2020 and January 2021 to dispel Chinese fears that Trump was planning a secret attack and to assure him the U.S. was not on the verge of collapse after the Capitol riot. \"If we\\'re going to attack, I\\'m going to call you ahead of time. It\\'s not going to be a surprise,\" Milley said on the October call, according to the book. While Trump and Republicans accused Milley of treason and called on President Joe Biden to fire him amid reports of his phone calls, Costa told Stephanopoulos that Milley was \"reading people in\" on his conversations, suggesting that their reporting in the book was being misconstrued. Even though the calls \"were held on a top secret back channel, they were not secret,\" Costa said. \"This was not someone who was working in isolation.\" Added Woodward: \"Two days after the insurrection at the Capitol was a moment of maximum tension.\" Speaking to The Associated Press last week in Greece, Milley said the calls were \"routine\" and done \"to reassure both allies and adversaries in this case in order to ensure strategic stability.\" He said he was prepared to defend his actions in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee next week. The new book, which goes on sale Sep. 21, also details how former Vice President Mike Pence grappled with his duties to certify the election results on Jan. 6, as Trump repeatedly pressured him to overturn Biden\\'s victory. Pence consulted the Senate parliamentarian and former Vice President Dan Quayle on how to approach his ceremonial role presiding over the electoral vote count. \"You don\\'t know the position I\\'m in,\" Pence told Quayle. \"I do know the position you\\'re in,\" Quayle replied, according to the book. \"I also know what the law is. You listen to the parliamentarian. That\\'s all you do. You have no power.\" Pence, who is eyeing a 2024 White House bid, was \"trying to ride both horses,\" Woodward said. He was trying to \"do his constitutional duty but also keep the avenues to Trump open,\" Woodward added. Woodward and Costa conducted more than 200 deep background interviews with witnesses or firsthand participants in events described in the book.\\nInternational travelers to the US will need to be fully vaccinated. The White House on Monday announced a new international air travel system to start in early November that will ease travel restrictions from other countries but require all foreign nationals traveling to the United States to be fully vaccinated and test negative for coronavirus before boarding a U.S. bound plane -- a move that will allow families who have been separated by travel restrictions since March 2020 to reunite. The announcement came as President Joe Biden prepared to head to the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Monday and a day before he was to meet at the White House with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who reportedly was expected to call on Biden to ease travel restrictions. The new system will no longer block international travelers from individual countries, but instead apply the same rules to every country: entry to the US requires full vaccination and a negative test three days before traveling. \"This new system allows us to implement strict protocols to prevent the spread of COVID from passengers flying internationally into the United States by requiring adult foreign nationals traveling to the United States be fully vaccinated,\" said Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. \"This is based on individuals rather than a country-based approach, so it is a strong system.\" Once in the US, fully vaccinated international travelers will not be required to quarantine for 14 days, but the White House said it will be stepping up its contact tracing efforts by collecting contact information of U.S.-bound travelers and sharing it with state and local public health officials to alert travelers if they have become exposed to COVID-19. As for unvaccinated Americans, international travel will require more stringent requirements under the new plan. They will be required to have a negative test within one day of boarding a flight to the US and will be required to test again upon arriving. The current CDC guidelines for Americans traveling internationally, whether they are vaccinated or not, requires proof of a negative test three days before departure in order to enter the US. The new plan also involves continued mask wearing during air travel, a mandate that Biden extended to last until Jan. 18 last month. \"It\\'s simple: Masking help stop the spread of COVID-19. If you break the rules, be prepared for the consequences,\" Zients said. The specific vaccines that qualify a traveler as \"fully vaccinated\" will be determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Zients said, and the administration did not outline any vaccine requirements for domestic travel, though they said aren\\'t taking any options off the table. The administration hopes that Biden\\'s recent rule requiring federal workers and businesses to be vaccinated will be help increase vaccination rates in the U.S. \"We clearly have a track record that shows we\\'re pulling available levers to require vaccinations and we\\'re not taking any measures off the table on specific authorities used for implementation,\" Zients said.\\nThe Biden administration over the weekend outlined steps it plans to take in response to a surge of migrants along the southern border attempting to gain entry into the small town of Del Rio, Texas. U.S. Customs and Border Protection sent more than 400 personnel to the area to assist with processing and the Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday it plans to increase removal flights to Haiti as a result. Other countries will be considered for resettlement, the department said, particularly those where migrants last resided. The Biden administration is going beyond the border with its response. One of the prongs in its swift reaction to the migration surge is to work with the Haitian government, and other regional governments, on resettlement. Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said at a press conference Sunday that the administration was moving quickly to increase removal flights of Haitians from the border and said he hoped to have all of the migrants processed in less than a week. \"They will be removed and they will be sent back to their country of origin,\" Ortiz said of migrants without a legitimate claim to stay. They expect to have 3,000 migrants transferred away from the bridge within the next 24 hours, the chief said. Ortiz outlined steps currently being taken by immigration authorities in response. Officials continue to provide water, toilets, towels, medical care and within the next 24 hours, CBP will have sent 600 personnel to the area. The chief compared the influx to levels seen in 2019, but acknowledged the rate of crossings has been greater this time. Haitians have moved through Del Rio in the past, the chief said, and word of mouth could be a driving factor for those crossing now. CBP decided to close the Del Rio Port of Entry late Friday in an effort to gain control of the influx. Instead, traffic is being redirected nearly 60 miles south to the Eagle Pass Port of Entry. \"This temporary closure and shift is necessary in order for CBP to respond to urgent safety and security needs presented by an influx of migrants into Del Rio and is effective immediately,\" CBP said in a statement. \"It will advance and protect national interests and help ensure the safety of the traveling public, commercial traffic, and CBP employees and facilities.\" The number of migrants camped out under the bridge in Del Rio, Texas, has grown to about 13,000, according to Val Verde Country Sheriff Joe Frank Martinez, who is receiving regular updates from Border Patrol and has personally observed the encampment. Border Patrol leadership traveled to Del Rio area and Ortiz planned to meet with stakeholders and community leaders Sunday afternoon. \"People in D.C. need to get off the bench and get in the game,\" Martinez told ABC News. \"This is a serious situation here.\" CBP did not say how long the border crossing would be closed. The agency is also making efforts to transport migrants elsewhere to ensure timely processing. About 2,000 have been moved so far. Some are already being sent back on flights directly to Haiti, where most of the migrants are reportedly from. The influx has strained local resources and prompted the Department of Homeland Security to order up basic resources, including water, towels and portable toilets. Del Rio is a small town of about 30,000 more than two hours outside of San Antonio and has consistently struggled to handle the repeated influx of migrants coming across the border over the past year. The Biden administration continues to warn migrants about the dangers of attempting to cross without authorization. \"Irregular migration poses a significant threat to the health and welfare of border communities and to the lives of migrants themselves, and should not be attempted,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. U.S. authorities remain under strain following the Biden administration\\'s decisions to roll back some of the hard-line measures rolled out by the Trump administration. Under orders from a federal judge, Biden officials have been forced to reinstate the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy while it challenges the orders in court. Last month, immigration authorities stopped migrants from illegally crossing the border more than 200,000 times. The numbers represent a nearly 20-year high, although many of the arrests involve repeat offenders.\\nPerhaps there is no better sign that fall has arrived than the magical placement of Mickey-themed wreaths aligning Main Street, U.S.A. at Magic Kingdom Park.

In 1981, \"Broadway at the Top\" dinner show was introduced with popular catchy show tunes sung by talented performers. In 1995, the space transformed into California Grill - with fresh, seasonal dishes prepared in the stunning on-stage kitchen. The impressive wine list showcasing the finest wines from highly allocated California vineyards further elevated the dining experience. California Grill was considered a cutting-edge concept (especially for a theme park), becoming a sought-after dining destination for our guests as well as catching the culinary worlds attention. And it continues to dazzle and impress all these years later! Through the years, the menu has evolved but continues the focus on seasonal dining with a creative blending of flavors, textures, and techniques. The stellar award-winning wine list is still as impressive but has made room for craft cocktails and beers. What has remained constant is the stunning views of Magic Kingdom Park and Seven Seas Lagoon. As part of \"The Worlds Most Magical Celebration,\" California Grill will offer a limited-time three-course menu with dishes inspired by past favorites as well as new market-fresh creations. Here are just a few items (OK, my faves!) on this 50th anniversary celebration menu. Including sushi on this special menu was a given! The California Grill Sushi Classics Trio - Blue Crab California Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Spicy Kazan Roll - brings together three of the most popular rolls on one plate. I love the Spicy Kazan Roll with blue crab, yellowfin tuna tataki, and sweet shrimp. But what makes this sushi roll unique is the Fireball Sauce with bay scallops, avocado, and mango, bringing the flavor to another level. The House-Made Artisanal-Style Duck a la Orange Pizza has a fun backstory. Long Island Duckling with Orange Sauce was on the original Top of the World menu, and with artisanal flatbreads and pizzas from the on-stage wood-fired grills being a guest favorite, it made perfect sense to marry the two! Enter this delicious pizza with duck prosciutto and confit, orange-black mission fig jam, pickled shallots, aged blue cheese, and arugula - an homage to the classic from Top of the World and a California Grill staple. The Oak-Fired Filet of Beef with Black Truffle-Brown Butter Chateau Potatoes, Golden Raisins Vinaigrette, Cauliflower, and Black Garlic Butter has layers of incredible flavors. I LOVE a great filet (and the chefs top this one with roasted tomato butter - yum!), but these Chateau Potatoes are beyond fabulous - slowly cooked in brown butter and topped with freshly shaved black winter truffles. Delicious! \"The Worlds Most Magical Celebration\" deserves a classic dessert that never goes out of style, and this delectable EARidescent Grand Marnier Souffle is perfection. Served table-side with macerated Florida citrus and a delicious house-made Creamsicle Ice Cream. A sweet ending, indeed. Peruse the full menu below. Enjoy! This incredible limited-time three-course menu will be offered starting Oct. 3, with reservations available Sept. 23.

Theme park music transports me to places only Disney can create, and fill my mind with incredibly happy memories. It should be no surprise then that my library is overflowing with Disney tunes. My parents purchased the \"Official Album of EPCOT Center\" following our first visit in 1983. After hearing the stirring opening strings of the \"Main Entrance Melody\" and the joyful \"One Little Spark,\" I was hooked on Disney music. My sister and I created interpretive dances for each track (luckily no video exists of those performances). As a teenager, I remember falling asleep to the 1991 \"Official Album of Disneyland and Walt Disney World.\" I even wrote to Walt Disney Records asking for more unreleased music. My wishes would come true in the late 1990s when the make-your-own-CD kiosks called \"Walt Disney World Forever\" were briefly introduced at what we now call Disney Springs. Fast forward to today, and Im still collecting soundtracks. The image above contains a sampling of CD covers from my library. My most recent acquisition is a 1973 picture-disc titled \"A Musical Souvenir of Walt Disney Worlds Magic Kingdom\" (seen in the first image). Gavin Greenaways magnificent score to the \"Tapestry of Nations\" parade at EPCOT is my favorite. As a Disney cast member, I learned even more about the many individuals who created the soundtrack to my life. On windows above the Emporium on Main Street, U.S.A., in Magic Kingdom Park, you will spot two names - G. Bruns and B. Baker. These Disney Legends were instrumental in creating music still heard at Walt Disney World Resort nearly 50 years later. Composer-conductor George Bruns was hired by Walt Disney to score the animated feature \"Sleeping Beauty.\" He also wrote \"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\" and provided music for films such as \"Babes in Toyland\" and Disneys \"Robin Hood.\" For the theme parks, he contributed music to Pirates of the Caribbean and Country Bear Jamboree in Magic Kingdom Park. And speaking of Magic Kingdom ... I love this hidden musical surprise on Center Street, the side street near Uptown Jewelers: Listen carefully to hear singing lessons and the sound of a piano coming from a second story window! Buddy Baker composed more than 200 scores for Disney motion pictures, television and theme parks, As musical director for EPCOT, Buddy supervised and composed music for the Future World pavilions and World Showcase. Among the attractions he scored were The Land pavilion, The American Adventure and \"Impressions de France\"; for the latter, he wove a tapestry of original music and classical works by French composers such as Debussy, Ravel and Satie. With the nighttime spectacular \"Harmonious\" debuting at EPCOT on Oct. 1 to help kick off the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World Resort, I know my love for Disney music will continue growing during the next 50 years. Coming soon, the Walt Disney World official playlist! Stay tuned in the coming weeks to listen to all your favorite Walt Disney World tunes in one place.

Less than two years later, 22-year-old Marine Cpl. Hunter Lopez is being laid to rest, one of the 13 U.S. service members killed in the attack at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan on Aug. 26. His parents intended to honor Hunters request, \"but I just couldnt find the courage to part with the lightsaber he built,\" Mrs. Lopez said through tears. So the Lopezes, along with their 18-year-old son and 17-year-old daughter -- just six days after Hunters death -- drove from their home in Indio to build a replica of the lightsaber Hunter had created in Savis Workshop in Star Wars: Galaxys Edge. And this one, built by his entire family, would be buried with him. \"As we walked into Disneyland, the marching band was coming out onto Main Street [U.S.A.] and started to play a Star Wars song,\" Mrs. Lopez recalled. \"We dont know if it was Disney magic or whether it was Hunter, but either way it felt good knowing he was there with us.\" A friend of the couple, both of whom work for the Riverside County Sheriffs Department, helped arrange for the family to build the lightsaber privately at Savis, followed by lunch at the membership restaurant, Club 33, to which the friend belongs. As soon as Club 33 Member Services Coordinator Rex Roberts heard that the family would be coming later that day, he advised a few resort leaders to see what else they could do, given Disneys legacy of honoring military service personnel, veterans and their families. Members of SALUTE -- the cast member Business Employee Resource Group (BERG) that supports veterans and members of the military -- connected with Dan Hughes, vice president of Security at the resort. \"We took the American flag that was flying over Disneyland and quickly had it framed and created a plaque, so we could present it to the family,\" Dan shared. In the space of 90 minutes, he was on his way to Club 33. \"I said, \\'Your sons sacrifice means the world to our country and also to us at Disneyland, and its our honor to give you this token of our appreciation,\" Dan recounted. \"Mrs. Lopez broke down in tears and said, \\'My son loved Disneyland, and the whole room got choked up.\" Mrs. Lopez said later that the family has been annual passholders for decades and that Hunter had loved coming to the parks since he was a toddler -- the spinning tea cups at Mad Tea Party were his favorite. He loved Winnie the Pooh so much as a child that his mother still called the Marine by his nickname, \"Hunter Pooh.\" But Star Wars was his passion, she said. \"Hed dress up as a Jedi for Halloween, he knew all the movies, all the lines -- even the background characters.\" Mrs. Lopez laughed as she recalled that when she was pregnant with her second child, then-5-year-old Hunter asked if he could name the baby \"Uncle Owen\" after the Star Wars character Owen Lars. They agreed to keep the name Owen, and laughed as they explained to Hunter why theyd have to drop \"uncle.\" In fact, Owen had enlisted in the Army just hours before the family received a knock on the door from casualty notification officers about Hunter, who had wanted to follow in his parents footsteps in law enforcement with the Riverside County Sheriffs Department. At Club 33, 13 glasses of champagne were lined up on the service counter on the day of the Lopez familys visit as a tribute to all 13 service members lost last month. \"Disneyland is all about celebration and happiness, so its not often that we see or hear this in our work,\" said Club 33 General Manager Luke Stedman. \"But in this divisive world, when we can all come together and support something so meaningful, its a reminder of how much pride our cast can take in what this place means to people.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden found videos of tactics used by Border Patrol agents on horseback against Haitian migrants at the Texas border \"horrific and horrible,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. \"I don\\'t know anyone who could watch that video and not have that emotion,\" Psaki said on \"CBS Mornings.\" The videos from outlets including Reuters and Al Jazeera appear to show a mounted Border Patrol agent snap his horse\\'s reins in the direction of a migrant who then stumbles back into the Rio Grande near Del Rio, Texas. However, it is unclear from the video if the agent was using his reins to control the horse and prevent it from falling into the water. At the United Nations Tuesday, reporters asked Biden for his reaction to the images of U.S. Border Patrol agents confronting migrants near where thousands of Haitians are camped under a bridge. \"Well get it under control,\" he said. The video comes as more than 14,000 Haitian migrants surged over the border in Del Rio in the past week. Psaki said that the videos were inconsistent with the values of the administration, and vowed to pursue an investigation, a sentiment shared by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas in a statement Monday. \"I think it\\'s important for people to know this is not who we are,\" Psaki said. \"That\\'s not who the Biden-Harris administration is, and we\\'re going to absolutely pursue that investigation and get to the bottom of what happened here.\" Speaking to reporters in Washington, Vice President Kamala Harris also commented for the first time on the images, calling the treatment \"horrible\" and saying she supported an investigation backed by Mayorkas. \"What I saw depicted about those individuals on horseback treating human beings the way they were, was horrible,\" Harris said. \"And I fully support what is happening right now, which is a thorough investigation into exactly what is going on there. But human beings should never be treated that way. And I\\'m deeply troubled about it, and I\\'ll also be talking to Secretary Mayorkas today about it.\" On the Senate floor Tuesday, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called on the Biden administration to halt expulsions of Haitian asylum seekers under Title 42, calling the images of immigrants being rounded up by horseback \"stomach-turning.\" \"I urge President Biden to put a stop to these expulsions and to end this title 42 policy at our southern border,\" Schumer said. \"We cannot continue these hateful and xenophobic Trump policies that disregard our refugee laws.\" At the end of a Capitol Hill hearing Tuesday, Mayorkas welcomed questions about the images. He outlined the steps announced by the Homeland Security Department Monday night, including the request for an independent federal investigation as well as an internal review. \"I was horrified to see the images, and we look forward to learning the facts that are produced from the investigation and we will take actions that those facts compel,\" he said. \"We do not tolerate any mistreatment or abuse of a migrant. Period.\" The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Professional Responsibility began investigating the incident Monday night. A spokesperson for the agency said that it \"does not tolerate the abuse of migrants in our custody\" and takes the allegations seriously. \"The footage is extremely troubling and the facts learned from the full investigation, which will be conducted swiftly, will define the appropriate disciplinary actions to be taken,\" the spokesperson said. CBP has not said whether it will continue to use agents on horse patrol in Del Rio or elsewhere along the border while it investigates. During a press briefing Monday, Psaki said that the White House needed more context for the images, but said that even without \"full context\" she didn\\'t think it would be acceptable action. \"We just saw this footage, it\\'s horrible to watch. I just have to get more information on it,\" Psaki said. \"I don\\'t have more information on it. I have also seen the video. I can\\'t imagine what the scenario is where that would be appropriate.\" Mayorkas said the administration plans to empty out the Del Rio encampment within the next 10 days, saying the number of migrants there was now \"well under ten thousand.\" \"We are hoping that what we are doing now serves as a deterrent,\" Mayorkas said, noting some in Mexico have turned away from the border recently. ABC News\\' Ben Gittleson, Justin Gomez, Luke Barr and Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.\\nA Michigan lawmaker who got a personal protection order against another lawmaker has filed some unflattering text messages in court LANSING, Mich. -- A Michigan lawmaker told another lawmaker that he hoped her \"car explodes on the way in,\" according to text messages filed in court to support a request for a personal protection order. \"Youre truly the worst human being Ive ever met. I mean that with the utmost sincerity. Just a parasite,\" Rep. Steve Marino told Rep. Mari Manoogian. Marino, a Macomb County Republican, and Manoogian, an Oakland County Democrat, had a personal relationship that ended more than a year ago. Manoogian, 29, obtained a protection order last week from a judge, a few days after Marino, 32, was removed from House committees for alleged abuse. State police are investigating. There was no indication in the court file when the text messages were written, The Detroit News reported. Marino said he hoped Manoogians \"car explodes on the way in\" and warned her to \"hide on the House floor\" in a series of texts in which they also discussed issues being handled by a state House committee. \"After trying to ignore Steves threats and harassment for 21 months, and begging him to stop texting me in this harassing manner countless times, I had no choice but to report his abuse to my Democratic leader,\" Manoogian said in a court filing. Marino said he\\'s a victim of \"character assassination.\" His attorney, Mike Rataj, said they would challenge the protection order. \"These statements are so out of context, and were simply going to move to set it aside,\" he said. The order could conflict with Marino\\'s ability to vote on the House floor if Manoogian is present. Lawmakers will be in Capitol on Tuesday.\\nSmoke and flames have shot fom part of the roof at New Orleans\\' Superdome as crews worked to clean and prepare the sporting and entertainment arena for painting NEW ORLEANS -- Smoke and flames shot through the side of the Superdome\\'s roof on Tuesday as crews worked to clean and prepare the New Orleans sports and entertainment arena for painting. The New Orleans Fire Department confirmed firefighters responded to flames on the building\\'s roof shortly before 1 p.m. The fire appeared to be under control a short time later. Crews were power washing the roof this week to prepare it to be painted, officials said. The fire happened in a section of Superdome roofing called the \"gutter tub,\" said ASM Global VP of stadiums Doug Thornton, speaking with The Times Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate. ASM Global manages the Superdome. A spokesman did not immediately respond to a telephone call from The Associated Press. The NFLs New Orleans Saints have regularly played home games at the venue, often drawing capacity crowds. The Superdome also has been the site of seven Super Bowls in recent decades. The next Saints home game at the Superdome is scheduled for Oct. 3 when the team faces the New York Giants. The teams final preseason home game slated for Aug. 28 was canceled due to impending Hurricane Ida, which made landfall the next day. Since the storm, the team has been practicing in the Dallas area. The team\\'s Sept. 12 game against the Green Bay Packers was moved to Jacksonville, Florida, out of concerns for the citys wider infrastructure and Dome staff although the Dome itself was not damaged during Ida.\\nA former Massachusetts mayor who was once a rising Democratic star after being elected at age 23 has been sentenced to six years in prison in a corruption case BOSTON -- A former Massachusetts mayor, once a rising Democratic star after being elected at just 23 years old, was sentenced to six years in prison on Tuesday after being convicted of extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars from marijuana businesses that wanted to operate in his city. Former Fall River Mayor Jasiel Correia showed no emotion as the judge handed down his punishment after tossing several convictions stemming from allegations that the now 29-year-old swindled investors who backed a smartphone app he created. U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock assailed Correia\\'s actions as old-style corruption that eviscerates a community. Under Correia\\'s watch, \"City Hall was for sale,\" said the judge, who also criticized his \"absolute lack of remorse.\" \"If we cant trust each other, if we cant trust our government, where are we?\" the judge asked. Correia, who has insisted that he\\'s innocent and that the \"real truth\" will eventually come out, did not make a statement during the hearing in Boston federal court because he\\'s still challenging his remaining convictions. The defense had sought three years, telling the judge that while there\\'s no \"sugarcoating\" the case, Correia also did much good for Fall River. \"None of that excuses what happened here, but I think it\\'s required to have a fuller picture of the man and to understand how somebody might get derailed but still have hope to contribute in a future chapter of life,\" Attorney William Fick said. Correia is expected to report to prison at a later date that has yet to be decided. Correia was convicted in May of a slew of charges including fraud and extortion after a trial that shone a light on his meteoric rise to become mayor as a recent college graduate. Correia portrayed himself to voters as a successful entrepreneur who could breathe new life into the struggling, old mill city. Prosecutors told jurors that in reality Corriea funded his lavish lifestyle with money he stole from investors who pumped cash into his app called \"SnoOwl,\" which was designed to help businesses connect with consumers. Prosecutors said Correia took nearly two-thirds of the almost $400,000 he got from investors and spent it on things like fancy hotels and a Mercedes and to pay down his student loans. After becoming mayor in 2016, prosecutors say Correia started a pay-to-play scheme involving bribes from marijuana vendors in exchange for letters of approval from the city they needed in order to get a license. Prosecutors have called the corruption scheme particularly galling because much of it occurred when the former mayor knew he was already under investigation for the allegations of investor fraud. Assistant U.S. Attorney Zach Hafer -- who asked for 11 years behind bars -- questioned how anything other than greed and hubris could explain Correia\\'s actions, noting that the former politician had a supportive family and was making good money as mayor. \"The cash in clipboards and in envelopes and sheds. ... Fall River under Jasiel Correia was like Atlantic City during Prohibition in terms of the crudeness of the corruption,\" Hafer said. Correia told reporters outside the courthouse after his conviction that \"the justice system failed us\" and that he had turned down a plea deal because, he said: \"I\\'m not guilty.\" Both the prosecutor and Correia\\'s trial attorney said Tuesday that Correia was never offered a plea agreement. Correia was supposed to have been sentenced Monday, but the judge instead agreed with new lawyers hired by Correia after the trial to overturn the jury\\'s guilty verdict on several counts they said the government failed to prove. The judge agreed to toss six counts of wire fraud because of what he described as a lack of evidence about how the checks were processed. He also tossed two tax fraud counts because he said prosecutors didn\\'t prove that Correia willfully filed false returns. Correia remains convicted of several counts of wire fraud, extortion and extortion conspiracy. The jury acquitted him on three counts, including accusations that he forced his chief of staff to give him half of her salary in order to keep her city job. For months after his arrest, Correia resisted calls to leave office and survived a bizarre election in March 2019 during which he was recalled by voters and reelected the same night. But after federal agents arrested him a second time -- this time for the extortion scheme -- he agreed in October 2019 to take a leave of absence. He was ousted by voters the next month.\\nThe bureau has also increased the number of agents working these cases by 260%. FBI Director Christopher Wray told a U.S. Senate panel Tuesday morning that the bureau has been forced to surge resources toward its domestic terrorism investigations in the past 18 months -- increasing personnel by 260% to help handle a caseload that has more than doubled from roughly 1,000 ongoing investigations to 2,700. \"Terrorism moves at the speed of social media,\" Wray told the Senate Homeland Security Committee. \"You have the ability of lone actors, disgruntled in one part of the country to spin up similar like-minded individuals in other parts of the country and urge them into action.\" Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, who appeared alongside Wray, agreed with him that social media is a \"terrain that can so easily propagate misinformation, false information and allow communications to occur among loosely affiliated individuals.\" Wray offered more detail during questioning with Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah. \"The first bucket, the homegrown violent extremists, has been humming along fairly consistently at about 1,000 investigations -- sometimes a little more sometimes a little less -- over the last few years,\" Wray explained. \"The domestic violent extremists bucket, had been going up quite significantly over the last few years, which is why we\\'re now at 2,700 domestic terrorism investigations when if you went back two and a half years ago we\\'re probably more about 1,000 So it\\'s been a really significant jump there.\" Wray added that officials are \"concerned that with developments in Afghanistan, among other things... I think we anticipate, unfortunately, growth in both categories as we look ahead, over the next couple years.\" Those numbers appear to be impacted significantly by the FBI\\'s hundreds of ongoing investigations into the attack on the U.S. Capitol. \"Overall, the FBI assesses that the January 6th siege of the Capitol Complex demonstrates a willingness by some to use violence against the government in furtherance of their political and social goals,\" Wray said in written testimony provided to the Senate Homeland Security Committee. \"This ideologically motivated violence -- domestic terrorism -- underscores the symbolic nature of the National Capital Region and the willingness of some Domestic Violent Extremists to travel to events in this area and violently engage law enforcement and their perceived adversaries.\" Wray said that even with the surge of resources to tackle domestic terrorism cases, the FBI has not been forced to divert attention away from investigations into threats posed by foreign terrorist organizations like al-Qaida and ISIS, and added the bureau is \"certainly watching the evolving situation in Afghanistan.\" In the past several years, Wray said the FBI has thwarted potential terrorist attacks in at least seven cities, including Las Vegas, Tampa, New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Miami and Pittsburgh. Wray also flagged what he described as \"a sharp and deeply disturbing uptick in violence against the law enforcement community.\" He said thatin just the past eight months, 52 law enforcement officers have been killed feloniously in the line of duty, already lapsing the total number killed in all of 2020.\\nHe told the General Assembly the world was at \"an inflection point in history.\" President Joe Biden on Tuesday delivered his first speech as president to the United Nations General Assembly, telling diplomats that they were meeting at a moment \"intermingled with great pain and extraordinary possibility.\" He pitched his vision for America\\'s return to the world stage -- in sharp contrast with years of bellicosity from his predecessor, President Donald Trump -- in which Biden said the U.S. would helm the response to the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis, and put behind decades of conflict in favor of diplomacy and partnership. The world, he said, stood \"at an inflection point in history,\" saying that, \"to fight this pandemic, we need a collective act of science and political will.\" \"Today, many of our greatest concerns cannot be solved or even addressed through the force of arms,\" Biden said. \"Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19, or its future variants.\" His remarks were a laundry list of his goals -- with some of the strongest words reserved for the climate crisis -- that largely glossed over recent tensions with allies regarding the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan. \"We\\'ve ended 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan,\" Biden said, \"and as we close this period of relentless war, we\\'re opening a new era of relentless diplomacy of using the power of our development aid to invest in new ways of lifting people up around the world.\" He did not make even a passing reference to a recently announced defense partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom aimed at curbing China\\'s influence on in the Indo-Pacific region, which led Australia to nix a major defense deal with France for nuclear-powered submarine technology. That, in turn, prompted France to recall its ambassador from the U.S. and express its displeasure with Biden. As he left the United Nations complex, a reporter asked Biden how he planned to repair U.S.-France relations. Walking by, he replied simply, \"They\\'re great.\" The president then met with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, telling the Australian leader \"the United States has no closer and more reliable ally than Australia.\" The U.S. has helped revamp the so-called \"Quad\" dialogue -- its partnership with Australia, India and Japan -- to counter a rising China -- and Biden said that chief among the leaders\\' focus today was advancing \"our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific\" region. Biden planned to return to then Washington and host British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the White House late in the afternoon, according to the White House. Administration officials said Biden was trying to set up a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, too. Biden\\'s Tuesday morning speech kicked off a week of global engagements. The White House said Biden hoped to turn the page from conflict to global cooperation and competition. As the president implored countries to \"work together as never before,\" he tried to tamp down fears over the United States\\' increasing competition with China. The day before, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the U.S. and China to avoid a new Cold War and urged them to fix their \"completely dysfunctional relationship.\" On Tuesday, Biden told delegates -- without referencing China by name: \"We are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocks.\" He said common action was needed to deal with climate change, a crisis he noted was \"borderless.\" \"Will we meet the threat of challenging climate, the challenging climate we\\'re all feeling, already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather, or will we suffer the merciless march of ever more of ever-worsening droughts and floods, more intense fires and hurricanes, longer heat waves, and rising seas?\" he said. Biden announced he would work with Congress to try to double international public financing for developing nations to fight climate change. The end goal, with the support of other donors including private capital, would be $100 billion to help developing nations with climate change, he said. Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic has put a focus on special precautions the United Nations was taking to prevent the large, international General Assembly gathering from helping to spread the virus. The U.N. agreed to an \"enhanced cleaning\" of the main podium between leaders speeches, \"changing out microphone heads, re-routing delegations to different \\'green rooms,\\' and the use of air purifiers,\" a senior Biden administration official said. Staff could be seen swapping out the microphone head between speeches Tuesday. Bidens speech followed remarks from Brazilian Prime Minister Jair Bolsonaro, who has refused to get vaccinated, has consistently downplayed the virus\\'s seriousness and was even fined for not wearing a mask in Brazil. During his remarks, Biden sought to rally the world together to curb the pandemic, noting the world\\'s \"shared grief.\" \"We\\'ve lost so much to this devastating pandemic that continues to claim lives around the world, and impacts so much on our existence,\" he said. \"We\\'re mourning more than 4.5 million people, people of every nation, from every background. Each death is individual heartbreak.\" \"But our shared grief is a poignant reminder that our collective future will hinge on our ability to recognize our common humanity, and to act together,\" he added. On Wednesday, Biden will host a virtual summit on COVID-19 to \"rally the world urgently to work towards ending this pandemic as rapidly as possible and building our systems better to be able to handle the next pandemic,\" the White House has said. \"He believes that it is high time for the world to come together and not just national leaders,\" a senior adviser said, previewing the summit. \"But he\\'s placing a heavy emphasis on international institutions, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, all of the actors who collectively have the capacity to beat COVID-19. And he is going to call for an all-hands-on-deck effort that can end this pandemic much more rapidly than if we allow for things to unfold without the kind of focus sustained energy and effort that is required.\" The United States will also have a series of announcements about its own further contributions beyond what we\\'ve already contributed to ending the pandemic globally, according to the senior administration official. On Friday, in addition to the first in-person meeting of the Quad countries -- India, Japan, Australia and the U.S. -- in Washington, Biden planned hold individual meetings with India\\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan. ABC News\\' Justin Gomez contributed to this report.\\nA U.S. intelligence officer suffered symptoms linked to a series of directed-energy attacks known as \"Havana syndrome\" while traveling with Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns in India earlier this month WASHINGTON -- A U.S. intelligence officer suffered symptoms linked to a series of suspected directed-energy attacks known as \"Havana syndrome\" while traveling with CIA Director William Burns in India this month. Experts are in the process of verifying the officer\\'s symptoms, which are consistent with the scores of other cases in recent years linked to Havana syndrome, according to James Giordano, a scientist briefed on the case and others. CNN first reported the incident. Defense and intelligence agencies have ramped up investigations of what appears to be a rising number of incidents in which personnel have suffered symptoms consistent with being exposed to directed energy. The symptoms are often referred to as Havana syndrome because of a well-known series of cases affecting personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba beginning in 2016. The U.S. has not publicly linked the incidents to an adversary. There are at least 200 cases under investigation, half of them involving intelligence personnel. It\\'s unclear whether the officer was targeted because he was traveling with Burns, who has ordered an agency-wide review of possible attacks using microwave or other directed energy. The CIA declined to comment on the officer\\'s case, but said in a statement that Burns \"has made it a top priority to ensure officers get the care they need and that we get to the bottom of this.\" Since becoming director, Burns has tripled the number of medical staff studying incidents linked to Havana syndrome and met with agency personnel who reported cases. The incident in early September occurred just a few weeks after two possible cases of Havana syndrome delayed Vice President Kamala Harris\\' trip from Singapore to Vietnam. U.S. officials said then that it was not someone who worked for the vice president or the White House. Giordano, professor of neurology and biochemistry at Georgetown University and executive director of the Institute for Biodefense Research in Washington, said Tuesday that the intelligence officer had reported symptoms consistent with the syndrome, which generally include loss of balance, dizziness, and headaches. The officer\\'s case \"represents a clear and present threat,\" Giordano said. \"Were beginning to see a pattern of increased selective targeted use,\" he said. New reports of possible Havana syndrome cases continue to emerge both in the U.S. and abroad, including two unconfirmed incidents in the U.S. this month and a series of incidents affecting U.S. personnel in Germany several weeks prior, Giordano said.\\n\"I think it will be safe. I think it will be effective.\" Pfizer just released its first safety data about COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, reassuring parents that a safe and effective vaccine soon could be available for those younger than 12. A trial of 2,268 children showed that a smaller dose of Pfizer vaccine -- one-third the amount given to adults and adolescents -- provided robust and adequate immune responses among those ages 5 to 11. If the FDA agrees with Pfizer\\'s assessment, finally those younger than 12 can get vaccinated -- in this case, if authorized, with the smaller dosage. But that smaller dosage has led some parents to question the vaccine\\'s effectiveness compared with a larger dose. \"You\\'ve got to have a cutoff point and do something that\\'s logistically feasible,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday, speaking on CNN. \"Parents should not be confused or concerned about that.\" Other experts have stressed that size isn\\'t everything. Because the lower dose still mounts a strong and sufficient antibody response to COVID-19, even an 11-year-old who\\'s taller or weighs more than a kid over 12 should be protected. And experts involved in the Pfizer trial strongly recommend adhering to available dosage data for 5-to-11-year-olds because clinical research shows doing so is safe and effective -- a different dose would just be an educated guess. \"This is clearly an important -- very important -- first step,\" said Dr. Evan Anderson, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Emory University School of Medicine and one of the principal investigators of the Pfizer trial for children. At this point in the pandemic, more than 5 million American children -- most not eligible for vaccination -- have tested positive for COVID-19. Children make up 22.2% of the U.S. population but accounted for almost 30% of new COVID-19 cases in a single week, based on early September data compiled by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Prior clinical trials in adults and teens sought to identify a rough measure of vaccine efficacy, but because scientists already know vaccines are safe and effective, trials in younger children worked differently. Instead, this latest clinical trial focused on assessing children\\'s immune response based on analysis of their blood. These so-called immuno-bridging studies provide important information about the vaccine\\'s ability to mount immune responses for this group of children, none of whom could be vaccinated. The Pfizer data showed that the smaller dose in younger children generated antibody levels comparable to 16-to-25 year-olds who received the standard 30-microgram doses. \"Despite the smaller dose, in the smaller children, the antibody response is as vigorous as what we find in older age groups. We\\'re seeing a robust antibody response meeting [a] protective threshold,\" said Dr. Frank Esper, an infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic Children\\'s. In fact, researchers discovered that when 5-to-11-year-old children in the trial received the 30-microgram dose, they had more side effects. With the lower dosage, side effects mirrored those seen in teens and adults -- pain at the injection site, headaches and fatigue. Regardless of weight and size, children still should receive vaccine doses according to recommendations based on data, experts agreed, arguing it is better to stick to evidence rather than make an educated guess outside parameters of trials. Dr. Robert Frenck, director of the Gamble Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children\\'s and a principal investigator for the Pfizer trial, said the vaccine should not be given off-label with higher-than-recommended doses, citing the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society. \"I would stick with what the recommendation is for under 12 years of age,\" he said. \"I think it will be safe. I think it will be effective.\" Adela Wu, a neurosurgery resident at Stanford Hospital, is a contributor to the ABC News Medical Unit.\\nDebt issues plaguing Evergrande, one of China\\'s largest real estate developers, have sent shock waves of anxiety throughout global financial markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its biggest single-day drop since July on Monday, and the index closed even lower Tuesday, with many analysts attributing the precipitous fall to the Evergrande saga emanating from the nation with the second-largest gross domestic product. Jitters related to Evergrande have also been linked to a slide in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin trading 13% lower Tuesday evening compared to a week prior, as uncertainty drives investors away from riskier assets. The Evergrande crisis has even been compared to the Lehman Brothers crash that is now synonymous with the onset of the Great Recession, though many economists have cautioned against panic and directly equating the two episodes. Still, there is a reason the embattled Chinese firm has become a household name on Main Street over the past few days, and Wall Street remains on high alert over what comes next as a repayment deadline looms on Thursday. Here is what to know about the Evergrande debt crisis and its potential contagion to the global economy. What is Evergrande? Founded in 1996 in Guangzhou, Evergrande is one of the largest property development companies in China that specializes in building and selling residential apartments to the country\\'s rapidly growing middle and upper class, as well as building shopping malls and other commercial real estate projects. The company has grown quickly and developed businesses in other sectors -- including operating theme parks and manufacturing electric vehicles -- but its primary source of revenue remains in property development, according to Shang-Jin Wei, a professor of Chinese business and economy at Columbia Business School. The firm\\'s success has made its chairman, Hui Ka Yan, worth about $7.34 billion, according to Bloomberg\\'s real-time data. His net worth has fallen dramatically in recent months, however, as the company\\'s stock value plunged. In July 2020, Bloomberg estimated his net worth at nearly $40 billion. Evergrande\\'s real estate arm owns more than 1,300 projects in more than 280 cities in China, according to its website. Evergrande Group says it employs 200,000 people total and its projects create more than 3.8 million jobs per year -- leading some to suggest it has \"too big to fail\" status. The firm states it has some $350 billion in assets. What is the issue and why is it impacting global stock markets? Essentially, Evergrande\\'s rapid growth has been fueled in large part by borrowing. As demand in China\\'s once-exploding housing market wanes, fears that Evergrande could default on its estimated $300 billion in liabilities have come to a head. \"The problem in a nutshell is property development companies tend to use a lot of debt to finance their operations, and in response to rising housing prices, the Chinese government has said for quite a few years that they want to find ways to restrain the demand and restrain the housing price increases,\" Wei, who formerly served as chief economist of the Asian Development Bank, told ABC News. \"Previous attempts by the government have not been very successful, and I guess Evergrande decided that the same will happen this time,\" Wei added. \"So the last few years, while some of the property development companies have scaled down their operations, Evergrande was still charging ahead. And recently, a change in government policies has reduced demand for residential apartments quite a bit, so the company is having trouble selling apartments fast enough to meet their debt obligations.\" Wei said that the commercial housing market in China largely did not exist before 1990, when most households lived in government-assigned apartments. China\\'s meteoric economic growth since the \\'90s led to a boom in demand for housing, a wave Evergrande rode for years -- in some cases selling properties and using the funds to pay for construction costs before they were even built -- until recent policy changes by the Chinese Communist Party clamped down on such practices. Evergrande borrowed from a combination of banks and non-bank financial institutions, and issued bonds to finance its recent endeavors, according to Wei. \"When the apartments are selling well that\\'s not a problem for them, but anytime that apartment sales slow down, the company could run into trouble to meet its debt obligation and that\\'s what we are seeing now,\" Wei said. It\\'s not immediately clear how much debt Evergrande has accrued because parts of the business are not publicly traded or required to disclose financial details, Wei said, but economists estimate its liabilities are around $300 billion. While it has assets such as land and under-construction apartment complexes, Wei said it\\'s unclear if selling these could even generate enough liquidity to pay its debts. \"One of the reasons that stock markets reacted so strongly to that one firm\\'s news is uncertainty, lack of clarity,\" Wei said. \"So even though the $300 billion is the best guess, people are not exactly sure whether they undisclosed or under-disclosed the debt obligation.\" Why now? A deadline for Evergrande\\'s debt payments looms this week. In a report released earlier this week, S&P Global Ratings warned that Evergrande is \"on the brink of defaulting.\" The agency noted that the company is scheduled to make a number of interest payments on its public debt starting on Thursday, reiterating again that, \"a default is likely.\" For those paying close attention, the issues have been brewing for months. Evergrande\\'s stock, listed on the Hong Kong exchange, has shed some 80% since the beginning of the year. \"Clearly people who invest in the company understand the company was undergoing financial difficulty and there\\'s a chance that they couldn\\'t meet their obligations,\" Wei said. Recent policy changes in China to rein in the housing market -- as well as corporate debt -- have also led to Evergrande\\'s woes culminating in recent days. While it is common for property developers to take on debt as part of their business model, S&P Global warned in its report that Evergrande\\'s contracted sales have fallen more rapidly than other players in the sector -- in part because of its heavy use of of supplier commercial bills as a way to access capital. These commercial bills have a more rigid repayment date, according to S&P Global, and suppliers and contractors that have gone unpaid have filed suits against Evergrande that have ultimately resulted in halts in project construction. \"Financial institutions also appear to be quickly cutting Evergrande\\'s financing, likely as a reaction to the frequent negative news about the borrower,\" the report states. \"Without sufficient project financing, it makes even harder to sustain construction and salable resources. This is shutting down Evergrande\\'s most important source of cash flow: contracted sales of its property projects.\" Is this a \\'Lehman Brothers moment\\'? The concern for many in China and beyond is whether Evergrande\\'s failure could have a spillover effect to other firms doing business with them as well as financial markets around the globe. \"China is the second-largest economy and second-largest importer of the world. If the Chinese economy is going south, it will reduce the demand of Chinese firms for other countries\\' products,\" Wei said. China\\'s economy is also intertwined with many others in the region, he added, meaning a financial or banking crisis could easily have negative impacts beyond its borders. \"These are the reason for why the U.S. and elsewhere we\\'ve see our stock market respond to news about a Chinese company,\" he added. \"Now is this response justified or is it an overreaction? That depends on two things -- one is does Evergrande actually constitute a systematic risk for the Chinese economy? And two is, if it does, can the Chinese government manage to contain the risk?\" S&P Global stated in its report that it does not expect \"government actions to help Evergrande unless systemic stability is at risk.\" \"A government bailout would undermine the campaign to instill greater financial discipline in the property sector,\" the researchers stated. \"Government support to prevent a default is only likely if contagion risks cause other large developers to fail.\" The agency said it believes a hit to the financial system from Evergrande alone will be \"manageable\" and that Beijing\\'s focus would be to \"ease Evergrande through an orderly debt restructuring or bankruptcy process that maximizes the value of its substantial assets.\" Rather than a \"bailout,\" it foresees the government facilitating negotiations to ensure individual investors and homebuyers are protected. Tommy Wu, an economist with Oxford Economics, similarly stated in a Tuesday report, \"While we think the government doesn\\'t want to be seen as engineering a bail out, we expect it to step in to conduct a managed restructuring of the firm\\'s debt to prevent disorderly debt recovery efforts, reduce systemic risk, and contain economic disruption.\" If this restructuring plan works, Wu writes that they expect the implications for overall economic policy and outlook to \"remain contained,\" though the property sector will likely remain tense for some time and some spillover into the wider financial sector is likely. Brad McMillan, the chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said Americans should not panic about a so-called \"Lehman Brothers moment\" just yet in a memo shared with ABC News on Tuesday. \"Despite the worry, so far this looks like a corporate bankruptcy and not something worse,\" McMillan said. \"It\\'s a big one, to be sure, but one that can be handled within the system. Bondholders will lose money, other companies will be affected, and life will move on. So far, that situation is what we see and not something bigger.\" Even if it does evolve into something larger, McMillan noted that the Chinese government \"has more money -- and more legal powers -- to contain the damage than the U.S. and western governments did back in 2008.\" Moreover, McMillan argues the Chinese financial system and the rest of the world are less integrated than in 2008, meaning the \"contagion possibilities are simply more limited.\" Ultimately, \"the bus that you are watching is rarely the one that ends up hitting you,\" McMillan adds. \"Both the U.S. government and regulators, and U.S. banks and financial institutions, are very aware of the situation in China, and they are at least thinking about how to minimize the risks,\" he said. \"That was not the case in 2008. Since this is not coming out of the blue, any damage will be contained -- and likely much less than is now feared.\" Why is this impacting cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies have seen meteoric growth in recent years, and have emerged as especially popular among retail investors. Crypto markets have seen a dip in recent days amid the Evergrande headlines, but the digital currencies have also been notoriously volatile and prone to wide and seemingly sudden swings in prices. \"In opaque crises like the one now afflicting China\\'s Evergrande real estate conglomerate, it\\'s less \\'what you know\\' than \\'what you know you don\\'t know\\' that drives financial volatility,\" Robert Hockett, a professor of law at Cornell University whose research focuses in part on financial and monetary law, told ABC News via email. \"In these cases of opacity-fueled fear, assets described by the word \\'crypto\\' can be expected to take the worst hits in the asset fire sales that accompany conflagration much as did those more euphemistically called \\'subprime\\' 13 years ago.\" Bitcoin, Ethereum and others are \"accordingly finding themselves hardest hit right now -- even more than the more traditional speculative firms like Goldman,\" he added. \"They are, in effect, the new canaries in the current financial coal mine,\" Hockett said.\\nThe three children were waiting for a bus when they were shot in a drive-by. No arrests have been made after a 16-year-old boy was killed and two other children were hurt in a shooting at a school bus stop in Louisville, Kentucky, according to local police. The three children were waiting for a bus when they were shot in a drive-by at about 6:30 a.m. local time Wednesday, police said. One of the injured kids, a 14-year-old boy, suffered non-life-threatening injuries, police said. The other survivor, a 14-year-old girl, was treated for minor injuries at the scene, police said. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives identified the slain teen as 16-year-old Tyree Smith. Jefferson County Public Schools Superintendent Marty Pollio said all three victims are students at Eastern High School. The school bus arrived shortly after the \"traumatic\" slaying, Pollio said, and a bus stop for middle schoolers was close by. Police initially said they were looking for a grey Jeep that was reportedly in the area at the time of the shooting. On Thursday, police said the vehicle was recovered and asked anyone with information to call the authorities. This marked Louisville\\'s 145th homicide of the year, officials said. Louisville Metropolitan Police Chief Erika Shields called it a \"heinous crime.\" Shields said the city is tackling gun violence and \"getting violent felons off the street daily.\" However, she added, \"the availability of illegal guns is just so widespread. \"\\nA broken power-sharing deal, the lingering possibility of a Republican walkout and a COVID-19 case are adding greater uncertainty to whether Oregon legislators will successfully redraw the states political districts ahead of a tight deadline A broken power-sharing deal, the lingering possibility of a Republican walkout and a COVID-19 case are adding greater uncertainty to whether Oregon legislators will successfully redraw the states political districts ahead of a tight deadline. Stakes are high as Oregon gained a new, sixth U.S. House seat following the latest census. Lawmakers were told the House would reconvene in Salem Wednesday morning following news Tuesday that someone in the building had tested positive for COVID-19. But House Speaker Tina Kotek now says the chamber wont convene until Saturday to give time for those exposed to the coronavirus case to be tested and receive results. Democrats say their entire caucus in the House has been vaccinated. The number of Oregon\\'s vaccinated Republican lawmakers was not immediately available. When the House reconvenes on Saturday lawmakers will have just two days to vote on and pass new political boundaries before a Sept. 27 deadline. If congressional maps are not passed by that deadline, the task will fall to a panel of five retired judges appointed by the Oregon Supreme Court. But who will return to the Capitol when the House doors reopen remains in question. Following the decision of Kotek, a Democrat, to rescind a power-sharing deal to redraw political maps that she made with the House GOP, House Republican Leader Christine Drazan told The Associated Press on Wednesday that a GOP walkout is \"on the table.\" \"The Democrats can choose a walkout or the Democrats can choose to advance maps that are fair to Oregonians,\" Drazan said. If Republicans dont go to the floor of the House the chamber wont have a quorum -- meaning lawmakers wouldnt be able to proceed with business. Both parties have used walkouts -- a tool made available by the Oregon Constitution -- in the past, with Republicans relying on it in recent years. Most notably in 2019, when Republicans used it to stop a cap-and-trade bill. In exchange for Republicans to stop blocking bills with delaying tactics during the 2021 legislative session, the House Speaker had said she would evenly split the House Redistricting Committee -- essentially granting veto power to the GOP over any proposed map. Koteks announcement to pull back from the deal on Monday left Republicans furious, as it now gives Democrats a powerful advantage to pass maps they choose -- likely resulting in five of the U.S. House seats being blue to Republicans\\' one. Currently, Democrats hold four of Oregons five House seats. \"She lied and broke her promise not just to us but to Oregonians,\" Republican Leader Christine Drazan said in a statement about Kotek. In a statement, Kotek said she was \"disappointed that after many months of work, House Republicans did not engage constructively despite many attempts to address their concerns\" and lead to her decision to void the standing deal. The Senate passed maps on Saturday, without Republican support. Those maps also need to be voted on in the House. Drazan said she is continuing to have conversations with House Democrats about amending the proposed maps. \"I am talking to two folks across the aisle,\" she said. \"Now, the question becomes will they will they want to change approach? I dont know.\" In addition to the six congressional districts, lawmakers are also responsible for passing 90 legislative districts which determines how voters pick state representatives and state senators. If the legislative maps are not passed by Monday, the task will fall to Secretary of State Shemia Fagan, a progressive Democrat who few Republicans would want to see in charge of that process ------ Cline is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Despite the warnings, officials say preparations for the migrant surge only began when large waves started showing up this week. Now the Biden administration is scrambling to track, process and remove those gathered under an international bridge in the South Texas town of Del Rio that at one point ballooned to more than 14,000. In one email to Del Rio sector management dated June 1, members of the National Border Patrol Council expressed the need for additional measures to process migrants in the field in the event that facilities became overwhelmed. Agents offered specific suggestions including the use of digital tablets to allow for early initiation of the migrant intake process immediately after encounters with Customs and Border Protection. In a second email days later, the Del Rio agents went so far as to ensure the tablets had wireless data capabilities with the right network provider so they could be used along the international boundary line. The emails were sent to Del Rio Sector Border Patrol management, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security. Management responded weeks later to the June emails with a single line in red typeface: \"This is being explored, several other platforms are being considered which are more efficient.\" \"The agency did indeed consider the tablets, but it never materialized into anything of substance,\" said Jon Anfinsen, National Border Patrol Council vice president. \"As the months went on, the groups continued to increase in size and frequency, but the temporary facilities are only now starting to come online over the past few days, after things had already spun out of control.\" Anfinsen said the groundwork for the migrant surge only began last week as the border became overwhelmed. Asked by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul on Wednesday about the emails, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said his Department does track migration in Central and South America but that the rate at which this group came together at the border was unprecedented. \"We watch the flow of individuals who are seeking to migrate irregularly through Mexico from the Northern Triangle countries, and further south we do indeed track it,\" Mayorkas said. \"And nevertheless, congressman, as I previously articulated the speed with which this materialized is unprecedented.\" \"Did you see this threat coming? And if so -- what if anything did you do?\" McCaul pressed. \"We have not seen before such a rapid migration -- irregular migration -- of individuals as we have observed and experienced with respect to the Haitians who have crossed the border in Del Rio, Texas,\" Mayorkas said. \"That has been an unprecedented speed.\" The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request to comment on the email exchange. U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to comment. There were other early warning signs, including reports of large migrant groups moving into Panama in the early weeks of summer. Panama\\'s foreign minister was concerned about the mounting pressure after the country\\'s migration division reported a 477% increase in border crossings between January and April, according to a June report from Bloomberg. Haitian migrants have been leaving the island nation in large numbers since a massive earthquake in January 2010 killed hundreds of thousands of people. Many moved to Brazil and Chile, but have faced a lack of economic stability and security in South America. Arrests at the border have neared record levels over the summer. CBP has made more than 1.5 million arrests or detentions so far this budget year. Immigration officials point out a significant portion, sometimes as much as a third, of those arrests involve repeat offenders and the administration has taken steps to send migrants further into the interior of Mexico to prevent recidivism. Haiti has been devastated by natural disasters and political unrest with two major earthquakes in roughly the past decade. The first in 2010 sent thousands seeking refuge in South America. A less expansive, but still deadly, earthquake last month killed more than 2,200. But this most recent quake occurred after the July 29 deadline set by the Biden administration for any Haitians to receive refuge in the U.S.\\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday worked to salvage his sweeping legislative agenda as Democratic infighting imperiled his ambitious goals on infrastructure, climate change and Americans\\' relationship with government into peril. The president planned to host a series of Democratic congressional leaders and factions at the White House, with the goal of pushing two pieces of legislation to the finish line: the bipartisan $1.2 trillion physical infrastructure bill that already passed the Senate but faces challenges in the House, and a potentially much larger bill with hundreds of billions of dollars for \"human infrastructure\" -- funding for child care, eldercare, universal preschool, free community college, combating climate change, and a host of other Democratic priorities. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters late Tuesday that she intends to put the bipartisan infrastructure bill on the floor next week -- as early as Monday -- for consideration, but it\\'s unclear if and when the lower chamber will vote on the bill. Pelosi and Democratic leadership have urged their entire caucus to support the bill, despite the fact that the $3.5 trillion bill is still weeks away from completion and progressives have said they won\\'t support the bipartisan bill unless the larger social bill is passed. Historically, Pelosi is loath to put a bill on the floor that will fail, so leadership must decide soon how they intend to play this. Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who met with Pelosi on Tuesday for 90 minutes in her office and is expected to meet with Biden later Wednesday -- told ABC News that more than half of her caucus, which stands at nearly 100 members, is ready to tank the bipartisan infrastructure bill if the larger progressive bill isn\\'t ready by next week. Meanwhile, moderate Democrats in both houses of Congress oppose some specific items in the larger bill -- which Biden calls his \"Build Back Better agenda\" -- as well as its overall price tag. They\\'ve threatened to tank that bill if significant changes aren\\'t made to it -- changes the progressives adamantly oppose. \"Our belief is that it\\'s not, it\\'s not a random number, it\\'s about what we are putting into the bill and what we\\'re willing to take out. So if there are people who say they want a smaller bill, are they going to take out childcare or are they going to take out housing or are they going to take out climate change efforts? What is it that we\\'re going to take out? For us, it\\'s never been a $3.5 trillion bill. It\\'s a $0 bill, because there was plenty of money to pay for the entire thing,\" Jayapal told ABC News. With his agenda at risk, Biden hosted Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer Wednesday afternoon, followed by Democratic moderates from both chambers -- including Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who have expressed opposition to the larger spending bill. Later in the afternoon, he planned to meet with Jayapal and other progressives from both the House and Senate, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the White House said. Returning from the White House later Wednesday, Pelosi told reporters that Democrats\\' plan to hold the physical infrastructure bill vote early next week was still \"on schedule.\" \"We are calm and everybody\\'s good and our work is almost done,\" she said, when asked about the larger bill. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega that it was not a make-or-break moment for Biden\\'s spending proposals. \"I would never describe it that way,\" Psaki said Wednesday. \"But I would say, look, this is an important moment where we\\'re in the pivotal period of our negotiations and discussions.\" Psaki said Biden was holding three separate meetings -- rather than one -- because \"this is a messy sausage-making process.\" She said he \"sees his role as uniting and as working to bring together people.\" \"The president\\'s bringing people of a range of viewpoints on big, important packages that are going to make their lives better here to the White House to have a discussion about it,\" she said. \"He\\'s rolling up his sleeves. He\\'s walking them to the Oval Office, he\\'ll have some COVID-safe snacks.\" Late Tuesday night, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he hoped Biden was \"the secret sauce.\" \"The president of the United States is always a very influential figure, and I know he wants both bills passed,\" Hoyer told reporters. Biden senior adviser Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, traveled to the Hill to meet with House Democrats Wednesday afternoon, too. Manchin has said for months he believes there should be a \"strategic pause\" before Congress takes up the reconciliation bill, citing his concerns about spending. His opposition to the price tag runs in tandem with Sinema. Either one of them could tank the progressive bill from becoming law. Separately, progressives are insisting that a pathway to citizenship is included in the bill. The Senate parliamentarian dealt a blow to Democrats late Sunday after ruling that immigration reform does not have a direct budgetary impact and therefor could not be included in the reconciliation bill. Schumer and other Democrats expressed deep disappointment and vowed to continue fighting for new pathways to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. The messy legislative fight carries high stakes with next year\\'s midterms looming and the president hoping to chalk up a major win Democrats can point to as his approval sags after a much criticized withdrawal from Afghanistan and amid the continuing coronavirus pandemic. John Podesta, an influential Democrat who served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, sent a memorandum to the office of every Democratic member of Congress on Tuesday, warning them to pare back the $3.5 trillion bill -- or risk losing control of Congress. Podesta said he \"wholeheartedly\" supported that bill -- and actually thought it should \"do even more\" -- but that \"the political reality is clear\" and that Democrats \"will not secure the full $3.5 trillion investment.\" He called on Democrats to unite, saying progressives should accept a smaller price tag, and that moderates must swallow the other package in addition to the physical infrastructure deal they support. Doing nothing, he said, would fail Americans and could mean the end of Democratic control on Capitol Hill. \"It would signal a complete and utter failure of our democratic duty, and a reckless abdication of our responsibility,\" Podesta wrote. Meanwhile, Biden must also contend with a looming possible government shutdown on Oct. 1. Democrats in the House passed a short-term spending bill late Tuesday that would punt the shutdown fight to Dec. 3. The legislation also provides billions in aid for emergency disaster relief and Afghan evacuees. It also suspends the debt limit to December 2022. But Senate Republicans have vowed to block any legislation that would lift or suspend the debt limit. Senate Republicans say they oppose suspending the debt limit because of additional spending measures Democrats are currently crafting -- even though the debt limit does not authorize new spending and is instead paying off previous debt, much of it incurred during the Trump administration. Senate Democrats have countered that they have lifted the debt limit with Republicans under the Trump administration on multiple occasions and say it\\'s a bipartisan responsibility. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said if Congress does not act to raise the debt limit, the U.S. could default on its debt sometime in October, potentially triggering an \"economic catastrophe.\" Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said for weeks they will oppose any measure that raises the debt ceiling, insisting that Democrats can do it alone given their control over all three branches of government. \"Since Democrats decided to go it alone, they will not get Senate Republicans\\' help with raising the debt limit. I\\'ve explained this clearly and consistently for over two months,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor earlier this week. Biden has often touted the deal-making skills he honed over decades in the Senate, and the next few days will put his abilities to the test.\\nLuchiano Lewis, who was 14 at the time, was charged as an adult. A 16-year-old boy charged in connection with the 2019 stabbing death of Barnard College student Tessa Majors pleaded guilty to second-degree murder Tuesday in Manhattan Criminal Court. Luchiano Lewis, who was charged as an adult, was 14 when he and two other teenagers were accused in the fatal stabbing of 18-year-old Majors during a mugging gone wrong on Dec. 11, 2019, in Manhattan\\'s Morningside Park, near Barnard College. Majors, a freshman at the school, was stabbed several times before she staggered up a flight of stairs and uttered, \"Help me, I\\'m being robbed,\" authorities said. Lewis also pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery Tuesday. Lewis appeared in court in a dark suit and tie and raced through an allocution in which he said he saw feathers emerge from Majors\\' winter coat but did not realize she had been stabbed, let alone killed, until the next morning when he recognized her on the news as the young woman he and the others tried to rob. The family of Majors sat in the front row and listened to Lewis explain how the trio of middle school friends plotted to rob people in the park. He pinned the idea on 16-year-old Rashaun Weaver, who has pleaded not guilty. A 13-year-old juvenile has pleaded guilty and is serving his sentence. \"He wanted the three of us to do robberies in Morningside Park,\" Lewis said of Weaver. \"I assumed Rashaun had a knife on him, but using a knife was not part of our plan.\" Lewis will be sentenced Oct. 14, at which point Majors\\' family plans to make a statement in court, prosecutors said. \"Are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty?\" asked Judge Robert Mandelbaum. \"Yes,\" Lewis replied. Police and prosecutors have said Weaver wielded the knife and Lewis guessed he \"threw it in the sewer\" after the murder. \"This was not a premeditated murder as we heard inside,\" Jeffrey Lichtman, the noted criminal defense attorney who is representing Weaver, said outside court. \"These were 14- and a 13-year-old boys and we should remember that.\" Following the second guilty plea in the case, the family of Majors thanked the Manhattan District Attorney\\'s Office and the New York City Police Department \"for their tireless and thorough efforts.\" \"We remain resolute in our belief that all parties who bear responsibility for Tess\\'s senseless death will be held accountable, and we are deeply grateful to the many people who continue to pursue that goal,\" the family said in a statement to ABC News.\\nIt now heads to the Senate where it\\'s expected to be blocked. The House voted along party lines to pass a short-term funding bill to avert a government shutdown next week. The final vote was 220-211. The bill would fund the government through Dec. 3 and it also includes billions in emergency disaster relief and aid for Afghan evacuees. It also suspends the debt limit through December 2022. Senate Republicans are expected to block the measure later this week because they do not want to vote on raising the debt limit -- which means a shutdown could still happen if funding runs out after midnight on Sept. 30. Democrats need 10 Republican senators to vote with them, and as of right now, the votes are not there. The path forward to avert a shutdown is unclear as of right now. Senate Republicans have said they oppose suspending the debt limit because of additional spending measures Democrats are crafting -- even though doing so would pay for previous expenditures. But Senate Democrats worked with Republicans under the Trump administration to raise the debt limit on multiple occasions and said it\\'s a bipartisan responsibility. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said if Congress does not act to raise the debt limit, the U.S. could default on its debt sometime in October, potentially triggering an \"economic catastrophe.\" Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said for weeks they will oppose any measure that raises the debt ceiling, insisting that Democrats can do it alone given their control over all three branches of government. \"Since Democrats decided to go it alone, they will not get Senate Republicans\\' help with raising the debt limit. I\\'ve explained this clearly and consistently for over two months,\" McConnell said Monday on the Senate floor. But Democrats are pressing ahead and remain optimistic about the bill\\'s prospects, knowing full well the challenge they face in getting Republicans on board. \"It is our hope that Senate Republicans will also do the right thing and stop playing politics around the debt limit,\" House Democratic caucus chair Hakeem Jeffries said at a press conference Tuesday. Jeffries indicated that at least a handful of Republicans have publicly expressed they will end up voting for the bill. Democrats need at least 10 Republicans in the Senate to back the bill. \"Three times -- during the administration of the former president -- three times House Democrats cooperated in raising the debt ceiling,\" Jeffries said. \"Now all of a sudden, they want to jam up the American people and the American economy and our full faith and credit, because they\\'re playing politics?\" Jeffries said of Republicans in the Senate. \"Senate Republicans should be hearing from their friends in the big banks and big business, as to how catastrophic a default on our debt would be for industry, for commerce, for the economy and most importantly for the American people,\" Jeffries added. Without GOP support, it\\'s unclear how Democrats will plan to tackle the issue of raising or suspending the debt limit alone. \"The debt limit is a shared responsibility, and I urge Congress to come together, in that spirit, on a bipartisan basis as it has in the past to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter to members over the weekend. The short-term funding bill unveiled on Tuesday extends funding through Dec. 3 for all vital federal agencies, including health, housing, education and public safety programs. \"It is critical that Congress swiftly pass this legislation to support critical education, health, housing and public safety programs and provide emergency help for disaster survivors and Afghan evacuees,\" House Appropriations Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro said in a statement Tuesday. The bill also includes $28.6 billion in emergency disaster relief to address recent natural disasters, including multiple hurricanes and wildfires, severe droughts and winter storms in 2021 and prior years. Another $6.3 billion would support Afghan evacuees, including funding to temporarily house evacuees at American facilities and in foreign countries, provide necessary security screenings and ultimately resettle eligible evacuees in the United States. The legislation also includes funding to provide humanitarian assistance for Afghan refugees in neighboring countries. The legislation suspends the debt limit through December 2022.\\nProgressives had threatened to tank the measure over the military support. House Democrats on Tuesday removed $1 billion in funding for Israel\\'s Iron Dome air defense system from their stopgap government funding bill, after progressives threatened to tank the measure over the military support for Israel. While Democratic leaders committed to approving the funding by year\\'s end in another must-pass bill, the holdup was the latest episode in an ongoing intraparty debate over support for Israel. Republicans quickly took to social media to accuse Democrats of undermining Israel\\'s security. They also planned a procedural vote to highlight Democrats\\' divisions -- which was rejected -- even as they had planned to vote against the initial measure when it included Iron Dome funding. Moderate Democrats also criticized their colleagues for opposing the funds for the defensive missile system, which President Joe Biden promised to replenish after Israel\\'s conflict with the Palestinian militant group Hamas in May. While lawmakers from both parties have supported Israel\\'s right to defend itself unconditionally for decades, a growing group of Democratic lawmakers have called on party leaders to revisit its relationship with Israel, and have accused its military of human rights abuses and blasted the treatment of Palestinians. That tension has been exacerbated in recent years by the efforts of conservative Israeli leaders -- most notably former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- to align closely with Republicans and former President Donald Trump, after tensions with the Obama administration over the U.S. nuclear negotiations with Iran. Still, Democratic Party leaders and Biden have been quick to demonstrate their support for Israel. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on Tuesday spoke to Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid about the Iron Dome funding debate and reiterated Democrats\\' commitment to passing the measure. Hoyer said the funding would be on the floor by the end of the week.\\nA Kentucky man pardoned by President Donald Trump after his conviction in a 2012 bribery plot has been charged again with campaign-related crimes, this time involving a 2016 illegal campaign contribution scheme WASHINGTON -- A Republican political operative pardoned by President Donald Trump after his conviction in a 2012 bribery plot has been charged again with campaign-related crimes, this time involving a 2016 illegal campaign contribution scheme and a Russian national. Jesse Benton, 43, of Louisville, Kentucky, was accused in an indictment unsealed Monday in federal court in Washington. Trump pardoned Benton in December after his conviction in a case involving false records and campaign reports to the Federal Election Commission. Prosecutors said Benton and two others who were working on the 2012 presidential campaign of Ron Paul tried to hide $73,000 in payments to an Iowa state senator, Kent Sorenson, for his endorsement of Paul. The most recent case is similar in nature to the 2012 charges. Benton, who was the former chief strategist for the pro-Trump Great America PAC, and Roy Douglas \"Doug\" Wead, who served as an adviser to multiple presidential campaigns and is a presidential historian and author, were accused of conspiracy to solicit and cause an illegal campaign contribution by a Russian foreign national during the 2016 presidential election. Both men appeared in court Monday. Bentons attorney did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Wead attorney Jay Sekulow said Wead pleaded not guilty. According to court papers, Wead, 75, of Bonita Springs, Florida, told a Russian foreign national that he could meet an unnamed presidential candidate at a political event in exchange for a contribution. It is illegal to solicit campaign contributions from foreigners. The indictment does not specify which presidential candidate, but at the time of the event noted in the indictment, Sept. 22, 2016, there were only two major party candidates, Republican Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump had a fundraiser in Pittsburgh on Sept. 22. Benton has long been involved in Republican politics. Wead is a conservative commentator and author who served in the White House of George H.W. Bush and wrote a book, \"Inside Trumps White House: The Real Story of His Presidency,\" that he described as an authorized history of the president\\'s first years in office. After the unnamed donor committed to transfer the funds, Benton arranged for the Russian national to attend a political fundraising event and get a photo in exchange for $100,000 in donations to a political consulting firm owned by Benton, the indictment says. The indictment said that the men later disguised the funds by creating a fake invoice. According to the indictment, Benton then told two political committees affiliated with the candidate that he\\'d sent the promised contribution, eventually using a personal credit card to make a $25,000 donating and keeping the rest. Unknowingly, the political committees filed reports with the election commission that wrongly stated that Benton was the source of that donation, the indictment read. Benton and Wead were both charged with conspiracy to solicit and cause an illegal campaign contribution by a foreign national, effect a conduit contribution, and cause false records to be filed with the Federal Election Commission. ------ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker and Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.\\nJust three weeks into the criminal trial of Elizabeth Holmes, jurors have already heard allegations of lies, deception and alleged intimidation from those who worked directly under her -- and the trial is expected to continue into December. \"I was scared that things would not go well,\" one former Theranos scientist, Surekha Gangakhedkar, told prosecutors when asked why she made copies of internal communications and documents before resigning from the company. \"I was also worried that I would be blamed.\" A full recap of last week\\'s proceedings is available on today\\'s episode of \"The Dropout: Elizabeth Holmes on Trial\" free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Music, or wherever you listen to podcasts. Theranos was founded by Holmes in 2003. The company claimed to be developing blood testing technology that used only small droplets of blood. Nearly two decades later, Holmes is defending herself against charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud stemming from a \"multi-million-dollar scheme to defraud investors, and a separate scheme to defraud doctors and patients,\" according to prosecutors. Gangakhedkar and Erika Cheung, two former Theranos scientists, testified under oath last week. They both conveyed the same information to the jury: Theranos\\' Edison devices -- their blood testing machines -- rarely functioned properly. Cheung told the court that Theranos would frequently cherry-pick data, deleting \"any two data points that would not hit the metrics we needed.\" She added that in March of 2014, about one in every four Theranos tests failed. Cheung was one of the whistleblowers who first leaked information about Theranos to the Wall Street Journal in 2015. ABC News interviewed Cheung in the first season of \"The Dropout.\" \"Our quality controls were failing at one point ... what seemed [like] almost every day,\" Cheung told ABC News in 2019. Gangakhedkar was the former manager of assay systems at Theranos and reported directly to Holmes. She told the jury that she didn\\'t think Theranos\\' devices \"were ready to be used for patient samples.\" Prosecutors presented several emails from 2013, in which Gangakhedkar reported the results of numerous failed tests on the Edison devices to Holmes directly. At the time, Theranos testing centers had already gone live in some Walgreens stores. When prosecutors asked Gangakhedkar where this pressure to move forward before Theranos was ready came from, she swiftly responded \"from Ms. Holmes.\" Holmes\\' defense has only just begun to question Gangakhedkar and will continue Tuesday. The court granted Gangakhedkar full criminal immunity before she took the witness stand. She told the court she took documents with her upon her departure from the company, despite her non-disclosure agreement, \"to protect myself and to have as a record in the event issues came up in the future.\" At the time Cheung was speaking with an investigative reporter in 2015, she believed she was being followed by people hired by Theranos. Soon after she started another job, she told jurors she was served a letter by an unknown individual at an address not many in her circle were aware of. The jury was shown the letter, addressed from the firm Boies Schiller Flexner, and claimed she had disclosed Theranos\\' \"trade secrets and other confidential information without authorization.\" Recent Theranos financial documents made public via Holmes\\' trial show the company paid $150,000 to private investigators for a project titled \"E. Cheung & T. Schultz project.\" Tyler Schultz was another Theranos whistleblower speaking with an investigative journalist at the time. This week, Gangakhedkar will conclude her testimony.   Dan Edlin was once Theranos\\' senior project manager and one of many friends recruited to the company by Holmes\\' brother, Christian. Holmes and her counsel did not respond to ABC News\\' repeated requests for comment. Editor\\'s note: This report has been edited from its original version.

A mounting crisis is unfolding at the U.S.-Mexico border where thousands of migrants, many from Haiti, have trekked across dozens of countries, facing blistering heat and other dangers to seek refuge in the United States. But entering the land of the free has proved difficult after migrants waded across the border. They were met by Border Patrol agents and deportation efforts. All eyes are on the small town of Del Rio, Texas, where at one point more than 14,000 migrants, the majority from Haiti, were sheltering under a bridge. One of the migrants, Jean Baptiste Wilvens, told ABC News he crossed 11 countries to get to the U.S. after he and his family had been living in Chile for the last four years. \"I\\'m scared to go back there because right now I cannot live in my country,\" he said. His pregnant wife and 10-year-old daughter are now back on the Mexican side of the border. He said they had made it to the U.S. camp but called it \"hell.\" On the U.S. side, Wilvens said they were only given a burrito and a bottle of water per day, but in Mexico, several people came to the camp to give away food, which some migrants got into a fight over. The mayor of Del Rio, Bruno Lozano, called the scenes unfolding,\"heartbreaking.\" \"The fact that they\\'re putting their lives at risk is telling of the situation that they come from,\" he said. Like so many migrants who arrive at the U.S.\\' southern border, the current wave has come from Central or South America. Many of them are Haitian refugees who left their country after the 2010 earthquake. \"For a variety of reasons, perhaps mostly economic, the economy suffered with COVID, we have seen them migrate up over the last few months to our southern border,\" said Elizabeth Neuman, a former Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary and ABC News contributor. Now, the world watches to see how the Biden administration handles the influx. For years after the 2010 earthquake, Haitians living inside the U.S. had been granted temporary protected status. The Trump administration let that designation expire. However, after the assassination of Haitian President Jovenal Moise in July and another devastating earthquake earlier in August, the Biden administration restored that special status to Haitians. \"While that TPS is only applicable for people that are already here in the United States, that might have given the Haitian community hope that if they somehow got into the United States, maybe they could take advantage of that TPS as well,\" Neumann said. Some of the migrants have claimed asylum and are awaiting the immigration process inside the U.S., but many have already been loaded onto planes and deported back to Haiti. The Biden administration says one to three flights are leaving a day removing migrants who do not have a valid claim to stay in the U.S. based on Title 42, a Trump-era law prohibiting migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S., citing COVID concerns. \"If you come to the United States illegally, you will be returned. Your journey will not succeed, and you will be endangering your life and your family\\'s lives,\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a Monday press conference. \"Title 42 is actually not immigration law as much as it is public health law that allows an emergency to be declared and basically the borders to be closed,\" Neumann said. \"A year ago, you could definitely see the case. We did not have vaccines. We did not have a robust testing capability. We have those things now.\" However, unaccompanied minors, and many families are exempt from Title 42. Still, migrant advocates like Guerline Jozef with the Haitian Bridge Alliance say that\\'s not enough. \"Title 42 should not be used as a way to trap migrants, as a way to trap asylum seekers,\" she said. \"Why can\\'t we make sure they are tested, they are vaccinated and provide them the access? Jozef said. On Capitol Hill, some lawmakers have called for the end of the use of Title 42. \"I urge President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas to immediately put a stop to these expulsions and to end this Title 42 policy at our southern border,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday on the Senate floor. Now, many migrants are living in fear of being sent back to Haiti after their exhaustive and perilous journeys. One migrant named Josef, a social studies school teacher and father of three who didn\\'t want to share his last name, told Nightline he crossed 10 countries to get to the U.S. to give his children the chance at a better life. \"When I saw that my child would not get the education that I wanted, I had to think that maybe the U.S., as a superpower, could give me some wisdom, and that my child could get social protection, a protection for education,\" Josef said. Wilvens compared how the U.S. has welcomed Afghan refugees, but is turning away Haitians. \"The U.S. gives nearly 30,000 Afghans the ability to be refugees in the U.S. but Haitians are deported. Why is that?\" Wilvens said. Neumann said that \"we have a debt that we owe the Afghan people,\" with the withdrawal of American troops in wake of the swift Taliban takeover and end of 10-year war in Afghanistan. \"There is a slightly different sentiment for those trying to reach us from the Southern Hemisphere. And I think that it\\'s a good question for us to ask ourselves why,\" she said. Harrowing images from the border have emerged over the past week showing border patrol agents on horseback aggressively attempting to push back migrants as they cross the Rio Grande into the U.S. One image showed an agent on horseback grabbing a man by the back of his shirt. \"As I saw this, this image brought me back to slavery,\" Jozef with the Haitian Bridge Alliance said, overcome with emotion. \"As a Black woman, as a descendant of slaves, as a woman from Haiti whose forefathers and ancestors fought to end slavery, fought for freedom of all Black people, it is painful because we keep on being reminded that our lives do not matter, our pain [does] not matter,\" she said. U.S. Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz initially defended the agents, saying, \"We do not know who are the smugglers or who are the migrants. So it\\'s important that the Border Patrol agents maintain a level of security,\" during a press conference Monday. Homeland Security later slammed the video as \"extremely troubling,\" saying a \"full investigation, which will be conducted swiftly, will define the appropriate disciplinary actions.\" President Joe Biden said he found the videos of tactics used by Border Patrol agents on horseback against Haitian migrants at the Texas border \"horrific and horrible,\" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. But, Biden doubled down on the handling of the chaos at the border. \"We will get it under control,\" he said when asked about the crisis by reporters at the United Nations headquarters Tuesday. Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the treatment of migrants at the border on Tuesday saying, \"Human beings should never be treated that way. I was deeply troubled by it.\" Meanwhile, the Del Rio mayor said of the images, \"We don\\'t know the situation that came out that caused that, that contrast to happen, but I can tell you what I\\'ve seen is, it\\'s been a humanitarian effort of proportions that I\\'ve never seen in my life.\" The union representing Border Patrol agents defended the images, arguing that\\'s part of their training. DHS says it now has agency monitors on the ground at the border to make sure policies are being followed. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott visited Del Rio Tuesday and asked the Biden administration for an emergency declaration. \"These border patrol officers are overwhelmed with the amount of work they are ordered to do and they\\'re suffering the consequences of an administration that is not providing either the personnel or the resources they need,\" he said. Neumann said she hopes the crisis will lead to \"public pressure on Congress to once and for all address things that we are now on four presidents that have been trying to address this.\" \"We\\'ve got to fix it because the problem is just going to get worse,\" she said. \"These are human beings that deserve to be treated better than we\\'re capable of treating them today.\" Jozef with the Haitian Bridge Alliance said people are coming to the border as a last resort. \"Because they are in need of protection, because they are dying, because they need support,\" she said. Their desire for a better life often makes them vulnerable to smugglers and coyotes who have been known to charge migrants anywhere up to $15,000 per person to take them over the border, she said. \"If those people haven\\'t had an avenue to properly present themselves to want to seek asylum, there would be no need for them to be engaged with those coyotes, to be engaged with those human traffickers, frankly, to be engaged with people who do not have their best interests at heart,\" Jozef added. For families like those of Haitian school teacher Josef, making this treacherous journey for a chance at a better life is one of the last options they have left. \"I went through all these dangers with my family, my wife and my children, because the United States, I think, it\\'s the last journey for us to make our dreams come true,\" Josef said.\\nBut he failed to mention his goal of 70% global vaccination rate by next fall. President Joe Biden on Wednesday gathered world leaders virtually to discuss a plan for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 4 million people globally, announcing the U.S. would donate another half billion doses of Pfizer vaccine to lower-income nations. The White House\\'s stated goal for the summit, happening at the same time as the U.N. General Assembly, was to get world leaders to commit to increasing vaccination rates, making live-saving measures more widely available globally and aligning global targets for fighting the pandemic. Despite the fact that White House officials told reporters Tuesday night that Biden would call on world leaders to commit to reaching a 70% vaccination goal by September 2022, he did not mention the goal in his opening remarks, and the White House has yet to achieve a 70% vaccination rate across the U.S., despite the wide availability of vaccines for months. \"This summit is about supercharging our efforts in three key areas: vaccinating the world by dramatically ramping up vaccine production, donations, delivery and administering the vaccine which is a logistical challenge,\" Biden said. Biden committed American resources to tackle those logistical problems and ramp up vaccinations. \"The United States is buying another half billion doses of Pfizer to donate to low- and middle-income countries around the world. This is another half a billion doses that will all be shipped by this time next year, and it brings our total commitment of donations -- of donated vaccines to over 1.1 billion vaccines to be donated.\" Biden made a point of thanking Pfizer CEO, Albert Bourla, lavishing him with praise. A New York Times report from Wednesday said Moderna has refused to cooperate with the administration on producing doses at-cost for donation around the world. Biden noted that figure means that for every shot given in the U.S., the U.S. will have donated three doses elsewhere. The U.S. will also partner with the European Union in a vaccine partnership that will expand global vaccinations, especially through vaccine donations. The president also committed to helping scale manufacturing capacity for vaccines across the world. \"For example, our Quad-partnership with India, Japan and Australia is on track to help produce at least one billion vaccine doses in India to boost the global supply by the end of 2022. And we\\'re providing financing and helping to strengthen manufacturing in South Africa, and produce more than 500 million doses of J&J in Africa -- for Africa -- next year,\" Biden said. Biden failed to mention though that a major South African lab will only be bottling the vaccine, not making the vaccine itself, nor the fact that the Indian government blocked export of vaccine from India to South Africa months ago in order to focus on its own outbreak. These examples belie Biden\\'s claims that the administration is facilitating a ramp up on manufacturing around the world. \"Were not going to solve this crisis with half measures, or middle of the road, ambitions. We need to go big,\" Biden said. \"And we need to do our part, governments, the private sector, civil society, leaders, philanthropists. This is an all hands on deck crisis.\" The president has also directed Secretary of State Antony Blinken to monitor the progress of other countries by convening foreign ministers later this year. He also proposed continued global summits on COVID-19 to ensure progress. \"We can do this,\" Biden said. \"We can do this. We have to do this.\"\\nAfter months of negotiations, bipartisan police reform talks are officially over without a deal. Sources told ABC News Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott that Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., called Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., Wednesday morning to tell him that negotiations would be ending after Scott didn\\'t accept the final offer Democrats had made. Lead negotiators for Democrats, Booker and Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., made that final offer during a meeting Tuesday. Democrats said it was \"the bare minimum of what they could accept at this point,\" a source told ABC News. Booker told reporters at the Capitol later Wednesday that despite \"significant strides\" made in negotiations, the groups could not come to an agreement and indicated that he will revisit other paths to achieve police reforms. \"We haven\\'t settled on any strategy but I just want to make it clear that this is not an end, the efforts to create substantive policing reform will continue,\" Booker said. \"It is a disappointment that we are at this moment, but the fact that you have the largest police fraternity -- police union in the nation -- who has been willing to entertain significant and substantive reforms, the fact that you have people like the (International Association of Chiefs of Police) ... this is a big movement than where we were just a year or two ago.\" Scott told ABC News that he would not be a part of \"defunding the police,\" citing concerns about high rates of violent crimes happening in many major U.S. cities. \"Everybody knows that change requires resources,\" Scott said of the negotiations. \"So when, when you\\'re talking about making progress in the bill and your definition of progress is to make it punitive -- or take more money away from officers if they don\\'t do what you want them to do -- that\\'s defunding the police.\" \"I\\'m not going to be a part of defunding the police,\" he added. In a statement to ABC News, attorney Ben Crump said, \"On behalf of the families of George Floyd and so many others who have been impacted by police violence, we express our extreme disappointment in Senate leaders\\' inability to reach a reasonable solution for federal police reform. \"People -- including many police leaders -- have raised their voices for something to change, and partisan politics once again prevents common sense reform,\" the statement continued. Talks hit a major snag early in the summer over the involvement of police unions. There were still significant sticking points between the two sides over qualified immunity and how officers should be prosecuted. Booker said in a statement Wednesday that, \"even with this law enforcement support and further compromises we offered, there was still too wide a gulf with our negotiating partners and we faced significant obstacles to securing a bipartisan deal.\" \"The time has come to explore all other options to achieve meaningful and common sense policing reform,\" Booker added in his statement. \"I will not stop fighting until we achieve change that keeps our communities and police officers safe.\" In late June, sources told ABC News that the lead negotiators had \"reached an agreement framework,\" but there were still major points of contention that led to the breakdown in negotiations. The biggest obstacle was the disagreement from police unions. In June, Scott told Booker that if he could get unions \"on board with a proposal, he would not stand in the way,\" a source told ABC News. In the end, the National Association of Police Organization (NAPO) took issue with the proposed legislation and the fact that it was not included in talks and encouraged negotiators to reject the deal. The proposal would have provided more resources to police departments but would have also increased federal power in bringing misconduct cases in areas of excessive force, sexual misconduct, theft and obstruction of justice. The deal did not address qualified immunity, which was another hurdle for Republicans and a red line for many progressive Democrats. Despite the problems, both Democrats and Republicans voiced their commitment to continue talks in late June. However, issues of qualified immunity and how officers could be prosecuted and the involvement of police unions approved to be insurmountable policy differences to get the proposal to the floor. Since the talks fell through, advocates have expressed disappointment and outrage. Tiffany Crutcher, whose twin brother Terence was shot and killed by police in Oklahoma in 2016, has spent time lobbying for reform at the Capitol with the family of George Floyd. She released a statement Wednesday, specifically criticizing Scott and other GOP lawmakers. \"We all know Congress can do whatever it has the will to do. We will see this next week when lawmakers will reach a last-minute agreement to avoid a shutdown,\" Crutcher said. \"And yet after years of action, work and pleas from Black Americans, Republican Senators are unwilling to keep this promise to the American people.\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson criticized lawmakers in a press release Wednesday. \"They have chosen to stand with those who have lynched the very people they are meant to protect and serve,\" Johnson said. Johnson added, however, that \"the battle for police reform is far from over\" citing that there are \"innocent lives at stake.\" Others have indicated that they are still looking for other means to achieve meaningful reforms, Bass called on President Joe Biden and the White House to \"use the full extent of their constitutionally mandated power to bring about meaningful police reform,\" in a statement Wednesday. Biden heeded that call and released a statement Wednesday vowing to find other ways to improve policing, though he said that he still hoped to \"sign into law a comprehensive and meaningful police reform bill that honors the name and memory of George Floyd.\" \"The White House will continue to consult with the civil rights and law enforcement and civil rights communities, as well as victims\\' families to define a path forward, including through potential further executive actions I can take to advance our efforts to live up to the American ideal of equal justice under law,\" the president said in his statement. White House press secretary Jen Paski said during a press briefing Wednesday that the administration is disappointed that the negotiations fell apart. \"We also agree that it\\'s unfortunate and disappointing that Republicans rejected reforms that even the president had supported and refused to engage on key issues that many in law enforcement were willing to address,\" Psaki said. \"We agree that\\'s incredibly disappointing and these reforms are long overdue, and that certainly is the president\\'s point of view.\" ABC News\\' Mariam Khan, Trish Turner and Ben Gittleson contributed to this report.\\nNEW YORK -- Former President George W. Bush will headline a fundraiser next month for top Donald Trump critic Liz Cheney, turning her reelection race into a proxy war of sorts between the ex-presidents who represent two competing factions of the Republican Party. Bush will be the featured guest at an Oct. 18 event in Dallas supporting the Wyoming congresswoman\\'s campaign, according to a person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to discuss the fundraiser by name and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Cheney, a daughter of Bush\\'s two-term vice president, Dick Cheney, was the most prominent House Republican to vote to impeach Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. She has since emerged as one of his most vocal antagonists, and Trump has vowed to exact his revenge. Bush\\'s involvement puts the two former Republican presidents directly at odds and underscores the deep tension that remains within the party between Trumpism and the GOP\\'s establishment wing. Earlier this month, Trump announced his support for Cheney challenger Harriet Hageman, a Wyoming attorney looking to unseat the three-term congresswoman. Bush spokesperson Freddy Ford said in a statement that the former president \"has historically helped a few key candidates and friends each cycle, so this one shouldnt come as any surprise.\" \"President Bush is impressed by Liz Cheneys strength and vision, and hes proud to support her,\" he added. Trump on Wednesday evening fired back in a statement that cast Bush as a \"Republican in name only,\" despite his lengthy leadership of the party, and labeled Cheney \"warmongering\" and \"so bad for Wyoming.\" Cheneys campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday on the significance of the fundraiser. Bush aides did not comment on any possible plans to campaign on the congresswoman\\'s behalf. While Bush has generally kept a low profile since leaving office in 2009, he delivered a pointed speech earlier this month on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in which he warned of the country\\'s growing internal division and a \"violence that gathers within.\" \"There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home,\" he said as he delivered the keynote address at the national memorial to the victims of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. \"But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit. And it is our continuing duty to confront them.\" The warning came eight months after the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters attempting to overturn Democrat Joe Biden\\'s victory in the 2020 election. It marked some of Bushs sharpest criticism of that attack and appeared to be an implicit criticism of Trumps brand of politics. Trump, a longtime critic of Bush who ran on opposing the country\\'s wars in the Middle East, responded to the speech by slamming Bush for suggesting \"terrorists on the \\'right are a bigger problem than those from foreign countries that hate America, and that are pouring into our Country right now.\" \"He shouldnt be lecturing us about anything,\" Trump said in a statement. \"The World Trade Center came down during his watch. Bush led a failed and uninspiring presidency. He shouldnt be lecturing anybody!\" Cheney was ousted from her leadership position as the No. 3 House Republican for taking on Trump but has nonetheless posted huge fundraising numbers, with two consecutive record quarters, according to financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. That includes bringing in $1.88 million from April through June and $1.54 million in the first three months of 2021, reports show. Trump has endorsed several other Republicans challenging GOP incumbents who voted to impeach him. That includes Kelly Tshibaka, who is running against Sen. Lisa Murkowski in Alaska; Michigan state Rep. Steve Carra, who is trying to unseat longtime Rep. Fred Upton; and Joe Kent, who is challenging Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler in Washington. Republican Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio announced last week he will be retiring instead of running for reelection next year against a Trump-backed opponent.\\nMark Meadows and Brad Parscale are among those who could be subpoenaed. The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol could issue its first subpoenas in the coming days, possibly targeting several former high-level aides to President Donald Trump for records and information, sources tell ABC News. Former GOP congressman and Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and White House aides Dan Scavino and Stephen Miller are among those of interest to the committee, sources familiar with the matter have told ABC News. Trump\\'s former campaign manager Brad Parscale, who, like the other aides, remains close to the former president, could also be subpoenaed by the panel, sources said. Sources also said that John Eastman, a lawyer who worked with Trump\\'s legal team last year, could also be subpoenaed for records and testimony by the committee. Eastman was the author of a controversial memo obtained by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa that encouraged Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election results on Jan. 6 to keep Trump in office by rejecting the electors in nearly a dozen states. News of the possible subpoenas was first reported by the Guardian. A spokesperson for the House committee declined to comment when reached by ABC News. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., told reporters on Monday that the first subpoenas could be issued \"within a week.\" Lawmakers were briefed on the status of the probe by committee staff for more than five hours Monday night in the Capitol, meeting in person for the first time in weeks to walk through the complex inquiry via PowerPoint slides. Thompson said the committee has scheduled testimony with persons of interest, but would not say who those people are and whether they have officially accepted the invitations from the committee. Committee investigators are in the process of reviewing thousands of pages of documents obtained in response to requests issued in recent weeks to federal government agencies and 35 social media and communications companies. The panel has also requested documents from the National Archives, which maintains and preserves White House records. National Archives officials said they\\'re in the process of reviewing the request and have yet to turn over any documents to the committee for their review.\\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A federal judge has struck down portions of a Florida immigration enforcement law that was a priority of the state\\'s Republican governor, saying in her ruling that the measure was racially motivated. U.S. Judge Beth Bloom on Tuesday rejected sections of the law that ban local government sanctuary policies and require local law enforcement to make their best effort to work with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The office of Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed the bill into law with much fanfare in 2019 as a priority of his administration, said Wednesday that it would appeal. Bloom repeatedly said that the law was racially motivated and that its supporters showed no evidence as to why it was needed to lower crime. She said that the sponsor of the bill -- SB 168 -- was guided by anti-immigrant hate groups such as Floridians for Immigration Enforcement. \"Allowing anti-immigrant hate groups that overtly promote xenophobic, nationalist, racist ideologies to be intimately involved in a bills legislative process is a significant departure from procedural norms,\" Bloom wrote. \"This involvement strongly suggests that the Legislature enacted SB 168 to promote and ratify the racist views of these advocacy groups.\" Bloom cited numerous communication between Floridians for Immigration Enforcement and state Sen. Joe Gruters\\' staff. Gruters sponsored the bill and also serves as chairman of the state Republican Party. \"On many occasions during the 2019 legislative session, (Floridians for Immigration Enforcement\\'s ) racial animus and discriminatory intent were made apparent to Senator Gruters and his staff but were ignored,\" Bloom wrote. Gruters didnt immediately respond to a message left on his cellphone. In 2019, DeSantis signed the bill at a campaign-style appearance in the conservative Panhandle region, unlike his other more subdued formal bill signing events. An overflow crowd dotted with red \"Make America Great Again\" hats cheered wildly in support of the bill. They also cheered equally loud at mentions of then-President Donald Trump. The governor\\'s office defended the law Wednesday. \"Yet again a federal trial court judge partially enjoins a plainly constitutional state statute,\" said DeSantis spokeswoman Taryn Fenske. \"We disagree with the judges ruling and expect to win on appeal.\" Democrats and immigrant advocates praised the ruling. \"Floridians deserve a legislature that prioritizes people over politics, not one that repeatedly squanders taxpayer money defending extreme legislation designed to bolster the Governors political ambitions. Florida has and will always be an immigrant state,\" said Democratic state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith in a statement. Many of the bills DeSantis has signed in the law have been challenged in court, where he\\'s often lost in lower courts. The state has appealed those rulings, including an \"anti-riot\" law inspired by Black Lives Matter protests around the country, a ban on vaccine passports and punishments for large social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook who block people based on political posts. He\\'s also being challenged on state orders to ban mask mandates in schools. Among other laws being challenged in court: New election rules that make it more difficult to vote by mail, a ban on the participation of transgender women and girls in school sports and limits on contributions to groups seeking to change the state constitution.\\nSix Native American tribes are suing Wisconsin to try to stop its planned wolf hunt in November Six Native American tribes sued Wisconsin on Tuesday to try to stop its planned gray wolf hunt in November, asserting that the hunt violates their treaty rights and endangers an animal they consider sacred. The Chippewa tribes say treaties give them rights to half of the wolf quota in territory they ceded to the United States in the mid-1800s. But rather than hunt wolves, the tribes want to protect them. The tribal lawsuit comes three weeks after a coalition of wildlife advocacy groups sued to stop Wisconsins wolf hunt this fall and void a state law mandating annual hunts, arguing that the statutes dont give wildlife managers any leeway to consider population estimates. Hunters blew past their limit during a court-ordered hunt in February. The state Department of Natural Resources set the quota at 119, but hunters killed 218 wolves in just four days, forcing an early end to the season. Conservationists then deluged the department with requests to cancel this fall\\'s hunt out of concerns it could devastate the wolf population. Agency biologists recommended setting the fall quota at 130. But the agencys board last month set the kill limit at 300. The tribes have claimed their half, but since they won\\'t hunt wolves, the working quota for state-licensed hunters would be 150. The lawsuit alleges the board\\'s decision to set the quota at 300 was a deliberate move to nullify the tribes\\' share and was not based on science. The DNRs latest estimates put Wisconsin\\'s wolf population at roughly 1,000. Opponents say hunters probably killed at least a quarter of the population if poaching is included. \"In our treaty rights, were supposed to share with the state 50-50 in our resources and were feeling that were not getting our due diligence because of the slaughter of wolves in February,\" John Johnson Sr., president of the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. The Ojibwe word for \"wolf\" is Maiingan, and the Indigenous people of the Great Lakes region often call themselves Anishinaabe. The wolf holds a sacred place in their creation story. \"To the Anishinaabe, the Maiingan are our brothers. The legends and stories tell us as brothers we walk hand in hand together. What happens to the Maiingan happens to humanity,\" Marvin Defoe, an official and elder with Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, said in the statement. Hunters, farmers and conservationists have been fighting over how to manage Wisconsin\\'s wolves. Farmers say wolves kill livestock, while hunters are looking for another species to stalk. The six tribes are represented by Earthjustice, which is one of several groups that are suing the federal government over the Trump administrations decision last November to lift Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves across most of the U.S. and return management authority to the states. Gray wolves in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan are considered part of the western Great Lakes population, which is managed separately from wolves in western states. The Biden administration last Wednesday said federal protections may need to be restored for western wolves because Republican-backed state laws have made it much easier to kill the predators. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\\'s initial determination that western wolves could again be imperiled launched a yearlong biological review. Dozens of tribes asked the Biden administration one day earlier to immediately enact emergency protections for gray wolves across the country, saying states have become too aggressive in hunting them. They asked Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to act quickly on an emergency petition they filed in May to relist the wolf as endangered or threatened.\\nAs President Joe Biden\\'s \"summer of freedom\" transformed into a summer of record-high pediatric hospitalizations and an alarming surge of a new, highly contagious COVID-19 variant, public health experts increasingly agree that mandating vaccines may be the fastest way to return to normal. Despite much handwringing, data shows that vaccine mandates are not only effective, but also popular among employees and employers. That said, companies are awaiting the details of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules and further guidance on boosters. It is clear that employers are facing a bumpy road in the near term. Despite the FDA granting full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, the number of new people receiving their first dose now hangs at an average of 342,000 people per day. To help spur vaccination rates and the economy, Biden tapped into a key delivery channel: the workplace. Estimated to impact around 100 million American workers, the plan requires vaccinations for all federal workers and contractors and requires all employers with 100 or more employees to mandate vaccinations or have employees face weekly testing. Employers are waiting to hear the details from the Department of Labor and OSHA, which is drafting an emergency temporary standard to carry out the mandate. In the spring, state leaders and employers hoped they could lure populations with incentives. We know that none of the vaccination incentive programs--from the guaranteed rewards to the lotteries --led to a significant increase in COVID-19 vaccination rates. Vaccine mandates are the most effective way to keep workplaces safe and send a clear message to the unvaccinated. Vaccination mandates in the workplace are both popular and effective. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 51% of those surveyed were in favor of employers requiring vaccines, and a CNN poll found that 54% support vaccinations for office workers. One leader in employer vaccination mandates, United Airlines, reported that most of its remaining unvaccinated staffers have now been vaccinated since a mandate was introduced. We believe instances like these will become the norm over the coming weeks. Mandates are essential to creating safe workplaces, many of which have seen high levels of COVID-19 transmission. We know for example, Tyson Foods has experienced many COVID-19 outbreaks at its plants and now will require all employees to be vaccinated. While it was initially believed that employees would resign en masse in the face of vaccination mandates, many pieces of anecdotal evidence suggests that this is not the case. Rather it is likely that the more common event is employees resigning due to a failure of their employers to protect them. At the University of Oklahoma, some OU faculty and staff have decided to send their families out of the state or leave their jobs altogether as state policies prohibited vaccination or mask mandates. \"I have love for my department and colleagues, but I\\'ve no choice. I cannot put my children at risk because an entitled 20-year-old won\\'t get a vaccine or wear a mask,\" one staff member told the universitys student newspaper. Similar events have happened at state universities in Georgia, as one faculty member resigned on the spot as an unmasked student who refused to put on a mask. It is abundantly clear that vaccination mandates, part of a larger strategy to keep employees safe, have support from employees themselves. Paid time off is key. In spring 2021, McDonalds, Target and Trader Joes, among other companies, offered paid time off for employees to get vaccinated. The White House incorporated this policy for all employers with 100 or more employees to provide paid time off for workers to get vaccinated and for post-vaccination recovery from side effects. This is a monumental step to help increase vaccine access and will help assuage concerns over missing work due to side effects. Employer vaccine mandates are also good for the economy. The delta variant is partially to blame for Augusts slowing job growth and it threatens our countrys economic recovery. Markets soared to new highs following full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Solving the public health problem will help increase consumer confidence, as already seen in some vaccinated counties. Our national vaccination strategy needed a boost and employers continue to serve as the backbone. While we wait for OHSA policies and 3rd dose guidance, employers are mitigating the daily risks related to the variant. These acts of proactive leadership are essential to reduce risks for all.

However, the reprieve comes at a high cost -- with the state now experiencing a near record-breaking surge in virus-related deaths. \"We are seeing a decrease in the number of patients that are in the hospital, but unfortunately, it\\'s not because all of them are getting better and going home to their families... These patients are dying,\" Dr. Kierstin Kennedy, chief of hospital medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, told ABC News. Statewide, there are now more than 2,100 patients hospitalized with coronavirus, and intensive care unit capacity also remains tight, with 97% of ICU beds currently in use, according to federal data. Although numbers are now coming down, said Kennedy, this surge is different from the last one, because \"patients are so sick,\" and are thus requiring longer stays. \"A lot of our patients that are in the acute-care settings are getting worse and requiring the ICU. I think overall, the need for ICU beds remains high across the state,\" Kennedy added. Because more than 74% of the Alabama\\'s elderly population chose to be vaccinated, they have fared better throughout this latest surge, Kennedy said. However, this latest wave has also been a particularly disconcerting experience, she added, because the patient population is much younger, and primarily consisting of unvaccinated people. \"These patients are as sick if not sicker than elderly patients, they\\'re staying in the hospital longer and they\\'re dying at an alarming rate,\" Kennedy said. \"It\\'s unlike anything that I\\'ve seen.\" The new surge comes as recent data revealed that for the first time in Alabama\\'s history, there were more deaths than births in 2020. \"Here in Alabama, we continue to see deaths at a really high rate. ... 2020 is going to be the first year that we know of in the history of our state where we actually had more deaths than births -- our state literally shrunk in 2020,\" Alabama State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris reported during a press conference on Friday. In 2020, data showed that 64,714 Alabama residents died and only 57,641 were born. Even in World War II or the 1918 flu pandemic, there was never a time that deaths exceeded births, Harris added. \"It\\'s certainly possible that could happen this year as well if we continue at the same rate that we\\'re seeing now,\" Harris noted. Even as the situation shows signs of improvement, the country is entering flu season, and public health measures have been considerably relaxed in Alabama. \"At this point, we\\'re just kind of bracing ourselves, as we see the resumption of college football and people out in large numbers, and wondering how that is going to fare, as far as inpatient volumes both for COVID and for flu,\" Kennedy said. Additionally, Alabama has one of the country\\'s lowest vaccination rates, with just 41.6% of the state\\'s total population fully vaccinated, putting much of the state\\'s population still at-risk for severe infection. \"Unless we see a dramatic uptick in the number of people that get vaccinated, our concern is that we will do this again in just a few months. And every time we do it, it seems to get worse,\" Kennedy said. The ongoing crisis has left front-line workers frustrated, Kennedy said, admitting that she still does not see an end in sight. \"Watching people out in the community behave as though COVID is not an issue or that it\\'s over, is really -- it\\'s a really sharp contrast to what we\\'re seeing in the hospital and sometimes that\\'s very difficult to process,\" Kennedy said. \"We don\\'t have to be in these situations. We are choosing illness and death in a way that is just very unnatural.\"\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer booster shots Wednesday for seniors and other high-risk Americans, paving the way for third doses to be offered as early as the end of the week. The decision would allow for anyone 65 or older to get a booster, as well as people as young as 18 if they have a medical condition that puts them at risk of severe COVID-19 or if they work a frontline job that makes it more likely that they would get infected. FDA\\'s acting commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock, said that list should include health care workers, teachers and grocery story workers, as well as people in prisons and homeless shelters. \"This pandemic is dynamic and evolving, with new data about vaccine safety and effectiveness becoming available every day,\" Woodcock said in a statement. \"As we learn more about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including the use of a booster dose, we will continue to evaluate the rapidly changing science and keep the public informed.\" The deliberation follows a recommendation last week by the FDA\\'s independent scientific advisers that, while protection from vaccination is strong, immunity probably wanes after six months and is important to replenish for certain high-risk groups. The advisory panel, called the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said last Friday there wasn\\'t enough evidence yet to recommend every vaccinated adult get a third dose. Instead, the panel recommended the extra shot for those 65 and older or at high risk of severe COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will determine exactly which populations are eligible. The FDA\\'s vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, framed the booster debate as one \"based on complex data sets evolving in front of our eyes,\" but with key information still incoming on how boosters will impact a wider age group, the panel ultimately indicated current data has yet to mature enough to recommend boosters for all. \"We need safety data for younger populations and we need to really know what the benefit is,\" Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, told ABC News Friday. \"So far we\\'ve got some reasonable data for older people, but I really think that there are too many questions on the younger populations.\" Currently, only immunocompromised Americans are eligible for a third dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. An estimated 2 million people have received a third mRNA based vaccine from the two manufacturers. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have also asked the government to agree to booster shots for a larger population, and those requests are pending FDA review. FDA decisions are expected within the coming weeks. If and when the career scientists at the FDA decide to sign off on boosters, the Pfizer vaccine can be labeled and administered as a three-dose vaccine for certain groups. But before delivering the shots, the CDC will need to issue official recommendations. A separate independent panel that advises the CDC is set to meet Wednesday for presentations and then again on Thursday to discuss the data in more granular detail before a vote. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky is then expected to weigh in by the end of the week with an official recommendation for who exactly should get the shots. Among the recommendations by the CDC will be a decision on who qualifies as \"high risk\" and which \"front-line\" workers are at highest risk of exposure. Experts say it\\'s possible the FDA will endorse the idea of booster shots for people under 65 without conditions that put them at higher risk of severe illness as new data comes in. \"The story is not over because more and more data is coming in,\" White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci told ABC\\'s Martha Raddatz on \"This Week\" Sunday. \"I think we really do need to test the water with one foot as we move forward,\" Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA advisory panel member and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC News following the panel\\'s vote last week. \"By the end of this week I think we\\'ll learn more about exactly what the recommendations are,\" he said. ABC News\\' Eric M. Strauss, Anne Flaherty, Sony Salzman and Cheyenne Haslett contributed to this report.\\nGerman police say they have solved a burglary case at a kindergarten after a storytelling gadget the suspect had swiped revealed his location BERLIN -- German police say they have solved a burglary case at a kindergarten after a storytelling gadget the suspect had swiped revealed his location. Police said Tuesday that the 44-year-old suspect had stolen various items during a break-in at a kindergarten in the western town of Halver in April. Among them were a laptop, picture books, cups and glasses, some fish sticks, pasta and a smart speaker for playing children\\'s stories. When the man tried to download new stories onto the device a month later it sent his home location to the manufacturers, who informed police. Police said the device has since been returned in working condition to the kindergarten, where it was eagerly received by the children. There was no fairytale ending for the suspect, however. \"He faces criminal charges,\" district police spokesman Christof Huels told The Associated Press.\\nThe shots, given two months apart, can offer 94% protection against infections. A second dose of Johnson & Johnson\\'s COVID-19 vaccine given two months after the first leads to stronger protection, according to the company. The new data, announced in a press release, adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that booster shots could enhance vaccine protection against breakthrough infections -- though experts agree all three vaccines are still doing their job to protect against more serious illness. Compared to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Johnson & Johnson\\'s single-shot vaccine always had slightly lower efficacy. Peak efficacy from the two-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines was 95% and 94%, respectively, against symptomatic illness. But two Johnson & Johnson shots, given two months apart, resulted in a similarly high effectiveness level: 94% protection against any symptomatic infection in the U.S., and 100% against severe disease. With Pfizer\\'s booster shots now up for formal review from the Food and Drug Administration, and Moderna\\'s shortly to follow, the new data will likely factor into regulators\\' decision about if and when additional shots are appropriate for the nearly 14.9 million people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. All three currently authorized vaccines are still working well to dramatically reduce the risk of being hospitalized, but as months pass and with the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, the vaccines are losing their power to prevent more mild breakthrough infections. The new Johnson & Johnson data also raises questions about when to give an additional shot for the country\\'s only single shot vaccine. New data describing a booster two-months later found a marked increase in antibody levels. But prior data, already published, found that a booster shot given six months after the first dose results in even higher antibody levels. \"With the two-month boost interval, there was a four-fold increase in antibody titters. But when a booster was given after six months, it led to a 12-fold increase in antibody titers,\" Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, whose lab helped develop the J&J vaccine, told ABC News. \"This suggests that the efficacy might be even greater when the booster is given at this later point in time,\" Barouch said. Regulatory authorities will need to weigh the available evidence and determine the appropriate timing for booster shots for all three vaccines. In prepared remarks, J&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels said the single-shot vaccine still provides \"strong and long-lasting protection\" while also being \"easy to use, distribute and administer.\"\"At the same time,\" Stoffels said, \"we now have generated evidence that a booster shot further increases protection against COVID-19 and is expected to extend the duration of protection significantly.\" According to Barouch, \"the data supports the single-shot vaccine as the bedrock for providing robust and durable protection. But giving a boost two to six months later increases immune responses and augments protection to very high levels.\"\\nA 49-year-old man was taken into custody on suspicion of murder, police said. A 20-year-old gas station cashier was fatally shot in Germany Saturday after telling a customer to put on a face covering, according to the Trier Police Department. A 49-year-old man was taken into custody on suspicion of murder after the shooting in the town of Idar-Oberstein, in Rhineland-Palatinate. The customer entered the gas station around 7:45 p.m. local time and got into an argument with the cashier, who asked him to mask up, police said in a press release. Germany currently has a requirement to wear masks in stores. The suspect left the gas station but returned at 9:25 p.m., this time with a face covering on. But this time when he got to the checkout, police said he pulled down the mask, and after a short exchange of words, pulled out a gun and fatally shot the cashier, who police described as a student. The suspect then fled on foot after opening fire, police said. Using surveillance footage, police launched a manhunt for the suspect. He appeared at the Idar-Oberstein police station Sunday around 8:40 a.m., accompanied by a woman, where he was arrested, officials said. Investigators found the alleged murder weapon as well as other firearms and ammunition during a search of the suspect\\'s apartment, according to police. They said it\\'s not clear where he got the weapons. Police and public prosecutors said in a press release that the suspect \"acted out of anger about the rejection\" during his first visit to the gas station and the cashier\\'s request to mask up. \"He stated in his interrogation that he rejected the coronavirus protective measures,\" police said. Authorities haven\\'t named the suspect or the victim. Idar-Oberstein Mayor Frank Fruhauf slammed the attack as a \"quite inconceivable, terrible act,\" adding, \"Such a crime is unprecedented. It will take time to come to terms with it,\" German outlet DW News reported. Annalena Baerbock, the center-left Green Party\\'s candidate for chancellor in the country\\'s federal election slated for Sunday, tweeted, \"Im shaken by this terrible murder of a young man who merely asked that existing rules be followed.\" The incident has raised debate in the country over the radicalization of Querdenker, Germany\\'s anti-COVID-19 lockdown protest movement, where followers have become increasingly vocal online and off about their refusal to comply with public health mandates and their relationship to conspiracy theories. \"I am greatly concerned about the radicalization of the Querdenker. We are all challenged to stand against the growing hatred,\" Baerbock added. Germany\\'s COVID restrictions have triggered repeated protests from anti-mask demonstrators throughout the pandemic. Just last month 600 protesters were detained by police after thousands protested the COVID-19 measures and a ban on gatherings in early August in Berlin, the Associated Press reported. There have been 4.1 million cases of COVID-19 and over 93,000 deaths related to the virus in the country, according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center data.\\nA New York City inmate who died of a medical emergency in a floating jail has become at least the 12th death of a city inmate this year and the second this week NEW YORK -- An inmate on a New York City jail barge died Wednesday after a medical emergency, the citys Department of Correction said. It is at least the 12th death of a city inmate this year and the second this week amid what some elected officials and advocates have deemed a \"humanitarian crisis\" in the city\\'s lockups. The Department of Correction said in a statement that the inmate at the Vernon C. Bain Center, a floating Bronx jail across the East River from the Rikers Island jail complex, appeared to be in medical distress and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead around 10:50 a.m. Correction Commissioner Vincent Schiraldi said he was \"devastated to see that we have yet another death in custody, and determined to stop this heartbreaking trend.\" \"We are doing all we can to remedy the unprecedented crisis we are experiencing in our jails. My thoughts and prayers are with the individuals loved ones,\" Schiraldi said. The Department of Correction identified the inmate as Stephen Khadu, who had been held on a second-degree murder charge since December 2019. The cause of death is under investigation by the city medical examiners office. City officials had conflicting information on Khadu\\'s age, but placed him at being in either his 20s or 30s. The Bain Center, a five-story jail stacked on a 625-foot (190-meter) barge, opened in 1992 as temporary relief for crowded citys jails. Since then, its been criticized for overcrowding. The citys jail system, troubled by years of neglect, has spiraled into turmoil during the coronavirus pandemic with a spike in inmate deaths, violence, self-harm and staff absences. More city jail inmates have died this year than in any of the past three years. There were seven deaths in 2020, three in 2019 and eight in 2018, according to the Department of Correction. Most of the trouble has been concentrated on Rikers Island. On Sunday, Rikers inmate Isaabdul Karim, 42, died at a jail infirmary after reporting he was not feeling well, officials said. He was given CPR but later pronounced dead. At least five Rikers inmates have died this year by suicide, the most since 2005. The chaos has led to growing calls to overhaul or immediately close Rikers Island, which the city has said will be shuttered by 2027. On Tuesday, Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jerry Nadler, Jamaal Bowman and Nydia Velazquez sent a letter to Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Bill de Blasio, demanding the release of inmates and closure of the complex. They called conditions at the jail \"deplorable and nothing short of a humanitarian crisis.\" Last week, de Blasio announced reform plans including requiring a doctors note if a jail guard is out more than a day and suspending guards 30 days without pay if they dont show up to work. Hochul signed a bill largely eliminating jail for technical parole violations. Also Wednesday, the city withdrew a lawsuit filed Monday that accused the union for jail guards of condoning or encouraging employee absences in what the city said was an illegal strike. The lawsuit was dropped after the union\\'s lawyer agreed to make a statement in court declaring that officers who are fit for duty should show up to work and that the union has never instructed anyone to not show up for work or call out sick when they\\'re not ill. Benny Boscio Jr., the union\\'s president, called the lawsuit \"frivolous\" and demanded the mayor visit Rikers Island. The city\\'s lawyers credited the lawsuit with forcing the union to encourage officers to show up to work. Meanwhile, the union continues to balk at de Blasios plan to send private security guards to Rikers so that 150 correctional officers who currently guard the complex\\'s perimeter could be moved inside the jails. The union says such a move would violate a union-backed state law that prohibits the city from replacing public jail employees with private guards. De Blasio said it would be only a temporary, emergency fix. \"This is an emergency dynamic,\" de Blasio told reporters Wednesday. \"Until this moment has passed, were going to use whatever tool it takes to keep people safe.\" ------ Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak and Michelle L.

The complaint includes images it says shows John Douglas Allen, allegedly angry about \"immoral communications,\" in the act of placing explosives outside an AT&T and a Verizon store in northern Michigan last week. The pipe bombs were placed in boxes that also contained handcuffs and had the moniker \"Handcuff Johnny\" written on them, prosecutors say. Allen, who allegedly defines \"immoral communications\" as foul language, pornography and \"all manner of indecent communication,\" claimed to be part of the \"Coalition for Moral Telecommunication,\" which prosecutors allege he later admitted was a fictional organization. The suspect also allegedly taped notes addressed to AT&T, Verizon and \"all other carriers\" to three telecommunications towers in northern Michigan that he believed were related to the stores. In the missives, he threatened to go around the country \"and begin distroying [sic] inner city tower communication\" unless several demands were met, prosecutors said. The notes \"contained language indicating that this was the \\'last warning\\' and that next time, it would be during \\'business hours,\\'\" court documents say. After placing the pipe bombs, Allen swapped his Michigan license plate for a California one to avoid detection, prosecutors allege. Federal agents were able to identify Allen shortly after seeing his vehicle on a toll camera system. During the interview with federal agents, Allen allegedly admitted to the attempted bombings. \"Allen bought the components of the bombs about one year ago at various hardware stores. He used cash to buy these components to avoid detection by law enforcement. For the past year, the bombs were in a box at his property. He waited a year to build up the courage to place them,\" court documents say. Allen allegedly told agents that he acted alone and the \"Handcuff Johnny\" reference would mean hed likely end up in handcuffs as a result of his actions. He was charged with extortion and attempted damage or destruction of buildings but has not yet entered a plea. A lawyer for Allen did not respond to an ABC News request for comment.\\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said Tuesday in an exclusive interview it was \"concerning\" if North Korea has resumed its nuclear activities \"in earnest\" and stressed the importance of reactivating talks between North Korea and the United States, as well as inter-Korea talks. \"I believe that we need to have North Korea understand that dialogue and diplomacy are the only way to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula,\" Moon told ABC News anchor Juju Chang. Moon is attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York City this week to talk about climate change. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported last month that North Korea appears to have restarted the operation of its main nuclear reactor used to produce weapons fuels, as North Korea openly threatens to enlarge its nuclear arsenal amid dormant nuclear diplomacy with the United States. When asked about North Korea\\'s nuclear program, which is going \"full steam ahead\" according to U.N. atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi, Moon said while North Korea has been \"intensifying tension, launching missiles and conducting other activities, it is of great relief that it has kept good on its moratorium on nuclear tests and ICBM launches.\" Moon was also asked about North Korea\\'s criticism of the United States\\' decision to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. North Korean state media quoted an unidentified North Korean Foreign Ministry official who called the arrangement, made between the U.S., Britain and Australia, an \"extremely\" dangerous move, one that could set off a nuclear arms race. Moon conceded it is a \"great pity that the Korean Peninsula still is living in the era of the Cold War,\" adding that while \"remarkable changes\" have taken place during his time in office, they have \"yet to consolidate peace on the Korean Peninsula.\" Moon said he believes there is a \"possibility of resuming talks\" and thus finding \"a way, a pathway to the solution.\" Tensions have been high between North and South Korea. Both countries have recently tested ballistic missiles. This came as a stark contrast to their 2018 agreement when the two rival nations vowed to denuclearize the peninsula and end the long war between them. ABC News also sat down with K-pop sensation BTS exclusively to talk about the band\\'s new official role as South Korea\\'s presidential envoys for public diplomacy. As part of their new role, BTS attended the U.N. Global Assembly and performed at the United Nations. Their new video for \"Permission to Dance,\" which was filmed inside and around the U.N., has already racked up millions of views online. BTS said it is bringing a message of hope and community, talking about the importance of COVID-19 vaccines and sustainability. The exclusive interviews with Moon and BTS will air on Sept. 24, starting with \"Good Morning America.\"\\nThe Biden administration is trying to choke the finances of criminal ransomware gangs by sanctioning a Russia-based virtual currency brokerage it says has been used by at least eight ransomware gangs to launder criminal proceeds WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration sought Tuesday to choke the finances of criminal ransomware gangs, announcing sanctions against a Russia-based virtual currency brokerage that officials say helped at least eight ransomware gangs launder virtual currency. The Treasury Department sanctions are aimed at kneecapping the economic infrastructure of a ransomware threat that has surged over the last year, crippling corporations, schools, hospitals and critical infrastructure, including a major fuel pipeline. Ransomware payments reached more than $400 million in 2020, the costliest year on record. The goal is to go after the \"financial enablers\" of ransomware gangs, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told reporters. \"Todays action is a signal of our intention to expose and disrupt the illicit infrastructure using these attacks.\" The blacklisted brokerage is SUEX OTC, a so-called \"nested exchange\" that conducted transactions from accounts on major, legal global cryptocurrency exchanges. Such operations process a disproportionate amount of illicit transactions, Adeyemo said. In the case of SUEX, officials said, more than 40% of its known transactions have been associated with illicit actors. That\\'s more than $370 million, according to the cryptocurrency-tracking firm Elliptic. Through its Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Treasury Department has previously sanctioned ransomware developers and distributors -- though periodic retirements and rebrandings of ransomware strains have complicated those efforts. Officials say more such designations are possible. SUEX is among the biggest and most active of a small group of illicit services that handle most money laundering for cybercriminals including scammers and darknet market operators, another crypto transaction-tracking firm, Chainalysis, said in a blog post. Such firms work closely with law enforcement to track criminal money laundering online. Although legally registered in the Czech Republic, SUEX has no known physical presence there and operates out of branches in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia, where users can cash out their virtual currency, said Chainalysis, adding that it also has operations in the Middle East. Chainalysis said SUEX claims it can convert cryptocurrency holdings into cash and even real estate, cars and yachts. Most ransomware gangs operate out of reach of Western law enforcement in Russia and allied states. President Joe Biden has repeatedly told Vladimir Putin that he expects the Russian president to crack down on the gangs, but administration officials say they have seen no signs that Moscow is cooperating. Chainalysis said SUEX was laundering money from the illicit cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e, which U.S. authorities shut down, perhaps on behalf of administrators, associates or former users. BTC-e\\'s operator, arrested on holiday in Greece, was sentenced to five years in prison by a French court in December. \"SUEX largely communicated with its clients on the Telegram app and accepted new customers on a system of referrals from trusted intermediaries. This was not the kind of business where a random person on the internet could open an account,\" another crypto-tracking firm, TRM Labs, said in a blog post. \"Transactions were only completed in-person at SUEXs offices.\" TRM Labs CEO Esteban Castano said SUEX is what is known as a \"parasite exchange.\" They are difficult to detect by the legitimate exchanges whose infrastructure they exploit because they open accounts using fraudulent or stolen credentials to meet know-thy-customer requirements and then fly under the radar. Chainalysis said SUEX deposit addresses hosted at large exchanges have received over $160 million in Bitcoin alone from cybercriminals since the brokerage opened in early 2018, including nearly $13 million from ransomware operators including Ryuk, Conti and Maze. Ethereum and Tether are among other cryptoassets SUEX handled. The Treasury Department said it is also updating guidance for ransomware victims that it first issued last year. The advisory strongly discourages victims from paying ransomware, reminding them that some transactions are against the law, and urges victims to report attacks to law enforcement. \"The reality is that the thing we know about this ecosystem is the way that we prevent ransomware attacks is by making sure that we get law enforcement engaged as soon as possible,\" Adeyemo said. --- Bajak reported from Boston. -------- Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP\\nKaren Notzon\\'s daughter, Callie, began her first year of middle school this fall by opting out of in-person learning after initially deciding to return to the classroom. The Huntington Beach, California, mother told ABC News there were many reasons why her daughter changed her decision -- including the rising number of COVID-19 cases across the U.S. linked to the delta variant -- but one of the biggest ones was that a particular circumstance left Callie ineligible for vaccination in time for classes. The pre-teen turns 12 in November, and is not eligible for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine like some of her other classmates who had birthdays before her this year, Notzon said. Many students like Callie, who are entering sixth or seventh grade this year, are anxiously waiting to get their shots. While medical experts say there is little that can be done for those soon-to-be 12-year-olds until the vaccines are approved for younger people, they say there are some tips that schools and families can take to ensure that each child is safe this year. Annette Anderson, the deputy director for the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools, told ABC News that middle and high schools are dealing with a tough time going back to classes as there are scores of students who haven\\'t received their COVID-19 vaccines. As of Sept. 13, 52% of Americans between 12 and 15 have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Anderson, a former public school administrator and parent of a teenager, said the situation is very frustrating for those waiting for their child to age into the eligibility threshold, and could be harmful to students\\' emotional and mental wellbeing. \"This is a tough time for schools. We\\'ve never been in a situation like this,\" she said. \"You are building the plane as you\\'re flying it.\" Notzon said she is more comfortable keeping Callie at home until she is fully vaccinated for that very reason and because they have an elderly member of the family living in the house. \"We\\'ve had high anxiety putting our daughter in a position like that. It seems like a risk,\" she said. Dr. Jessica Justman, an associate professor of medicine in at the Columbia University\\'s Mailman School of Public Health, told ABC News that parents with children on the cusp of vaccine eligibility that choose in-person classes will have a better chance of staying safe if the school sticks to strict measures, especially with masking. Until more students receive their shots, indoor masking is the only line of defense from catching the virus, she said. \"It won\\'t be perfect, but whatever amount of time they spend wearing a mask is more time protected,\" Justman said. Katie Berkaw of Austin, Texas, told ABC News that her family is taking those same precautions seriously for her son, Connor, who turns 12 in October. Although the hospitalizations and COVID-19 cases in Texas have been skyrocketing over the last few weeks, Berkaw said her family ultimately decided that it was best for her to attend classes in person during that wait. \"Being back on campus is important for his social engagement,\" she said. In the meantime, Connor has been wearing a mask, as is required by his school district, washing his hands and avoiding big indoor events until he gets his shot, according to Berkaw. \"There is always a little bit of nervousness that he could get it,\" she said. \"But he understands the level of cleanliness that is needed for himself.\" Sharon Gucker, a single mom from Nassau County, New York, told ABC News that her 11-year-old son, Owen, has also been cautious at school, wearing a mask and avoiding big crowds, but he is near the end of the tunnel. The seventh grader, who is the youngest of Gucker\\'s three sons, turns 12 this Saturday and has already scheduled an appointment to get his vaccine at a New York state vaccination center, she said. This has been a moment the entire family has been waiting for, as they\\'ve been putting off many big activities due to the wait, including visiting family members on the West Coast. \"We\\'re still going to still wear our masks, but I think after that we will feel like a great weight off our shoulders,\" Gucker said. Justman and the other experts said practicing patience is the best things parents with kids who turn 12 later in the school year can do. While it is certainly a question of when the vaccines will be made eligible for people under 12 and not if, Justman said parents can have some relief knowing that their seventh or sixth grader is in a classroom with some classmates who have some protection against the virus. \"You can look at this from a glass half full perspective,\" she said. \"It\\'s more fortunate for these 11-year-olds to be in a classroom with so many people who are vaccinated.\" Anyone who needs help scheduling a free vaccine appointment can log onto vaccines.gov.\\nHe told the General Assembly the world was at \"an inflection point in history.\" President Joe Biden on Tuesday delivered his first speech as president to the United Nations General Assembly, telling diplomats that they were meeting at a moment \"intermingled with great pain and extraordinary possibility.\" He pitched his vision for America\\'s return to the world stage -- in sharp contrast with years of bellicosity from his predecessor, President Donald Trump -- in which Biden said the U.S. would helm the response to the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis, and put behind decades of conflict in favor of diplomacy and partnership. The world, he said, stood \"at an inflection point in history,\" saying that, \"to fight this pandemic, we need a collective act of science and political will.\" \"Today, many of our greatest concerns cannot be solved or even addressed through the force of arms,\" Biden said. \"Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19, or its future variants.\" His remarks were a laundry list of his goals -- with some of the strongest words reserved for the climate crisis -- that largely glossed over recent tensions with allies regarding the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan. \"We\\'ve ended 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan,\" Biden said, \"and as we close this period of relentless war, we\\'re opening a new era of relentless diplomacy of using the power of our development aid to invest in new ways of lifting people up around the world.\" He did not make even a passing reference to a recently announced defense partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom aimed at curbing China\\'s influence on in the Indo-Pacific region, which led Australia to nix a major defense deal with France for nuclear-powered submarine technology. That, in turn, prompted France to recall its ambassador from the U.S. and express its displeasure with Biden. As he left the United Nations complex, a reporter asked Biden how he planned to repair U.S.-France relations. Walking by, he replied simply, \"They\\'re great.\" The president then met with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, telling the Australian leader \"the United States has no closer and more reliable ally than Australia.\" The U.S. has helped revamp the so-called \"Quad\" dialogue -- its partnership with Australia, India and Japan -- to counter a rising China -- and Biden said that chief among the leaders\\' focus today was advancing \"our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific\" region. Biden planned to return to then Washington and host British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the White House late in the afternoon, according to the White House. Administration officials said Biden was trying to set up a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, too. Biden\\'s Tuesday morning speech kicked off a week of global engagements. The White House said Biden hoped to turn the page from conflict to global cooperation and competition. As the president implored countries to \"work together as never before,\" he tried to tamp down fears over the United States\\' increasing competition with China. The day before, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the U.S. and China to avoid a new Cold War and urged them to fix their \"completely dysfunctional relationship.\" On Tuesday, Biden told delegates -- without referencing China by name: \"We are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocks.\" He said common action was needed to deal with climate change, a crisis he noted was \"borderless.\" \"Will we meet the threat of challenging climate, the challenging climate we\\'re all feeling, already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather, or will we suffer the merciless march of ever more of ever-worsening droughts and floods, more intense fires and hurricanes, longer heat waves, and rising seas?\" he said. Biden announced he would work with Congress to try to double international public financing for developing nations to fight climate change. The end goal, with the support of other donors including private capital, would be $100 billion to help developing nations with climate change, he said. Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic has put a focus on special precautions the United Nations was taking to prevent the large, international General Assembly gathering from helping to spread the virus. The U.N. agreed to an \"enhanced cleaning\" of the main podium between leaders speeches, \"changing out microphone heads, re-routing delegations to different \\'green rooms,\\' and the use of air purifiers,\" a senior Biden administration official said. Staff could be seen swapping out the microphone head between speeches Tuesday. Bidens speech followed remarks from Brazilian Prime Minister Jair Bolsonaro, who has refused to get vaccinated, has consistently downplayed the virus\\'s seriousness and was even fined for not wearing a mask in Brazil. During his remarks, Biden sought to rally the world together to curb the pandemic, noting the world\\'s \"shared grief.\" \"We\\'ve lost so much to this devastating pandemic that continues to claim lives around the world, and impacts so much on our existence,\" he said. \"We\\'re mourning more than 4.5 million people, people of every nation, from every background. Each death is individual heartbreak.\" \"But our shared grief is a poignant reminder that our collective future will hinge on our ability to recognize our common humanity, and to act together,\" he added. On Wednesday, Biden will host a virtual summit on COVID-19 to \"rally the world urgently to work towards ending this pandemic as rapidly as possible and building our systems better to be able to handle the next pandemic,\" the White House has said. \"He believes that it is high time for the world to come together and not just national leaders,\" a senior adviser said, previewing the summit. \"But he\\'s placing a heavy emphasis on international institutions, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, all of the actors who collectively have the capacity to beat COVID-19. And he is going to call for an all-hands-on-deck effort that can end this pandemic much more rapidly than if we allow for things to unfold without the kind of focus sustained energy and effort that is required.\" The United States will also have a series of announcements about its own further contributions beyond what we\\'ve already contributed to ending the pandemic globally, according to the senior administration official. On Friday, in addition to the first in-person meeting of the Quad countries -- India, Japan, Australia and the U.S. -- in Washington, Biden planned hold individual meetings with India\\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan. ABC News\\' Justin Gomez contributed to this report.\\nThe House could vote on the reintroduced bill this fall. House Democrats on Tuesday released a new package of measures to limit presidential power, a rebuke of former President Donald Trump and designed with the Biden White House to prevent future presidents from breaking traditional ethics and governing norms. \"Donald Trump made this legislation a necessity, but this is bigger than any one president,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a news conference. \"It\\'s about our values, our ideals and our future.\" The Protecting Our Democracy Act would speed up the enforcement of congressional subpoenas -- which were routinely ignored by the Trump administration -- and require administration officials to pay any court fines and legal fees. After Trump refused to acknowledge Joe Biden\\'s election victory and disrupted the transition, the bill proposes starting the transition process within five days of the election and would allow both campaigns to receive government briefings and make other preparations. It would also require presidents and candidates to submit years of income tax returns to the Federal Election Commission for public release -- after Trump refused to release his returns as a candidate and as commander-in-chief, arguing that an ongoing Internal Revenue Service audit prevented him from doing so. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the proposal would prevent presidents from using their office as a \"get-out-of-jail-free card,\" by suspending the statute of limitations for crimes committed by a president or vice president while they are in office. Schiff said the House could vote on the package later this fall. But it\\'s unclear if it has the support of at least 10 Republicans in the Senate to clear the filibuster and 60-vote threshold for legislation. \"I realize many of the Republican members live in fear of angry statements from the former president,\" Schiff said. Many of the underlying bills in the package, including proposals to beef up protections for whistleblowers and independent inspectors general at government agencies, have bipartisan support -- suggesting that Democrats could have more success in the Senate if they take it up piecemeal. The Biden administration has worked \"very constructively\" with Democrats for months on the package, Schiff said. The White House asked lawmakers to exempt administration officials from court fines if they are instructed to ignore subpoenas by the president. The version of the bill unveiled Tuesday also did not include earlier language requiring the White House to turn over presidential communications to Congress.\\nThis report is a part of \"America Strong,\" an ABC News series highlighting stories of strength and resiliency across the nation. Betty Reid Soskin became a national park ranger at the age of 85. A decade and a half later, she celebrated her 100th birthday and said she\\'s still got work to do. \"People need heroes,\" said Soskin. \"And I\\'m maybe one of those.\" Soskin was born on Sept. 22, 1921, in Detroit, Michigan. She said she wanted to become a park ranger to set an example and educate others on Black women in history and the contribution of all women during World War II. For her birthday this year, Soskin\\'s community of Richmond, California, decided it was her turn for the spotlight. They dedicated a middle school, the Betty Reid Soskin Middle School, to the life-long learner herself. Soskin said she hopes to continue inspiring others to follow their dreams. \"I think it\\'s important we all follow our passions,\" said Soskin. \"We all need passions.\"\\nPresident Joe Biden for the first time admitted the diplomatic fallout with France over a recent defense deal could have been better handled, the White House said Wednesday in a joint statement with French President Emmanuel Macron\\'s office. Biden and Macron spoke on the phone Wednesday, in a bid to smooth over the diplomatic fallout from a defense partnership the U.S. struck with Australia and the United Kingdom. \"The two leaders agreed that the situation would have benefitted from open consultations among allies on matters of strategic interest to France and our European partners,\" the statement from the White House and the Elysee Palace said. \"President Biden conveyed his ongoing commitment in that regard.\" The reconciliatory note could signal that France may tone down its criticism of Biden after he agreed to share nuclear submarine technology with Australia. France\\'s leaders have compared Biden to his predecessor, President Donald Trump, saying the U.S. surprised France, a key ally, with the agreement -- which resulted in Australia scuttling a major deal that had been underway with France. White House press secretary Jen Psaki wouldn\\'t say Biden apologized, when asked by a reporter. \"He acknowledged there could have been greater consultation,\" she said during a briefing on Wednesday. \"But again, this call was really focused on the path forward and returning back to normal and the important work we have to do with the French ahead.\" Psaki also did not address a small difference in the English-language version of the joint statement released by the White House and the French-language version released by the Elysee Palace. In English, the statement read that the two men \"agreed that the situation would have benefitted from open consultations,\" while in French, it said they \"agreed that open consultations... would have helped avoid this situation.\" Biden and Macron plan to meet in Europe in October, according to the statement. Biden is set to head to Glasgow, Scotland, that month for a summit on the climate crisis, although the two sides did not say where the leaders planned to meet. Meanwhile, Macron will return the French ambassador to Washington next week -- France had recalled him in response to the defense news -- and the ambassador will who will \"then start intensive work with senior U.S, officials,\" the statement reads. The two leaders \"have decided to open a process of in-depth consultations, aimed at creating the conditions for ensuring confidence and proposing concrete measures toward common objectives,\" the White House and the Elysee Palace said. \"They will meet in Europe at the end of October to reach shared understandings and maintain momentum in this process.\" The statement also said Biden \"reaffirms the strategic importance of French and European engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.\" Psaki said Biden held only himself responsible for recent developments. \"We always look to assess how we can make improvements to how we do consultations,\" she said.\\nAs Walt Disney once said, \"When youre curious, you find lots of interesting things to do.\" And, as a Disney Parks Blog fan, you are definitely more curious than others about new Disney experiences!

The group - which includes collaborators from Disneys Animals, Science and Environment team, The Wilds, George Mason University, the South-East Zoo Alliance for Reproduction & Conservation, The Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW) at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden, and the Animal TB Research Group from Stellenbosch University, South Africa - plans to work together to help ensure the success and sustainment of thriving rhino populations in zoos and other accredited facilities. Wild rhino populations continue to dwindle due to an alarming amount of illegal poaching. Sadly, theyre still hunted for their horns, which continue to be used as status symbols and in some forms of traditional medicine. Because of this, managed rhino populations in accredited facilities are becoming increasingly important for the survival of the species. I feel fortunate to work up close with these majestic animals at Disneys Animal Kingdom Theme Park, where we are able to provide guests with an opportunity to learn more about this endangered species and the threats they face in the wild. Seeing a member of our rhino crash - or family - up close on Kilimanjaro Safaris creates a lasting memory for our guests and helps inspire future generations to aid in their conservation. And through the Species Survival Plan, which is overseen by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to ensure the responsible breeding of endangered species, our rhino crash continues to grow. We have had 12 southern white rhinos born at Disneys Animal Kingdom Theme Park to date, including a calf born just this month, with another due later this year. The groups research will focus on four priority areas identified by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA) Rhinoceros Research Council in 2019: Physical fitness and its role in the overall health of rhinos. Iron storage in browsing rhinos - essentially, ensuring they have the right amounts of key nutrients including iron. Reproductive success, ensuring healthy populations. How behavior and environmental factors may help the well-being of rhinos. While each of these four areas is critical, together they provide a holistic view of how to ensure the best care of rhinos in accredited facilities. This collaborative research will take place over the course of three years before it is compiled and shared with veterinarians and animal care staff at the 74 AZA facilities currently caring for rhinos. By working together and combining forces, this extraordinary team of experts will provide a basis for recommendations to help ensure rhinos receive the best care and that theyre around for multiple generations to enjoy!\\nHiya, foodies!

From the immense pride of being part of this milestone in our history, to the nostalgia of looking back and celebrating every moment thats brought us to today, its safe to say this anniversary will be truly magical. Take one look at Magic Kingdom Park these days, and you can tell something really special is about to happen. Weve put a lot of love and investment into this magical place recently, refurbishing and repainting beloved attractions like Jungle Cruise and Buzz Lightyears Space Ranger Spin, adding brighter and more dimensional colors to fan-favorite areas, and--of course--adorning the park and Cinderella Castle with breathtaking EARidescent decor. From the very highest 189-foot turret soaring above the castle to the pathways beneath your feet taking you from one magical land to the next, every detail--big and small, high and low--has been embellished for this momentous occasion. In true Disney fashion, the details make all the difference. Walking the park for your day of fun and adventure, you may not even notice the colorful variegated gold adorning your favorite areas, the enhanced marquees shining throughout the park, or even the hand-painted murals added to the facades in Adventureland and Fantasyland. Prince Charming Regal Carrousel looks absolutely stunning, with true gold accents and the ornate railing being restored to its original day glory. Every inch looks as beautiful as ever. But my personal favorite? The incredibly symbolic gold leaf detail of the \"5\" and \"0\" on the \"its a small world\" clock tower... its ever so slight but represents so much for us and this place we all love. These subtle features are everywhere--on the rooftops, in the concrete and everywhere in between--just look and you may find your new favorite spot.

Douglas County Judge Sally Pokorny sentenced Lawrence massage therapist Shawn P. OBrien, 50, on Friday after jurors in August found him guilty on eight counts. Three of the charges accuse OBrien of indecent liberties with a child under the age of 14 for fondling a girl who was either 9 or 10 on three occasions between 2013 and 2015. All three resulted in \"hard 25\" sentences, meaning he will have to serve at least 25 years before being eligible for parole. Pokorny said the three life sentences would be served concurrently, the Lawrence Journal-World reported. The other five charges accuse him of sexual battery for fondling four women while giving them a massage to treat sports-related issues between 2016 and 2019. Three of the women played for the University of Kansas soccer team. The fourth woman was a university student who was a client at his office. OBrien had a contract with the university to provide massage treatments to many athletes on campus. That contract was terminated after initial charges were filed. Deputy District Attorney Joshua Seiden told jurors during closing arguments that OBrien used his credentials as a professional massage therapist as a guise to fondle the victims when he was giving them massages. Seiden also pointed to the testimony from the soccer players who said that OBrien fondled them while he was providing massage therapy for the team. He said OBrien claimed to not remember any of the incidents with the athletes. Defense attorney Philip Sedgwick argued that the case came down to a \"he said, she said\" situation and suggested the prosecutors did not present enough evidence to convict OBrien. He said athletes did not complain about his methods or let him know that what he was doing made them uncomfortable.\\nIt\\'s in response to the new Texas law that bans nearly all abortions. The House on Friday passed a bill to uphold abortion rights for women, taking swift action in response to a new Texas law that bans nearly all abortions in the state. The final tally was 218-211 with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing the vote. The House bill has little chance of becoming law and is largely symbolic given Republican opposition in the Senate. Shortly after, Senate Majority Leader Schumer announced that the Senate will soon take up and vote on the House-passed legislation, but to advance it would require the support of at least 10 Republicans, and it is not clear all Democrats would support it, either. The House bill would codify protections provided by the Supreme Courts landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which legalized womens right to an abortion. The Texas law that passed in September prohibits abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy and allows \"any person, other than an officer or employee of state or local government,\" to bring a civil suit against someone believed to have \"aided or abetted\" an unlawful abortion. People who successfully sue an abortion provider under this law could be awarded at least $10,000. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the so-called \"heartbeat ban\" on May 19 and it went into effect on Sept. 1. The U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4 on Sept. 1 to allow SB8 to take effect on procedural grounds, despite what the majority acknowledged as \"serious questions\" about constitutionality. The justices did not address those questions. Pelosi has said taking congressional action would make a \"tremendous difference\" in Democrats\\' efforts to maintain access to abortion rights. She called the Supreme Court\\'s decision \"shameful.\" Ahead of Fridays vote, Pelosi said the House legislation should \"send a very positive message to the women of our country -- but not just the women, to the women and their families, to everyone who values freedom, honors our Constitution and respects women.\" Since Texas\\'s abortion ban went into effect, lawmakers in 11 states, including Florida, have announced intentions or plans to model legislation after the state\\'s law, according to NARAL Pro-Choice America. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in a Mississippi abortion case in early December. The high court is expected to consider the legality of Mississippi\\'s ban on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a law that is intended to challenge Roe v. Wade.

Andrew Craig Ericson, 24, of Muskogee pleaded guilty to parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., according to court documents. In exchange for the plea, prosecutors will drop three related misdemeanor charges. \"I am pleading guilty because I am in fact guilty,\" Ericson said in a signed statement. Ericson\\'s attorney declined comment Friday. Federal prosecutors said Ericson livestreamed himself entering the building with other supporters of then-President Donald Trump and entering the Crypt, Rotunda, and the conference room of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \"While inside the Speakers Conference Room or other office space, the defendant took a beer out of a mini refrigerator,\" according to the documents. Ericson was arrested Jan. 23. He faces up to six months in prison when sentenced Dec. 10.\\nAfter more than a week of growing controversy, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas confirmed Friday that the migrant camp formed in Del Rio, Texas, has been cleared out -- but he said that more than 17,400 migrants -- mostly Haitians -- remain in the United States. \"As of this morning, there are no longer any migrants in the camp, underneath the Del Rio International Bridge,\" Mayorkas said at a White House briefing Friday afternoon. Photos showed the once sprawling and squalid encampment emptied and the area bulldozed -- but the political problem the migrants pose has not gone away. Of those who remain, Mayorkas said, 5,000 are still being processed by the Department of Homeland Security and about 12,400 will have the opportunity to stay in the U.S., have their cases heard before an immigration judge and not be subject to the rapid \"expulsion\" protocols. About 2,000 migrants have been flown directly back to Haiti while about 8,000 returned to Mexico on their own, Mayorkas said. He said that some of those placed in removal proceedings are released in the U.S. with monitoring. ABC News has reported this applies to \"thousands\" of those placed in removal proceedings. \"Individuals, some of them are detained, some of them are placed on alternatives to detention,\" Mayorkas said. \"We remain in touch with them. We monitor them to ensure their appearance in court at the designated time of appearance.\" Removal proceedings can take time, officials said, in part because migrants subject to them are legally allowed to make a claim of asylum. Asylum cases can take anywhere from six months to several years given the massive case backlog at immigration courts across the country. Congressional Democrats have demanded the administration end the removals. Mayorkas said the administration would continue to employ a controversial process of rapid removal or \"expulsion\" known as Title 42 -- a reference to a section of U.S. public health code that the government says requires them to immediately expel unauthorized migrants at the border. Immigrant advocates have raised concerns about Title 42 cutting off access to legal means of obtaining asylum. Mayorkas explained the exceptions to Title 42 which include migrants with unique vulnerabilities, government capacity limitations, and those who meet the legal standards for a claim of torture. \"Others have been moved to different processing facilities along the border in light of operational capacity, and then many of them will be returned to Haiti from there,\" Mayorkas said. \"And if any of the exceptions apply, they will not be returned to Haiti but placed in immigration enforcement proceedings.\" Amid controversy over images of Border Patrol agents on horseback confronting migrants, he echoed President Joe Biden\\'s comments that the images were \"horrible,\" even as he claimed \"I will not prejudge the facts\" while their conduct was still being investigated. \"I do not, in any way, want to impair the integrity of the investigative process,\" he said. \"We have investigators who are looking at it independently.\" Biden said the agents involved \"will pay\" and there would be \"consequences.\" \"I think the president was speaking in terms of the horror that he observed from seeing the images and what they suggest. That investigation will have integrity. I can assure you of that,\" he said. Mayorkas said agents generally had a done a \"heroic\" job dealing with the influx of migrants and that the images \"do not reflect who we are ... or the integrity and values of our truly heroic personnel in the Department of Homeland Security.\" \"We know that those images painfully conjured up the worst elements of our nations ongoing battle against systemic racism,\" Mayorkas said.

The 1,500-pound (680-kilogram) bull, nicknamed Barney or Barnie, was corralled late Wednesday by staff from Skylands Animal Sanctuary and Rescue, Suffolk County SPCA Chief Roy Gross said in a news release. \"Look who we found cruising around Long Island,\" the organization said. \"He is one handsome kid.\" Suffolk County police used drones and helicopters to help capture the bull, who will live out his days at the Skylands sanctuary in Wantage, New Jersey, Gross said. Rescuers had been searching the animal ever since he broke through the fence at a Moriches farm on July 20, but he remained on the lam as residents of the area posted sightings on social media. \"We would like to thank everyone for their support and concern as well as rescue groups who also assisted during this ordeal,\" Gross said. \"Great job of collaboration by all who participated.\"\\nThe state\\'s senior senator will be 89 by Election Day next year. Iowa\\'s senior Republican senator, Chuck Grassley, announced in an early morning tweet Friday that, at age 88, he will seek reelection in 2022. Grassley, who will be 89 by Election Day next year, is proud of his physical fitness, and not-so-subtly bragged about in a tweet announcing his run that showed him jogging before sunrise in Iowa. \"Its 4 a.m. in Iowa so Im running. I do that 6 days a week. Before I start the day I want you to know what Barbara and I have decided,\" Grassley said the tweet. \"Im running for re-election--a lot more to do, for Iowa. We ask and will work for your support. Will you join us?\" The tweet included a clock turning to 4 a.m. and video of him jogging in the dark along a rural road. Even getting close to 90, Grassley is currently only the second oldest member of the Senate, with California Democrat Dianne Feinstein besting him for the title by a matter of months. His physique is a matter of legend on Capitol Hill. He is frequently seen running or walking briskly through the Capitol hallways, and he\\'s known to challenge other senators to push-up contests. (He can do at least 21, perhaps more.) But Grassley\\'s endurance can also be measured by his steady presence on Capitol Hill. He began his career in Washington when he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1975. He\\'s been a member of the Senate since 1980, and currently holds the record for the 10th longest Senate tenure. Grassley currently serves as the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He led the committee for a portion of the Trump administration and aided in the confirmation of Supreme Court nominees and many federal judges that cemented conservative sway of the judiciary. He also served as chair of the Senate Finance Committee for the later half of President Donald Trump\\'s term. With Republicans hoping to retake the now evenly-divided Senate in 2022, Grassley\\'s seat, as well as those of other Republican incumbents up for reelection, will be closely watched. Several long-serving Republican senators are retiring in 2022. Following the announcement of his intent to run, the Iowa Republican Party threw its weight behind the senator. \"The road to a Republican majority runs right through Iowa. Defending this seat should be a top priority for every Iowan looking to stop Joe Biden\\'s chaotic agenda,\" the party said in a statement. \"Sen. Grassley\\'s never-quit attitude has propelled him to be one of the most effective senators in our state\\'s history. Grassley is a lifelong family farmer who understands the value of hard work, community, education, and family.\" Grassley\\'s most likely opponent is former Democratic Iowa Representative Abby Finkenauer, who was narrowly defeated in her 2020 reelection bid for the House. Recent polling be the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll showed Grassley leading Finkenauer by 18 percentage points among likely voters. Finkenauer slammed Grassley in a statement, alleging that the senator has lost touch with Iowa during his lengthy Senate tenure. \"After 47 years in Washington, D.C., Chuck Grassley has changed from an Iowa farmer to just another coastal elite,\" Finkenauer alleged. Grassley\\'s Senate colleagues celebrated his announcement in tweets Friday, praising his work ethic and experience. \"Chuck is a ferocious advocate for the people of Iowa and the conservative cause,\" GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a tweet. \"I have served with Chuck my entire time in the Senate. He is one of the most hardworking, enthusiastic senators I have ever met with a wealth of experience and knowledge.\" ABC News\\' Quinn Scanlan contributed to this report.\\nR. Kellys fate is now in a jurys hands after weeks of lurid testimony in a sexual misconduct trial NEW YORK -- R. Kellys fate is now in a jurys hands after weeks of lurid testimony in his sexual misconduct trial. The panel of seven men and five women began deliberating racketeering and sex trafficking charges against the R&B superstar Friday afternoon, ending the day without reaching a verdict They are due back in court on Monday to resume their work. A couple hours into the deliberations, the jurors sent the judge a note asking to review a transcript of testimony and evidence regarding a woman who claimed Kelly sexually assaulted her in 2003 when she was a 21-year-old radio station intern. She testified she was kept locked up in a recording studio for days and drugged before the assault. Prosecutors and defense attorneys finished their closing arguments this week. The 54-year-old singer is accused of running a Chicago-based criminal enterprise that recruited his accusers for unwanted sex and mental torment. The witnesses said Kelly subjected them to perverse and sadistic whims when they were underage. He has denied any wrongdoing. Kelly \"believed the music, the fame and the celebrity meant he could do whatever he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadia Shihata said in federal court in Brooklyn in a fiery rebuttal to the defense\\'s closing argument that portrayed Kelly as a victim of false accusations. But, she added, \"Hes not a genius, hes a criminal. A predator.\" She added that his alleged victims \"aren\\'t groupies or gold diggers. They\\'re human beings.\" The 54-year-old Kelly, perhaps best known for the 1996 smash hit \"I Believe I Can Fly, \" has pleaded not guilty to racketeering charges accusing him of abusing women, girls and boys for more than two decades. He is also charged with multiple violations of the Mann Act, which makes it illegal to transport anyone across state lines \"for any immoral purpose.\" Prosecutors say their evidence proves how Kelly, with the help of some loyal members of his entourage, used tactics from \"the predator playbook\" to sexually exploit his victims. The tactics included isolating them in hotel rooms or his recording studio, subjecting them to degrading rules like making them call him \"Daddy\" and shooting video recordings -- some seen by the jury at trial -- of them having sex with him and others as a means to control them, prosecutors said. In his closing, defense attorney Deveraux Cannick told the jury that testimony by several accusers was full of lies, and that \"the government let them lie.\" Cannick argued there was no evidence Kelly\\'s accusers were ever forced to do anything against their will. Instead, Cannick said, Kelly\\'s girlfriends stuck around because he spoiled them with free air travel, shopping sprees and fancy dinners -- treatment that belied the predator label. \"He gave them a lavish lifestyle,\" he said. \"Thats not what a predator is supposed to do.\"\\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced a new rule Thursday to reduce super-polluting greenhouse gases commonly used in air conditioners and refrigerators as part of the cooling process. This is a major leap forward in the Biden administration\\'s plan to combat climate change despite the president\\'s $3.5 trillion reconciliation package, which includes an overhaul on climate policy, facing broad opposition from Republicans in Congress. These greenhouse gases, known as hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs, have an impact on warming the climate that is hundreds to thousands of times greater than the same amount of carbon dioxide, senior Biden administration officials said in a call with reporters Wednesday. The rule creates a legal requirement for companies and manufacturers to reduce HFCs and was first proposed in May under the 2020 American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, or AIM. The AIM Act requires the EPA to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs, manage the gases and their substitutes as well as facilitate the transition to new greener technologies. Included in the new rule is the creation of a climate protection program that will phase down the production and consumption of HFCs by 85% within the next 15 years. It\\'s expected the phase down will reduce emissions by the equivalent of 4.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2050. According to the EPA officials, that\\'s equal to nearly three years of emissions from the U.S. power sector. Reducing HFCs is part of the Biden administration\\'s efforts to reduce the effects of climate change while also generating jobs, a key sticking point of his climate policy initiatives. \"This actually reaffirms what President Biden always says when he thinks about climate, he thinks about jobs,\" EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters Wednesday. \"Because this administration knows what\\'s good for the environment is also good for the economy. Transitioning to safer alternatives and more energy-efficient cooling technologies is expected to generate more than $270 billion in cost savings and public health benefits by the year 2050.\" The EPA estimated that by the end of next year, the annual net savings of reducing HFC emissions will be $1.7 billion. The rule also establishes an allowance and trading program to reduce HFCs. In accordance with the AIM Act, companies need an allowance to produce or import any HFCs or HFC-related products. The agency will have the allocation amounts distributed to each company by Oct. 1, according to Joseph Goffman, EPA acting assistant administrator. According to the EPA, along with five other agencies, it will work to prevent the illegal importation and production of HFCs in the U.S. by creating an interagency task force. In the 1990s, the value of seizures of refrigerants at the U.S.-Mexico border were second only to marijuana, according to the advocacy group Environmental Investigation Agency. Stephen Yurek, the president and CEO of the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a policy group that represents the interests of manufacturers, said the institute has supported the rule since the beginning. \"It\\'s great for U.S. industry which are the innovators of the new products. It\\'s great for the economy for jobs and that, but it\\'s also great for the environment,\" Yurek said. \"It\\'s a win-win for everybody.\" Climate advocates welcome the rule as well and that the Biden administration is moving forward to fulfill the requirements of the AIM Act, but some said this is just a starting point. \"It\\'s now imperative to adopt additional rules that ensure a swift transition to new technologies and full lifecycle management of these gases,\" Christina Starr, senior policy analyst at the Environmental Investigation Agency, said in a statement. Danielle Wright, the executive director of the North American Sustainable Refrigeration Council, which works to promote the transition to natural refrigeration agents such as ammonia, said there is no doubt that this rule is an important first step. But the key about the rule is that it is a phase down, not a phase out, she said. It does not create a cost-effective pathway for companies to transition to the gases that have the lowest impact on the climate: natural refrigerants. Switching to these alternative gases for refrigeration and cooling would be the equivalent of switching to electric cars, according to Wright. \"In order to make that an economically viable decision, you need really strong policy,\" Wright said. \"And so this policy is not strong enough to create those economically viable market conditions. It\\'s still an environmental win, but we\\'re not going as far as we could,\" she said. By finalizing this rule, the U.S. will be in line with key components of the Montreal Protocol\\'s Kigali Amendment -- an international agreement aimed at reducing the production of HFCs. However, the U.S. has not ratified the Kigali Amendment to officially join the treaty, and the White House has yet to send the amendment to the Senate for ratification. When asked by reporters when the president would send the amendment to the Senate, national climate adviser Gina McCarthy said she did not have a date for when that will happen. Nonetheless, the EPA is calling this rule a historic step towards reducing the effects of climate change by implementing pollution regulations across multiple industries. \"This is a very proud moment for the EPA, and more importantly for the American people,\" Regan said.\\nJulius Jones, who has spent the past 20 years on death row, has never been closer to freedom, despite the fact that last week, his execution date was set for Nov. 18. The Oklahoma Parole Board voted 3-1 to commute Jones\\' sentence to life in prison with the possibility of parole, and now, the final decision on his fate remains in the hands of Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt. Jones\\' mother, Madeline Davis-Jones, told \"Nightline\" the news is \"magical.\" \"I\\'m still in shock, because it\\'s not over, you know? We still have so much ground [to] cover,\" Jones\\' sister, Antoinette Jones, said. \"I don\\'t know. I can\\'t explain it, but it was a good feeling.\" Antoinette Jones said her brother was calm when he heard the parole board\\'s recommendation, as he knows work still has to be done to secure his freedom. \"He said, \\'I\\'m good. I\\'ll be even better when I get out and I can hug y\\'all and we can start helping change the world,\\'\" Antoinette Jones said. \"It was a relief. I could breathe a little bit easier.\" Jones\\' sister remains hopeful that he will be freed, and said she can picture justice for her brother. \"Julius being able to feel the sun on his skin, the natural sun on his skin. It looks like him having no chains [on] when he gets to go outside,\" she said. \"It looks like freedom.\" Julius Jones was 19 years old when he was arrested for the 1999 murder of Oklahoma businessman Paul Howell, and sentenced to death in 2002. What followed were decades of public scrutiny and relentless work from his legal team. \"We think Julius was wrongfully convicted and that Oklahoma is at risk of executing an innocent man,\" Jones\\' attorney, Amanda Bass, said. Now 41 years old, Jones has spent most of his life behind bars. Even after so many years, his sister and mother have yet to give up hope. Before he was in prison, friends and teachers knew Jones as a champion high school basketball player who attended the University of Oklahoma on an academic scholarship. That all changed in 1999 when Howell, 45, was shot in his family\\'s driveway after a car-jacking in the wealthy suburb of Edmond, Oklahoma. Howell\\'s GMC Suburban went missing and his sister, Megan Tobey, was the only eye-witness. \"Megan Tobey described the shooter as a young black man wearing a red bandana, a white shirt, and a stocking cap or skullcap. She was not able to identify the shooter\\'s face because it was covered,\" Bass told ABC News in 2018. Two days after Howell was killed, police found his Suburban parked in a grocery store parking lot. They learned later that a man named Ladell King had been offering to sell the car. King named Chris Jordan and Julius Jones to investigators and said the two men had asked him to help them sell the stolen Suburban. \"Ladell was interviewed by the lead detectives in this case. He told the police that on the night of the crime, a guy named Chris Jordan comes to his apartment. A few minutes later, according to Ladell King, Julius Jones drives up,\" attorney Dale Baich told ABC News in 2018. King accused Jordan of being the driver and claimed that he and Jones were looking for Suburbans to steal, but it was Jones who shot Howell. \"Both Ladell King and Christopher Jordan were directing police\\'s attention to the home of Julius Jones\\' parents as a place that would have incriminating items of evidence,\" Bass said. Investigators found a gun wrapped in a red bandana in the crawl space of Jones\\' family home. The next day, Jones was arrested for capital murder. Jones\\' attorneys say the evidence police found could have been planned by Jordan. They say Jordan had stayed at Jones\\' house the night after the murder, but Jordan denied those claims during the trial. In the years since, Jones\\' defense team has argued that racial bias and missteps from his then public-defense team played a role. Jones\\' team has submitted files to the parole board that they said proved his innocence, including affidavits and taped video interviews with inmates who had served time in prison with Jordan. They said they allegedly heard Jordan confess to Howell\\'s murder. In a statement to ABC News, Jordan\\'s attorney, Billy Bock, said that \"Chris Jordan maintains his position that his role in the death of Paul Howell was as an accomplice to Julius Jones. Mr. Jordan testified truthfully in the jury trial of Mr. Jones and denies \\'confessing\\' to anyone.\" Jordan served 15 years in prison before he was released. In 2020, Jones\\' story was thrown back into the spotlight when unlikely legal ally Kim Kardashian drew public attention to his case. Kardashian, who is studying to take California\\'s bar exam, has been vocal on the issue of the death penalty and prison reform and has campaigned to free a number of men and women who were incarcerated. \"Kim Kardashian, I felt like maybe one of my sorority sisters ... she was down to earth,\" Davis-Jones said. Antoinette Jones said Kardashian put in the effort to help her brother. \"She sat down and she broke down my brother\\'s case. That means that she actually did the work,\" Jones said. \"She did the work to go back and check certain things, to point out certain things.\" \"The fact that she told me that she was able to go see my brother, it was almost like she took a piece of him and brought it to us and then we could feel like he was there with us,\" Jones added. But despite all the efforts, Julius Jones\\' execution date is still in place. His family said they have to just wait to see if Stitt will agree with the parole board\\'s recommendation and commute Jones\\' November death sentence. Three members of the Pardon and Parole board were appointed by the governor, a fact that gives Davis-Jones some hope. \"I\\'d like for [Stitt] to do the right thing, because the truth will set you free,\" Davis-Jones said. \"But most of all, being in leadership, I know sometimes it\\'s hard ... to make decisions, [but] you have to try to make the right decisions.\"\\nBTS\\' Jungkook: \"Still hard to believe that we did a speech and a performance.\" Korean musical sensation BTS stepped out this week in their new official role as South Korean President Moon Jae-in\\'s special presidential envoys at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. \"It\\'s still hard to believe that we did a speech and a performance,\" BTS\\' Jungkook told ABC News in an exclusive joint interview with Moon Tuesday. \"Being appointed as special envoys ... it felt like time had stopped ... I take [this new appointment] as sign of hope and advancement, which means a lot to me and makes me happy.\" ABC News sat down with Moon and the band to talk about their new roles as \"special presidential envoys for future generations and culture\" to promote global diplomacy and draw in younger generations. \"It was much more effective than the U.N. Secretary General or myself delivering hundreds of speeches,\" Moon said, noting that millions of people have watched the U.N.\\'s stream of the band\\'s speech and live performance. Moon and BTS attended the U.N. General Assembly together to highlight climate action, the pandemic, the importance of vaccines and sustainable development. RM of BTS said there are different ways fans can combat climate change. \"I think that ultimately small changes can make a big difference, starting with proper recycling... awareness of disposable products and [the] use of tumblers,\" he said. In looking ahead to the future, BTS member J-Hope said what the band wants to do most post pandemic is a concert, and said he hopes that \"many people get vaccinated and it becomes an environment where it is possible for us to safely have a concert.\" \"That\\'s what the fans want, and what we want,\" J-Hope continued, adding that he hopes for a day when people can \"talk face to face and give each other hugs again.\" The joint exclusive interview with Moon and BTS will air on Friday Sept. 24, starting with \"Good Morning America.\"\\nLocal lawmakers in San Jose, California, are expected to vote on a resolution next week that would apologize to Chinese immigrants and their descendants for the role the city played in \"systemic and institutional racism\" more than a hundred years after one of the city\\'s thriving Chinatowns was burned by arsonists. San Jose was once home to five Chinatowns built up by immigrants arriving to the U.S. in the late 1800s, according to a memorandum posted to the city\\'s website that acknowledges the pain and unequal treatment suffered by these early Asian American communities. \"These early Chinese immigrants were met with virulent, systematic racism, xenophobia and the violence of anti-Chinese forces from early on and were regularly denied equal protection before the law,\" the memo states. \"In addition to federal legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, City policies, resolutions, and other actions of the City of San Jose and the City Council directly contributed to the xenophobic discrimination and racial violence faced by Chinese immigrants.\" The public apology would come as biases related to the COVID-19 pandemic\\'s suspected origins in Wuhan, China, have led to a new surge in anti-Asian hate incidents throughout the country. The memo notes how one of the most well-known of San Jose\\'s Chinatowns succumbed to arson in 1887 after the city council at the time declared the site a public nuisance and ordered it removed to make way for the construction of a new city hall. The blaze displaced some 1,400 people and destroyed homes and businesses. A plaque erected in 1987 on the Fairmont Hotel -- which sits on the site of the former Chinatown -- acknowledges the atrocities, but the memo notes that there \"has been no formal accountability\" for the city\\'s policies that led to the arson. The resolution seeks to change this. A draft of the resolution chronicles the contributions Chinese immigrants made to the local economy, as well as the violence and racism they faced -- noting how the first church in 1869 to teach Sunday school to Chinese immigrants was burned to the ground and the minister at the time received death threats. The resolution also acknowledges the still-persisting impacts of centuries of racist policy, stating, \"the recent rise in anti-Asian violence and racial discrimination demonstrates that xenophobia remains deeply rooted in our society\" and that \"Asian-Americans are still considered perpetual foreigners.\" It calls for the story of Chinese immigrants \"and the dehumanizing atrocities committed against them in the 19th and early 20th century\" to not be purged from the city\\'s history. \"The City must acknowledge and take responsibility for the legacy of discrimination against early Chinese immigrants as part of our collective consciousness that helps contribute to the current surge in anti-Asian and Pacific Islander hate,\" it states. The resolution seeks to apologize to all Chinese immigrants and their descendants, acknowledge the injustices and brutality, as well as recognize the contributions and resilience of the Chinese community. Connie Young Yu, the author of \"Chinatown, San Jose, USA,\" told ABC News in a statement the apology would have \"great personal significance\" since her grandfather was a teenage refugee from the 1887 fire and her father was born in the new San Jose Chinatown. \"The apology by the City of San Jose for anti-Chinese policies comes very late, but it is deeply meaningful for the Chinese American community and symbolically offers peace and reconciliation,\" she said. \"The apology recognizes the hardships and struggles of our ancestors by the Chinese Exclusion Act which deprived Chinese naturalization to U.S. citizenship, inciting cities to drive out the Chinese by outlaw violence or legal methods.\" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo told San Francisco ABC station KGO, \"It\\'s appropriate that every generation, we do this.\" \"That we remember this,\" Liccardo added, \"because tragically, these lessons are lost from one generation to another. And even more tragically, history does repeat itself.\" Local members of the Asian American community have welcomed the news. The Chinese Historical and Cultural Project of Santa Clara County in California, a nonprofit advocacy and historical preservation group, has a ceremony planned for next Wednesday to celebrate the adoption of the resolution, which is expected to take place on Tuesday. Evan Low, who became the youngest Asian American legislator ever elected to the California State Assembly in 2014, told KGO that it\\'s \"critical we learn and know about our history and help further the education for our community.\" \"We need to also recognize that accountability helps to heal these wounds,\" Low added.\\nIt comes a day after President Biden met with Democrats at the White House. Democratic House and Senate leaders on Thursday announced they and the White House have reached agreement on a \"framework\" that will pay for most, if not all, of the massive $3.5 trillion human infrastructure bill -- a move meant to mitigate concerns from moderate and centrist Democrats opposed to the hefty price tag. But the leaders provided very little details on the framework a day after President Joe Biden met with Democratic leaders, moderates and progressives at the White House in an effort to save his agenda from Democratic infighting.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also did not provide a clear outline about when the reconciliation bill will be ready for a vote. She also did not commit to putting the bipartisan infrastructure bill on the floor for a vote next Monday, which she had promised moderates would happen. Pelosi was joined by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at her weekly press conference, as Democrats also face a looming possible government shutdown on Oct. 1 and still need to deal with the debt ceiling, which Republicans will not support. \"The White House, the House and the Senate have reached agreement on a framework that will pay for any final negotiated agreement. So, the revenue side of this, we have an agreement on,\" Schumer told reporters. \"We know that we can cover the provisions the president has put forward,\" Pelosi added. \"It\\'s all good.\" This announcement is meant to provide some relief to those moderate, centrist Democrats like Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who do not support that $3.5 trillion number. But Pelosi and Schumer provided very little on actual details. As of right now, leaders are no closer to having a reconciliation bill -- which means the fate of the bipartisan infrastructure bill hangs in the balance. \"We came to terms as to a framework of an array of agreements that we have, depending on what the need is. Now at the same time, we\\'re finalizing on the outlay side, so if we need more, we need less -- that will impact the choices we make there,\" Pelosi said. Pelosi also did not commit to putting the bipartisan infrastructure bill that has already passed in the Senate on the floor next week. \"We take it one day at time,\" Pelosi told reporters. \"I am confident that we will pass both bills.\" Pelosi also did not make clear if $3.5 trillion will remain the topline, or if that figure could change and drop lower. \"This is not about price tag. This is about what is in the bill,\" Pelosi said. Following the press conference, reporters caught up with Pelosi and pressed for more details on the framework. When reporters suggested they had too few details, Pelosi responded, \"well that\\'s your problem, not mine.\" Following the press conference, many senators close to the negotiation table say they are in the dark about the new framework agreement. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders said he has \"no idea\" what the agreement is. He told reporters he hopes to be briefed on it soon \"if there is a framework.\" \"We\\'ve been through this a million times. There are many many approaches as to how you can raise money in a fair and progressive way and raise at least 3.5 trillion dollars,\" Sanders said. \"If that\\'s what the menu is there is nothing then nothing particularly new I think.\" Sen. Mark Warner, a moderate Democrat on the Budget committee who has been intimately involved in negotiations with the president on the reconciliation plan told reporters he has not the \"foggiest idea\" what is in the framework. Warner told reporters he was \"as interested in getting those details as you are.\" Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he was in meetings over the framework, but declined to give many details about what was discussed or decided upon. \"It went right to the heart of what we need in terms of tax fairness in America and that\\'s where we are this morning,\" Wyden said while dodging questions about a topline or any agreed to \"payfors.\" Senators said they expected to receive more information from leadership Thursday on what the framework is. Democratic leaders also have to contend with a potential shutdown on Oct. 1, but Pelosi insisted a shutdown would be avoided. Pelosi told reporters Republicans could cave on raising the debt ceiling because \"public sentiment is everything.\" But she indicated that both chambers will do everything they can to keep the government open via a so-called \"continuing resolution\" that maintains current funding levels, which may mean they will have to deal with the debt ceiling at a later time. \"We will keep the government open by September 30 ... and continue the conversation about the debt ceiling. Whatever it is, we will have a CR that passes both houses by September 30,\" Pelosi said.\\nThe Biden administration is imploring Iran to quickly return to talks on its nuclear program after a three-month hiatus caused by its government transition NEW YORK -- The Biden administration is imploring Iran to quickly return to talks on its nuclear program after a three-month hiatus caused by its government transition, warning that the window for negotiations may soon close. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and a senior administration official said Thursday that U.S. patience is wearing thin and that further delays while Iran continues to expand its atomic capabilities could lead Washington and its partners to conclude a return to the landmark 2015 nuclear deal is no longer worthwhile. \"We dont have yet an agreement by Iran to return to the talks in Vienna,\" Blinken said. \"We are very much prepared to return to Vienna and continue the talks. The question is whether, and if so when, Iran is prepared to do that.\" Blinken and the senior official, who briefed reporters on condition that he not be identified by name, spoke as diplomats from the remaining parties to the agreement have been meeting Irans foreign minister on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly to gauge Tehrans willingness to return to the talks. While Iran has said it is ready to rejoin the talks, it has not yet offered a date for a resumption, named a negotiating team or indicated that it is willing to pick up where the negotiations left off in June, according to the officials. In discussions with representatives from the remaining parties to the deal -- Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union -- the officials said all of them had agreed on the importance of resuming the talks as soon as possible. If the talks don\\'t resume, the officials said the U.S. would at some point determine that Iran was no longer interested in the benefits that the accord offered or that its recent technological advances could not be undone by the limits it imposed. \"The possibility of getting back to mutual compliance is not indefinite,\" Blinken said. \"And the challenge right now is that with every passing day, as Iran continues to take actions that are not in compliance with the agreement ... we will get to a point at some point in the future at which simply returning to mutual compliance with the JCPOA will not recapture the benefits.\" The UN\\'s atomic watchdog has said Iran is increasingly in violation of the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, which former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from in 2018. The U.S. has participated indirectly in the Vienna talks, which were aimed at bringing both Washington and Tehran back into compliance with the deal. The EU\\'s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, met Tuesday with Iran\\'s new foreign minister, who reiterated Tehrans \"willingness to resume negotiations at an early date,\" the EU said. Borrell then met Wednesday with Blinken. Borrell stressed \"the need for full cooperation\" from Iran and reiterated his concern about the overall trajectory of the Iranian nuclear program,\" the EU statement said. The last round of talks in Vienna ended in June, ahead of Irans elections that boosted the ranks of hard-liners. There had been speculation that the remaining parties to the deal would meet on the sidelines of this weeks U.N. General Assembly. But the U.S. official said Iran had declined the opportunity to meet.\\nFamilies across the country are using social media to boost their cases. The national spotlight on Gabby Petito\\'s disappearance has given families of other missing persons hope that they too can amplify their stories and find loves ones. Petito made headlines after she went missing on a cross-country road trip with her boyfriend earlier this month. A body found over the weekend near Grand Teton National Park was confirmed to be hers on Tuesday. The coroner said she died by homicide, but the cause of death is pending final autopsy results. Petito is just one of thousands reported missing each year -- the FBI had over 89,000 active missing persons at the end of 2020. Her case also highlighted racial disparities in coverage of such cases as 45% of missing persons last year were people of color, according to the FBI\\'s National Crime Information Center. The Petito case also has become a point of heartbreak for other families, including the sister of Maya Millete, a California mother missing since January. \"I know the circumstances of Gabby\\'s case are different but it just brought back a lot of pain,\" Maricris Droualillet told ABC San Diego affiliate KGTV. Michael Alcazar, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former New York Police Department detective, told ABC News the Petito case became a national frenzy because she seemed familiar to them. \"I think people see her as someone in their family, perhaps their child or they might see themselves as Gabby, a girlfriend or daughter,\" Alcazar said. \"I think it\\'s like a \\'damsel in distress\\' syndrome. That\\'s just the culture in America -- we want to protect the females.\" Her case, Alcazar added, showed the \"value of social media posts and how it propelled this case nationally,\" and how other people may jump on the trend to \"put pressure on law enforcement to utilize their manpower to solve these cases that have been going on for months.\" The pressure could prompt police to reprioritize cases or recruit more help, as in Petito\\'s case, which got FBI assistance. He pointed to the cracking of the case of a 4-year-old girl who was murdered in 1991. Dubbed Baby Hope for 22 years, she finally was identified as Anjelica Castillo. The case went cold but was reopened in 2013, finally solved through a tip. \"On his 20th anniversary, our Chief Joseph Reznick put up more posters regarding the Baby Hope case,\" Alcazar explained. \"I think we might have posted it in our Crime Stoppers kit. That\\'s how we finally were able to identify Baby Hope -- somebody 20 years later called in a tip. That was through social media.\" Here\\'s a snapshot of families pushing forward with their own missing cases, hoping to find a break: Jelani Day In Illinois, a search was launched for Jelani Day, a 25-year-old graduate student at Illinois State University last seen on Aug. 24, according to the Bloomington Police Department. A body found near the Illinois River was identified as Day on Thursday after this story was initially published, Bloomington Police announced. \"Currently the cause of death is unknown, pending further investigation, and toxicology testing,\" the police said in a statement. He was reported missing Aug. 25 by his family and an ISU faculty member. He had not shown up to class the past several days before he disappeared, police said in a statement. Day was captured on surveillance footage entering a retail store called \"Beyond/Hello\" in Bloomington around 9 a.m. on Aug. 24, wearing a blue Detroit Lions baseball hat, a black T-shirt with a Jimi Hendrix graphic, white and silver shorts, and black shoes with white soles. Police found his vehicle, a white 2010 Chrysler 300, two days later in a wooded area concealed by trees. Inside, cops found the clothing he was seen wearing in the video footage but no other sign of him. Bloomington Police said in a Sept. 5 statement that a search team found an unidentified body off the south bank of the Illinois River. The LaSalle County Coroner\\'s Office initially said the identification process could take a few weeks. Day\\'s heartbroken mother, Carmen Bolden Day, pleaded for him to be found. \"I shouldn\\'t have to beg, I shouldn\\'t have to plead, I shouldn\\'t have to feel that there is a racial disparity ... I want these people that have their resources to realize this could happen to them,\" she said on \"Good Morning America.\" Anyone with information about Jelani Day is asked to contact BPD Detective Paul Jones at 309-434-2548 or at Pjones@cityblm.org Daniel Robinson A 24-year-old geologist, Daniel Robinson, went missing outside Buckeye, Arizona, three months ago. The Buckeye Police Department said in an update last week that the search is ongoing. Robinson was last seen June 23 after leaving a job site near Sun Valley Parkway and Cactus Road, and he didn\\'t tell anyone where he was going, police said. His jeep was found turned over in a ravine on July 19, 4 miles from where he was last seen, officials said. The airbags in the car had deployed and initial evidence indicated Daniel was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident. Officials found clothes, his cell phone, wallet and keys. Later in July, a human skull was found south of where the Jeep was recovered, but it was determined that it didn\\'t belong to Daniel, police said. No other remains were found. Investigators have used ATVs, cadaver dogs and a drone and a helicopter to search for Robinson. His family has organized their own searches in the scorching desert. Robinson\\'s father, David Robinson, traveled 2,000 miles from South Carolina to Arizona to help search for his son. \"I\\'m not leaving,\" he told ABC Phoenix affiliate KNX. \"I\\'m not leaving until I find my son.\" Anyone with information that can help solve this case is urged to call the Buckeye Police Department non-emergency number at 623-349-6400. Lauren Cho Lauren Cho, a 30-year-old from New Jersey also known as \"El\", was last seen leaving a residence around 5 p.m. on June 28 in Yucca Valley in California, police said in a statement. She hasn\\'t been seen or heard from since then. She had moved to California from New Jersey eight months earlier. On Tuesday, the Morongo Basic Sheriff\\'s Station announced that investigators from the Specialized Investigations Division, experts in homicides and suspicious deaths, are assisting in the search effort, investigating leads and working with Cho\\'s family and friends. Detectives with the Morongo Basin Station have executed a search warrant in the 8600 block of Benmar Trail, where she was last seen reportedly walking away from the residence, and conducted aerial searches of a remote mountain terrain nearby. Anyone with information regarding the search for Ms. Cho is urged to contact Detective Edward Hernandez or Sergeant Justin Giles, Specialized Investigations Division, at (909) 387-3589. You may remain anonymous by contacting the We-Tip hotline at 800-78-CRIME (27463) or www.wetip.com. Maya Millete Meanwhile in California, family members of Maya Millete, a married Chula Vista mother of three, are still searching for her after more than eight months after she was last seen. Millete, 39, disappeared on Jan. 7 without a trace. Droualillet, Millete\\'s sister, said the attention of the Petito case has become a painful reminder of Maya\\'s unknown whereabouts. \"I know Chula Vista police are working very hard, but the urgency we see in this case is heartbreaking,\" Droualillet told KGTV. The Chula Vista Police Department is working with the San Diego County District Attorney\\'s office, the FBI and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. On July 22, Larry Millete, Maya\\'s husband, was named a person of interest in the case. The Chula Vista Police Department said its interviewed 79 individuals and written 64 search warrants for residences, vehicles, cell and electric devices, and social media data in the case in a statement published Sept. 9. Anyone who may have any information regarding May\\'s disappearance is asked to please contact San Diego County Crime Stoppers at 888-580-8477 or the CVPD at 619-691-5151.\\nPresident Joe Biden on Friday harshly criticized the action of some Border Patrol agents, mounted on horseback, who confronted Haitian migrants crossing the border into Texas, calling their actions \"horrible.\" \"It\\'s outrageous, I promise you, those people will pay,\" Biden said. Biden\\'s blunt statements came as the situation and the agents\\' conduct are still under investigation and the agents have been placed on administrative duties. The use of horses has been suspended in the meantime. Biden was responding to a question from ABC News Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott, who asked, \"You said on the campaign trail that you were going to restore the moral standing of the U.S., that you are going to immediately end Trump\\'s assault on the dignity of immigrant communities. Given what we saw at the border this week, have you failed in that promise? And this is happening under your watch--do you take responsibility for the chaos that\\'s unfolding?\" \"Of course, I take responsibility,\" Biden said, but he then quickly shifted to the controversial images of the agents on horseback. \"I\\'m president but it was horrible to see what you saw to see people treat it like they did -- horses family nearly running over people being strapped. It\\'s outrageous, I promise you, those people will pay. They will be -- there is investigation underway now, and there will be consequences. There will be consequences. It\\'s an embarrassment, beyond an embarrassment. It\\'s dangerous. It\\'s wrong, it sends the wrong message around the world, sends the wrong message at home. It\\'s simply not who we are,\" he said. The Border Patrol agents\\' union quickly disputed Biden\\'s characterization. \"Even though the White House acknowledged there is an ongoing investigation, saying that the agents \"will pay\" shows that they aren\\'t truly interested in the results. The photographer who took the photos said that nobody was whipped. Deciding they did something wrong without any form of due process -- that should not be who we are,\" Border Patrol Council Vice President Jon Anfinsen said. Democrats, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus, have demanded an end to the Haitians being expelled and the ACLU and other migrant advocates have had the administration is illegally removing them through the use of Title 42, claiming they are justified in doing so for public health reasons because of the pandemic. The U.S. special envoy for Haiti, Daniel Foote, has resigned in protest over the administration policy, calling the treatment of the Haitian migrants \"inhumane.\"\\nFormer President Barack Obama\\'s presidential center will move another step closer to its brick-and-mortar future next week when ground is broken after years of reviews, other delays and local opposition WASHINGTON -- Former President Barack Obama\\'s presidential center will move another step closer to its brick-and-mortar future next week when ground is broken after years of reviews, other delays and continued local opposition. Obama and his wife, Michelle, will join Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot in Chicago on Tuesday for a groundbreaking ceremony for the Obama Presidential Center. \"Michelle and I could not be more excited to break ground on the Obama Presidential Center in the community that we love,\" the former president says, seated beside his wife, in a video announcement shared first with The Associated Press. The former president in 2016 chose a site in a historic lakefront park on the South Side of Chicago to build his presidential library, near where he began his political career, met and married his wife and lived with their family. The former first lady grew up on Chicago\\'s South Side. But the planning process hit numerous snags due to a legal battle with park preservationists and protests from neighborhood activists who feared the planned $500 million center would displace Black residents. Chicagos City Council has since approved neighborhood protections, and a four-year federal review process that was needed because of its location in Jackson Park -- which is on the National Register of Historic Places -- was recently completed. Officials announced in February that construction would begin this year, starting with the relocation of utility lines followed by actual construction. \"This project has reminded us why the South Side and the people who live here are so special,\" the former first lady said in the video, adding that the effort has reaffirmed for her and her husband that the future on the South Side of Chicago \"is as bright as it is anywhere.\" Barack Obama has described the center as a hub for youth programming and public gatherings that will jumpstart the economy on the citys South Side, parts of which are impoverished, by bringing attention, jobs and visitors. Foundation officials estimate the center will help create about 5,000 jobs, both during and after construction. Funding will be raised through private donations. The complex will sit on 19 acres of the 540-acre Jackson Park and include a museum, public library branch, athletic center, childrens play area and a test kitchen. Obamas presidential papers will be available in digital form. The Obama Foundation will also donate up to $3.5 million toward a public track and field facility in the area, city officials have said. ------ Associated Press writer Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report.\\nSome of the nations most aggressive COVID-19 vaccine mandates are scheduled to take effect Monday in New York amid continued resistance from some to the shots NEW YORK -- Some of the nation\\'s most aggressive COVID-19 vaccine mandates are scheduled to take effect Monday in New York amid continued resistance from some to the shots, leaving hospitals and nursing homes across the state and schools in New York City bracing for possible staff shortages. Many health care workers, including support staff such as cleaners, have still not yet received a required first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine days before a Sept. 27 deadline. That\\'s the same deadline for teachers and school workers in New York City to prove they\\'ve received at least one shot. That left the prospect of potentially thousands of health care workers and teachers being forced off the job next week. Despite calls from unions and administrators to delay the mandates, Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio showed no signs of backing down. \"Every single person who is in your care has the right to know that there is no chance they will be infected by the person in charge of protecting them and their health,\" Hochul, a Democrat, said Thursday. Hospitals and nursing homes were preparing contingency plans that included cutting back on elective surgeries and, at one hospital, halting maternity services. Nursing homes were limiting admissions. The states largest health care provider, Northwell Health, was keeping thousands of volunteers on standby. \"We would like to see some more time to be able to comply and implement the vaccine mandate, because at the end of the day its a situation where were very concerned about our ability to care for the patients,\" said Tom Quatroche, CEO of the Erie County Medical Center Corporation, which operates a busy 573-bed hospital in Buffalo. It anticipates that about 10% of its workforce, or 400 staff members, might still be unvaccinated Monday. Under a contingency plan, the hospital said it would suspend elective inpatient surgeries, temporarily stop accepting ICU transfers from other institutions and reduce hours at clinics. New York is not the only state to require health care workers to get vaccinated. But it has been especially aggressive in pushing for wider vaccinations to help limit the spread of the virus. The mayor and governor said workers had plenty of time to get the shots. The mandate for state health care workers was announced this summer. New York City announced in July that its teachers would need to either get vaccinated or tested for COVID-19 weekly, but it then revoked the test-out option in August. While most school workers have been vaccinated, inducing nearly 90% of teachers as of Thursday, unions representing New York City principals and teachers warned that could still leave the 1 million student school system short of as many as 10,000 teachers, along with other staff such as cafeteria workers and school police officers. Those who dont provide proof of a shot by the end of Monday will not be allowed to return to classrooms Tuesday, which will leave principals scrambling overnight to make sure they have enough substitutes, educators warned. The unions said that while they\\'ve encouraged everyone to get vaccinated, some schools could be dangerously low on staff Tuesday. They pleaded for the mayor to delay the mandate after a judge refused to halt the rule. \"We are concerned. Very, very concerned,\" United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew said. Mark Cannizzaro, the president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, said some schools have as many as 100 staff members not in compliance. De Blasio insisted the city was ready. \"Weve been planning all along. We have a lot of substitutes ready,\" the Democrat said in a radio interview on Friday. \"A lot is going to happen between now and Monday but beyond that, we are ready, even to the tune of, if we need thousands, we have thousands.\" The mandate for health care workers comes as hospitals are already reeling from staff shortages due in part to rising demand, workers retiring and weary employees seeking other jobs after 18 months of the pandemic. There is one option for health care workers who don\\'t want to get the shot, which is to apply for a religious exemption. That would buy them until at least Oct. 12, while a federal judge considers a legal challenge arguing that such exemptions are constitutionally required. Meanwhile, a state judge in Albany agreed to set aside a Monday deadline for court employees to get a first vaccine shot and would hear arguments next week on whether to extend the stay. The CSEA, which represents 5,800 workers, argued that the mandate should have been negotiated and not imposed unilaterally by the court system. Earlier, another judge threw out a last-minute effort Friday by seven health care workers and Republican Niagara County legislator John Syracuse to delay the health care mandate. With time ticking down on the health care mandate, Northwell Health was trying to persuade thousands of holdouts to get vaccinated, including individual meetings with staffers. The systems personnel chief, Maxine Carrington, said they\\'re seeing a lot more appointments being scheduled. \"Ive had personal conversations with team members, and I was asked by one: \\'Are you really going to fire us on the 27th? And I said, lets put that aside for a minute and lets talk about saving your life. Why dont you want to get vaccinated?\" Carrington said. She said staff that refuse the inoculations will \"no longer be qualified for employment.\" As of Thursday, about 90% of Northwell\\'s 74,000 active personnel had been vaccinated. Still, the hospital system acknowledged that it did not expect full compliance and had more than 3,000 retirees, volunteers and health care students on standby, should they be needed. The University of Rochester Medical Center, in the states fourth largest city, announced a two-week pause in scheduling new elective procedures at its Strong Memorial Hospital beginning Monday. It also is temporarily closing two urgent care centers. One wild card is no one knows if a burst of health care workers will simply wait until the last minute to get a jab. One hopeful sign: New York-Presbyterian, one of the state\\'s largest hospital systems, had imposed an earlier vaccination deadline on its workers -- midnight Wednesday -- and reported fewer than 250 of its 48,000 staffers had failed to comply. Spokesperson Alexandra Langan said in an email: \"For those who chose not to comply, they will not continue to work at NYP.\" New York state has been averaging just under 5,000 new COVID-19 cases per day with around 2,300 people hospitalized. Thats far worse than in late June, when around 300 people were testing positive each day statewide. ------ Hill reported from Albany. Associated Press writer Marina Villeneuve, in Albany, contributed to this report.\\nU.S. officials say the Biden administrations special envoy to Haiti has resigned, protesting large-scale expulsions of Haitian migrants to their homeland as it is wracked by civil strife and natural disaster The Biden administrations special envoy to Haiti resigned in protest of \"inhumane\" large-scale expulsions of Haitian migrants to their homeland as it is wracked by civil strife and natural disaster, U.S. officials said Thursday. Daniel Foote was appointed to the position only in July, following the assassination of Haitis President Jovenel Moise. Even before the migrant expulsions from the small Texas border town of Del Rio, the career diplomat was known to be deeply frustrated with what he considered a lack of urgency in Washington and a glacial pace on efforts to improve conditions in Haiti. Foote wrote Secretary of State Antony Blinken that he was stepping down immediately \"with deep disappointment and apologies to those seeking crucial changes.\" \"I will not be associated with the United States inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants to Haiti, a country where American officials are confined to secure compounds because of the danger posed by armed gangs to daily life,\" he wrote. \"Our policy approach to Haiti remains deeply flawed, and my policy recommendations have been ignored and dismissed, when not edited to project a narrative different from my own.\" The State Department criticized Foote for resigning at a critical juncture and pushed back against suggestions that his policy prescriptions were overlooked. \"This is a challenging moment that requires leadership,\" spokesman Ned Price said in a written statement. \"It is unfortunate that, instead of participating in a solutions-oriented policy process, Special Envoy Foote has both resigned and mischaracterized the circumstances of his resignation.\" He added that the role of the president\\'s advisers is to provide him with the best possible advice. \"No ideas are ignored, but not all ideas are good ideas,\" Price said. Footes sudden departure leaves a void in U.S. policy toward Haiti -- U.S. Ambassador Michele Sison is expected to depart soon after being nominated to serve in another State Department post -- and adds another critical voice to the administrations response to Haitians camped on the Texas border. Criticism has been fueled by images that went viral this week of Border Patrol agents on horseback using aggressive tactics against the migrants. Democrats and many pro-immigration groups say efforts to expel thousands of Haitians without giving them a chance to seek asylum violates American principles. The migrant camp has shrunk considerably since surpassing more than 14,000 people on Saturday, with many of them expelled and many others released in the U.S. with notices to report to immigration authorities. The expulsion flights to Haiti began Sunday and there were 10 by the end of Tuesday, according to Haitian officials. U.S. officials say they are ramping up to seven flights a day, which would make it one of the swiftest, large-scale expulsions from the U.S. in decades. At least one top official in Haiti cheered Footes resignation while accusing the Biden administration of violating the rights of Haitian migrants. \"This is the first time we see a U.S. diplomat who has decided to go against the will of the U.S. government,\" Mathias Pierre, Haitis election minister, told The Associated Press. \"We salute that.\" Pierre also criticized Haitis elite, saying they have turned a blind eye because migration fuels the economy. He noted that 35% of Haitis gross domestic product is remittances, with the diaspora, much of it in the U.S., sending roughly $3.8 billion a year. Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry has barely discussed the expulsions in public, saying only that his government is worried about conditions that migrants face on the U.S. border and that it will help those sent back to Haiti. Pierre was far more critical of the U.S. \"While theyre receiving (thousands) of Afghan people, theyre rejecting Haitians while Haiti is in the middle of a crisis: a crisis with the earthquake, a crisis with the assassination of the president and a poverty crisis that is clearly one of the major issues why people are leaving,\" Pierre said. Foote served previously in Haiti as deputy chief of mission and is a former ambassador to Zambia. In his new position, he worked with the U.S. ambassador to support Haiti after the president\\'s assassination. For weeks, he had been quietly pushing in Washington a plan to boost U.S. security assistance to Haiti to pave the way for new presidential elections. But Haiti watchers said he became increasingly disappointed with the pace of decision-making in the administration. \"When someone who is tasked with Haiti policy at the highest level resigns because \\'recommendations are ignored and dismissed its not only troubling, but shows you this administration does not tolerate anyone who wont go along with their distorted view of the facts,\" said Damian Merlo, a Republican strategist who has worked for years on Haiti policy and is now a registered lobbyist for the countrys government. \"Dan Foote is a world class diplomat who refuses to be told what do. I wish more foreign service officers had his courage to stand up and call out their bosses.\" ------ Goodman reported from Miami, Lee from New York on the sidelines of United Nations General Assembly meetings, Coto from San Juan, Puerto Rico and Spagat from San Diego\\nThe delta variant is causing a surge in infections among kids in the U.S. and elsewhere, but experts say there are no strong signs that it is causing more severe disease for young patients Is the delta variant of the coronavirus worse for kids? Experts say there\\'s no strong evidence that it makes children and teens sicker than earlier versions of the virus, although delta has led to a surge in infections among kids because it\\'s more contagious. Delta\\'s ability to spread more easily makes it more of a risk to children and underscores the need for masks in schools and vaccinations for those who are old enough, said Dr. Juan Dumois, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins All Childrens Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida. Weekly infection rates among U.S. children earlier this month topped 250,000, surpassing the wintertime peak, according to data from the American Academy of Pediatrics and Childrens Hospital Association. Since the pandemic began, more than 5 million children in the U.S. have tested positive for COVID-19. The delta variant has been identified in at least 180 countries, according to the World Health Organization. In many of them, the spike in infections has also meant an increase in hospitalizations in young children and teens. In the U.S., the hospitalization rate for COVID-19 was less than 2 per 100,000 children in late August and early September -- similar to the peak last winter, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the portion of kids hospitalized with severe disease hasnt changed significantly. The sheer numbers can make it seem like children are getting sicker with the delta variant, but experts say that does not appear to be the case. Most infected kids have mild infections or no symptoms and do not need to be hospitalized. COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide protection against delta. Among children 12 and older -- who are eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations -- the weekly hospitalization rate in July was 10 times higher for the unvaccinated than those who have had the shots, CDC data show. ------ The AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in this series.

In his resignation letter Foote protested the Biden administration\\'s decision to deport Haitian migrants gathered in Del Rio, Texas. \"I will not be associated with the United States inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants to Haiti, a country where American officials are confined to secure compounds because of the danger posed by armed gangs in control of daily life,\" Foote wrote in the blistering letter obtained by ABC News. \"Our policy approach to Haiti remains deeply flawed, and my recommendations have been ignored and dismissed, when not edited to project a narrative different from my own.\" Ned Price, the State Department\\'s top spokesman, bluntly rejected claims Foote made in his resignation letter. \"For him to say his proposals were ignored is simply false,\" Price said in a statement. \"There have been multiple senior-level policy conversations on Haiti, where all proposals, including those led by Special Envoy Foote, were fully considered in a rigorous and transparent policy process. Some of those proposals were determined to be harmful to our commitment to the promotion of democracy in Haiti and were rejected during the policy process.\" \"It is unfortunate that, instead of participating in a solutions-oriented policy process, Special Envoy Foote has both resigned and mischaracterized the circumstances of his resignation,\" Price said. \"No ideas are ignored, but not all ideas are good ideas,\" he added. \"This is a challenging moment that requires leadership. He failed to take advantage of ample opportunity to raise concerns about migration during his tenure and chose to resign instead.\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki, meanwhile, defended the administrations policies. \"Special envoy Foote had ample opportunity to raise concerns about migration during his tenure,\" Psaki told ABC News White House Correspondent MaryAlice Parks on Thursday. \"He never once did so. Now that wasn\\'t his purview. His purview was, of course, being the special envoy on the ground. His positions were and his views were put forward. They were valued. They were heard. Different policy decisions were made in some circumstances.\" Psaki said that the administration had, in fact, stopped using horse patrols against the Haitians in Del Rio. The Department of Homeland Security had announced the change earlier in the day, saying it was temporary. \"We have taken very specific actions as it relates to the horrific photos that we -- were not going to stand for in this administration,\" Psaki told reporters. \"I don\\'t know if he was referring to that or something else.\" After thousands of Haitians and other migrants took shelter in an encampment under a bridge in the south Texas town of Del Rio, the Biden administration has been removing many back to Haiti and Mexico. It continued to do so Thursday despite demands from Congressional Black Caucus members and other Democrats that they be stopped. The migrant surge comes after Haiti experienced a tumultuous summer. In July, Haiti\\'s president was assassinated, leaving the country politically unstable. A month later, the country was rocked by a devastating earthquake that left thousands dead. And the countries streets are still run by gangs, leaving much of the population vulnerable to daily violence. As many as 12,000 Haitians and other migrants took shelter in an encampment under a bridge in the border town , the Biden administration has been removing many back to Haiti and Mexico.\\nThe TAKE with Rick Klein The bills are either too big to fail or too small to pass. The real danger for Democrats is if they wind up being both to different factions of the party. Democratic leaders charged with making the Biden agenda into law are now asking to look beyond the numbers, which is a useful bit of framing when there is no price tag or legislative language or even bullet points to review. The public debate has obsessed over those same numbers for months. But they actually are beside the point in at least one important sense: What\\'s at stake is more fundamental than how many trillions are spent. The mind-spinning parade of potential horribles -- a government shutdown, a debt default, the failure to pass any further meaningful domestic legislation, all as the pandemic continues and crises collide at the border and abroad -- all fall mainly on the party in power. It makes enactment of President Joe Biden\\'s priorities about responsible and even competent government -- particularly given the lack of help they\\'re getting from Republicans on the basics involved with keeping the economy sound. \"We must succeed,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday. The internal party distrust is real but isn\\'t likely to register among voters. National and battleground polling circulating among Democrats point in the same direction: Biden and his party ran on getting things done without chaos and drama -- facts that are driving the failure-is-not-an-option mindset. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The Biden administration is ramping up deportation flights from the border to Haiti amid intense bipartisan backlash and the resignation of a top official. Daniel Foote, the special envoy for Haiti, wrote a scathing resignation letter blasting the administration\\'s approach to policy on Haiti. \"I will not be associated with the United States inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants to Haiti,\" wrote Foote in his resignation letter obtained by ABC News. Foote went on to outline the dire conditions in the earthquake-ravaged island nation. \"The people of Haiti, mired in poverty, hostage to the terror, kidnappings, robberies and massacres of armed gangs and suffering under a corrupt government with gang alliances, simply cannot support the forced infusion of thousands of returned migrants lacking food, shelter and money without additional, avoidable human tragedy,\" wrote Foote. His evaluation stands in contrast to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\\' assessment of conditions on the ground in Haiti. In remarks during his Monday visit to Del Rio, Texas, Mayorkas told reporters that the country was safe enough to receive migrants. Vice President Kamala Harris ignored questions Thursday about her reaction to Foote\\'s resignation during a meeting with Ghana\\'s president. But Harris, who has been tasked with stemming migration, won\\'t be able to avoid questions much longer -- she\\'s slated to join ABC\\'s \"The View\" on Friday. The TIP with Meg Cunningham Officials from Arizona\\'s partisan-led review of 2020 ballots are finally set to deliver a report detailing their findings to the state Senate on Friday. Nearly 11 months after the election, the conspiracy-driven dispute of the results continues to dominate the GOP. On Thursday, former President Donald Trump wrote to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, asking for him to add an audit of the 2020 election to the legislature\\'s special session -- and then later that night, the Texas Secretary of State\\'s office announced a \"full forensic audit\" of 2020 results in four counties. Early drafts of the report obtained by Phoenix ABC affiliate KNXV-TV yielded a total that was not substantially different than what Maricopa County reported after the election, confirming for those skeptical that President Joe Biden won Arizona. Still, Maricopa County warned that the entire report was \"littered with errors and faulty conclusions\" about the 2020 election. Election experts have warned since the beginning of the process that the results will not be trustworthy. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs wrote in a report that the audit consisted of \"faulty and inconsistently-applied procedures and processes.\" The audit overall took months longer than expected -- and ended up with a nearly $6 million price tag. The majority of the bill was covered by private fundraising to groups that align with \"Stop the Steal\" activists, like Michael Flynn and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne. ONE MORE THING The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot issued its first subpoenas Thursday to four former senior Trump administration officials, including former President Donald Trump\\'s longest-serving aide and last chief of staff.

Vice President Kamala Harris\\' interview on \"The View\" on Friday was delayed after two co-hosts tested positive for COVID-19. Harris, who was supposed to appear in-studio with the co-hosts of the show, instead appeared remotely from another room after Ana Navarro and Sunny Hostin were said to have tested positive. Speaking with the two remaining co-hosts, Joy Behar and Sara Haines, the vice president said the treatment of Haitian migrants on the southwest U.S. border was \"horrible and deeply troubling.\" \"Human beings shouldn\\'t be treated that way,\" Harris said. \"And as we all know, it also evoked images of some of the worst moments of our history, where that kind of behavior has been used against the indigenous people of our country, has been used against African Americans during times of slavery.\" The show began with the four co-hosts sitting at the host\\'s table for the start of the show; Navarro and Hostin were quickly ushered off the set before Harris\\' intended appearance. The other co-hosts said Navarro and Hostin had been vaccinated against the virus. \"This is going to be a major news story in a minute now,\" Behar said when she first announced the news. \"Sunny and Ana apparently just tested positive for COVID.\" Harris\\' deputy press secretary, Sabrina Singh, said in a statement that the vice president \"did not have contact with the hosts before the show\" and that Harris\\'s Friday schedule would \"continue as planned.\" But the interview was delayed for much of the show as producers and the U.S. Secret Service took precautions to make sure the vice president would remain safe. When Harris did appear for her interview, she noted the effectiveness of the vaccines since the anchors did not appear to have any noticeable, or severe, symptoms. \"Sunny and Ana are strong women and I know they\\'re fine,\" Harris said. \"But it really does speak to the fact that they\\'re vaccinated and vaccines really make all the difference...\" Harris also answered questions about COVID-19, Afghanistan and abortion access -- with sharp words about Haitians at the border. When asked about asylum applications from migrants, she said she and Biden believe the administration has to do more to support Haiti itself. \"Haiti is our neighbor,\" Harris said. \"The United States has to help and we have to do more and our administration feels strongly about that.\" On Friday morning, President Joe Biden told ABC News Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott that, as president, he took responsibility for the photos and videos coming from the border of mounted police units confronting Haitian migrants. \"It\\'s an embarrassment, beyond an embarrassment. It\\'s dangerous. It\\'s wrong,\" Biden said. \"It sends the wrong message around the world, sends the wrong message at home.\" On Thursday, the U.S. Border Patrol announced it would put a pause on agents on horseback. The president earlier this year tasked Harris with serving as his point person on stemming the flow of migration from Central America to the United States. Earlier in the week, the vice president had condemned the ways Border Patrol agents were shown to be treating migrants. ABC News\\' Molly Nagle contributed reporting.\\nBitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies dipped in value on Friday after China declared all transactions involving these digital currencies \"illegal.\" China\\'s central bank, the People\\'s Bank of China, issued a statement on Friday saying that use of these virtual currencies is disrupting economic order and linked to money laundering, fraud and other illicit activities. While Chinese financial institutions already were banned from doing business with cryptocurrencies, the new statement made clear that cryptocurrencies do not have the same status as legal tender and cannot be used as currency in the marketplace. Bitcoin dropped some 8% on the news, but recouped some initial losses and was down by some 5% late Friday morning. Ethereum initially shed more than 10%, but was down by some 7% as of 11:30 am ET, according to Coin Desk data. The notoriously volatile digital currencies are down about 30% from all-time highs in the spring, but Bitcoin still is up some 40% since the start of the year and Ethereum has gained a whopping 290% in 2021. Friday\\'s notice from Beijing also made clear that it\\'s illegal for overseas virtual currency exchanges to provide services to Chinese residents through the internet. The announcement comes as China experiments on a small scale with its own digital currency issued by its central bank, the first to be created by a major economy. The digital yuan is expected to be rolled out at larger scale imminently, and while it has many similarities to current cryptos the major difference is that it can be more easily traced and controlled by the government. U.S. financial markets held steady on the news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both opening relatively flat on Friday. Analysts and investors around the globe have been keeping a close eye on news out of China, however, amid silence on the Evergrande saga. Debt issues plaguing Evergrande, one of China\\'s largest real estate developers, sent global markets tumbling earlier in the week as many predicted a default with possible spillover effects to the larger economy.\\nChinas central bank has declared all transactions involving Bitcoin and other virtual currencies illegal, stepping up a campaign to block use of unofficial digital money BEIJING -- Chinas central bank on Friday declared all transactions involving Bitcoin and other virtual currencies illegal, stepping up a campaign to block use of unofficial digital money. Chinese banks were banned from handling cryptocurrencies in 2013, but the government issued a reminder this year. That reflected official concern cryptocurrency mining and trading might still be going on or the state-run financial system might be indirectly exposed to risks. Friday\\'s notice complained Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies disrupt the financial system and are used in money-laundering and other crimes. \"Virtual currency derivative transactions are all illegal financial activities and are strictly prohibited,\" the Peoples Bank of China said on its website. Promoters of cryptocurrencies say they allow anonymity and flexibility, but Chinese regulators worry they might weaken the ruling Communist Partys control over the financial system and say they might help to conceal criminal activity. The Peoples Bank of China is developing an electronic version of the countrys yuan for cashless transactions that can be tracked and controlled by Beijing.\\nFormer U.S. Vice President Mike Pence says he\\'s hopeful that the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court created during his and President Donald Trumps administration will soon overturn abortion rights in the United States BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that he is hopeful the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court created during his and President Donald Trump\\'s administration will soon overturn abortion rights in the United States. Pence spoke at a forum devoted to demographics and family values in Budapest, Hungary, where conservative leaders from central Europe expressed their anxieties about falling birthrates in the Western world and discussed ways to reverse the trend. \"We see a crisis that brings us here today, a crisis that strikes at the very heart of civilization itself. The erosion of the nuclear family marked by declining marriage rates, rising divorce, widespread abortion and plummeting birth rates,\" Pence said. The Budapest Demographic Summit, which was first held in 2015 and takes place every two years, has become a platform for leaders to denounce illegal migration and urge families to have more children. Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orban has become a political model for right-wing leaders and commentators across the Western world who admire his hard-line opposition to illegal migration and his support for conservative social values. Tucker Carlson, the most popular host on the right-wing Fox News Channel, spent a week broadcasting from Budapest in August where he heaped praise on Hungary under Orbans rule, and made a visit by helicopter to a fence along the countrys southern border. On Wednesday, the Hungarian state news agency reported that Budapest would next year host the Conservative Political Action Conference or CPAC, an annual gathering of primarily U.S. conservative activists and politicians. While Orbans approach to immigration has earned him the admiration of many Western conservatives, they overlook his authoritarian streak -- his consolidation of Hungarys media, erosion of democratic institutions and discrimination against minorities, including asylum seekers and LGBT people. Pence praised how abortion rates have fallen under Orban\\'s leadership. And he voiced hope that things would change in the U.S. as well, recalling that the administration in which he served as vice president appointed 300 conservative judges to the federal courts, including three new justices to the Supreme Court. \"We may well have a fresh start in the cause of life in America,\" Pence said. \"It is our hope and our prayer that in the coming days, a new conservative majority on the Supreme Court of the United States will take action to restore the sanctity of life at the center of American law.\" Pence has spent the months since leaving office building a post-White House operation that has included launching a new political advocacy group, delivering speeches, fundraising and bolstering relationships that could help him should he choose to run for president in 2024. He has tried to position himself as a conservative who can appeal both to his white Evangelical Christian base as well as Trump supporters and those who may have been fond of Trumps policies, but not his pugilistic style. Still, Pence faces an uphill battle after he drew Trumps ire by declining to block the certification of his 2020 election defeat, which the former president still refuses to accept. Orban, the Hungarian leader who faces re-election next year, lamented that conservatives including Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu have faced electoral losses recently. But addressing Pence, he said: \"Vice President, we wish you a comeback as soon as possible.\" Orban also described how Hungary, under his rule since 2010, has used the state \"to shape demographic processes\" by restricting migration and using tax breaks and other state instruments to ensure that having children is beneficial economically for families. Other leaders from the region also addressed the forum, including Serbian President Alexander Vucic, who voiced his concerns about Europes declining population growth relative to the rest of the world. If things continue as they are, he said, \"within 30 years Nigeria -- just one African country -- will have more inhabitants than the entire European Union, more inhabitants than the United States of America.\" Pence spoke at a pivotal time for abortion rights in the U.S. Republican-led state legislatures have enacted increasingly restrictive laws and the Supreme Courts conservative majority recently allowed a Texas law banning most abortions to go into effect. The court is due next to consider a Mississippi ban on most abortions after 15 weeks. Anti-abortion activists hope that the court will use that case to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling which ensured a woman\\'s constitutional right to an abortion. ------ Gera reported from Warsaw.\\nAmid outrage over images the White House said President Joe Biden found \"horrible,\" the U.S. Border Patrol has temporarily stopped using agents on horseback against Haitian migrants in Del Rio, Texas, Homeland Security officials said Thursday. Shortly afterward, White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the decision to end the horse patrols in what critics said was offensively harsh treatment of the migrants. \"We have taken very specific actions as it relates to the horrific photos that we -- were not going to stand for in this administration,\" she told reporters at her daily press briefing. The agents have been put on administrative leave pending an investigation. Images of Border Patrol agents using their horses for crowd control on the banks of the Rio Grande have incensed Democratic lawmakers, some of whom drew a connection to white supremacy and slavery. \"Haitian lives are Black lives, and if we truly believe that Black lives matter, then we must reverse course,\" Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., said at a news conference Wednesday. Pressley also called on the Biden administration to \"immediately and indefinitely\" stop the removal of Haitian nationals back to Haiti. Democrats and immigrant advocates remain concerned that the administrations rapid removal of migrants from the border has limited their access to humanitarian protections outlined under the law. Homeland Security officials said Thursday the removals would continue. Law enforcement agencies across the country use mounted patrols on a regular basis to traverse rough terrain, including in remote areas of the border that don\\'t have paved roads. While many were disturbed by what appeared to be aggressive behavior by the agents on horseback, Border Patrol agents who spoke to ABC News said their colleagues in the controversial photographs were following procedures. They said it\\'s common practice for agents on horseback to use \"long reins\" to control the horse, apparently leading a photojournalist at the scene in Del Rio to describe them as \"whips\" being used by the agents. Any use of whips, even on horses, would be out of line with agency policy, Border Patrol Agent and Union Vice President Jon Anfinsen told ABC News. \"These agents are highly trained along with their horses and they were doing exactly what they were trained to do,\" Anfinsen said. About 4,000 migrants remain at the camp and the officials estimated that about two-thirds of the entire group that gathered in Del Rio were families.\\nThe House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot issued its first subpoenas Thursday to four former senior Trump administration officials, including former President Donald Trump\\'s longest-serving aide and last chief of staff. The committee is seeking documents and depositions from Dan Scavino -- Trump\\'s caddy-turned-social media guru and senior White House aide -- former chief of staff Mark Meadows, conservative activist Steve Bannon and Kash Patel, who was the chief of staff for the acting defense secretary on Jan. 6. In the letters, the panel said it was seeking information about Trump\\'s actions before, during and after the Capitol riot regarding his campaign to overturn the election results. The committee is demanding records be delivered by Oct. 7, and for all four witnesses to appear for closed-door depositions on Oct. 14 and 15. \"The Select Committee has reason to believe that you have information relevant to understanding the important activities that led to and informed the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., wrote in letters to Bannon and Scavino. The panel\\'s members have vowed to move aggressively to obtain documents and records from witnesses in Trump\\'s orbit, many of whom have a history of stonewalling congressional investigators. \"That is a concern, but we have additional tools that we didn\\'t before, including a Justice Department that may be willing to pursue criminal contempt when people deliberately flout the compulsory process,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told reporters Thursday about the possibility of Trump aides defying congressional investigators. Trump, in a statement, pledged to fight the subpoenas \"on executive privilege and other grounds,\" though not every recipient was a White House or administration official. Meadows, who was Trump\\'s last chief of staff, was close to Trump before, during and after Jan. 6, and was involved in efforts to challenge the election results -- participating in Trump\\'s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger when he repeatedly urged him to reverse the presidential election results. A Meadows aide declined to comment on the subpoena and whether Meadows would cooperate. Patel, a former GOP congressional aide who worked in the Trump National Security Council before joining the Pentagon, was involved in security preparations for the Jan. 6 counting of the electoral vote on Capitol Hill and mobilizing the response to the riot, according to the committee, citing records obtained from the Defense Department. Bannon, who remained an outside adviser to the president after helping to lead his first presidential campaign and a short stint in the White House, was at a meeting at the Willard Hotel where lawmakers were encouraged to challenge the election results, the committee claimed in its letter. He was quoted as saying, \"All hell is going to break loose tomorrow,\" the panel wrote in its letter, citing a Jan. 5 episode of his podcast, \"War Room.\" Scavino, Trump\\'s longest-serving aide and one of his fiercest defenders on social media, was with Trump before and after rioters stormed the Capitol, the committee claimed in its letter, citing reporting from \"Peril,\" the new book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. He also used his Twitter feed to promote the Jan. 6 demonstration in Washington in support of Trump. Some attendees of that event outside the White House later marched on the Capitol and stormed Congress as lawmakers attempted to officially affirm the election results.\\nTalks of bipartisan police reform legislation in Congress are officially over as Republicans and Democrats can\\'t agree on key issues. Democrats, after more than a year of negotiations, made a final offer, but despite \"significant strides,\" said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., there weren\\'t any more concessions to be made. \"I just want to make it clear that this is not an end -- the efforts to create substantive policing reform will continue,\" Booker told reporters at the Capitol. \"It is a disappointment that we are at this moment,\" Booker continued, adding that having participation from nation\\'s largest police union and the International Association of Chiefs of Police shows that \"this is a bigger movement than where we were just a year or two ago.\" Lead Republican negotiator Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said he\\'s concerned about high crime rates in some cities. \"When you\\'re talking about making progress in the bill, and your definition of progress is to make it punitive -- or take more money away from officers if they don\\'t do what you want them to do -- that\\'s defunding the police,\" Scott told ABC News. \"I\\'m not going to be a part of defunding the police.\" More than a year after the start of a racial reckoning in the United States, the movement to address brutality and racism in policing continues to dominate political discourse. George Floyd\\'s death prompts reform The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was introduced in June 2020, very soon after Floyd, a Black man, was killed by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin during an arrest. Floyd was accused of using a fake $20 bill at a local store. Chauvin pinned Floyd on the ground, with his knee on the back of Floyd\\'s neck and upper back until he went unconscious. Videos taken by bystanders sparked a national movement against police brutality and racism, and legislators, including Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, sought to answer calls for justice and end the current system of policing. The Justice in Policing Act aimed to establish a national standard for policing practices, collect better data on police use of force and misconduct, ban the use of tactics such as no-knock warrants, and limit qualified immunity, which protects officers against private civil lawsuits. It passed the House in March on a party-line vote, but the Republican-majority Senate didn\\'t move it forward. The legislation was reintroduced in 2021. Senate Republicans also proposed a reform bill in June 2020, but Democrats blocked it, saying it didn\\'t do enough. The Justice Act proposed using federal dollars to incentivize police departments to ban controversial practices, like the chokehold that killed Floyd, make lynching a federal hate crime, increase training and enforce the use of body cameras. The effectiveness of no-knock warrants also was to be studied. Democrats and Republicans agree on \\'framework\\' In summer 2021, both sides settled on a shared \"framework\" from which to pursue legislation. \"After months of working in good faith, we have reached an agreement on a framework addressing the major issues for bipartisan police reform,\" Scott, Booker and Bass said in a joint statement. \"There is still more work to be done on the final bill, and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to. Over the next few weeks we look forward to continuing our work toward getting a finalized proposal across the finish line.\" Many Republicans said they believed the proposed legislation put law enforcement under attack, while most Democrats held firm in holding accountable officers accused of abusing suspects. Qualified immunity Both sides still agreed to pursue change, but qualified immunity quickly became a sticking point for Republicans, and it ultimately led to the legislation\\'s demise. Qualified immunity protects officers in cases where they\\'ve been individually accused of violating a person\\'s civil rights. Some congressional Republicans said they feared a rise in frivolous lawsuits if qualified immunity were to be eradicated, but officers still would\\'ve had the same constitutional protections, and civil cases still would\\'ve been reviewed by courts before moving forward. Sources told ABC News that Scott would get on board with a proposal if police unions could agree on a plan, but they\\'ve been very reluctant to do so. Two police unions, the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police, were involved in negotiations with legislators. Though they came close to an agreement with Booker, other police unions such as the National Association of Police Organization, spoke out against Booker\\'s proposals because they weren\\'t included in earlier discussions. Now, it\\'s back to square one. Booker said he and Congressional Democrats will find other pathways to achieving extensive police reform , but those pathways likely won\\'t include Republican colleagues. Vice President Kamala Harris, who was in the Senate at the start of these negotiations, denounced Republican efforts to quash reform. \"We learned that Senate Republicans chose to reject even the most modest reforms. Their refusal to act is unconscionable,\" Harris said in a statement. \"Millions of people marched in the streets to see reform and accountability, not further inaction. Moving forward, we are committed to exploring every available action at the executive level to advance the cause of justice in our nation.\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden was disappointed. \"In the coming weeks,\" she said, \"our team will consult with members of Congress, the law enforcement, civil rights communities and victims families to discuss a path forward, including potential executive actions the president can take to ensure we live up to the American ideal of equality and justice under law.\" ABC News Rachel Scott and Ben Gittleson contributed to this report.\\nThe shots will become available for millions more Americans as soon as Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has endorsed an independent advisory panel\\'s recommendation for seniors and other medically vulnerable Americans to get a booster shot of Pfizer\\'s COVID-19 vaccine, six months after their second dose. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, also partially overruled her agency\\'s advisory panel in a notable departure by adding a recommendation for a third dose for people who are considered high risk due to where they work, such as nurses and teachers -- a group which the panel rejected in its recommendation. Some panelists said that without further data, they weren\\'t comfortable with automatically including younger people because of their jobs. In a statement announcing her decision late Thursday, Walensky pointed to the benefit versus risk analysis she had weighed, and data rapidly evolving. \"In a pandemic, even with uncertainty, we must take actions that we anticipate will do the greatest good,\" Walensky said. \"While todays action was an initial step related to booster shots, it will not distract from our most important focus of primary vaccination in the United States and around the world.\" With Walensky\\'s final sign-off, booster shots will now quickly become available for millions more Americans at pharmacies, doctors\\' offices and other sites that offer the Pfizer vaccine as soon as Friday. The CDC\\'s independent advisory panel voted unanimously on Thursday to recommend Pfizer boosters for people aged 65 and older, along with long-term care facility residents and people as young as 18, if they have an underlying medical condition. People younger than 49, however, should only get a third dose if the benefits outweigh the risks, the panel said -- a personal consideration to discuss with their doctor. Walensky\\'s endorsement at least in part buttons up what has become a seething scientific debate after the Biden administration announced \"boosters-for-all\" ahead of any reviews from the regulatory bodies, or their independent groups. While the White House\\'s political appointees had endorsed Biden\\'s timeline, some of their career scientists and advisers vehemently objected to the incomplete data they were being asked to assess. Ahead of Thursday\\'s vote, Walensky addressed the panelists and thanked them for \"leaning in\" to the complex issue at hand and \"trying to put the pieces together.\" \"You\\'re tasked with difficult decisions, weighing the risks and benefits extrapolating from sometimes a wealth and sometimes a paucity of data available,\" Walensky said, but reminded them that despite the complex and contentious debate they share the goal of pulling the nation out of the pandemic. \"We all recognize that the science and data of COVID-19 are moving faster than any data we\\'ve ever seen before. And while I recognize a tremendously heavy lift of the past year, we all know that the pace is unlikely to let up anytime soon,\" she added. \"We will continue this dialogue, you will have more data to review and more recommendations to make and I will be here with you.\" Not every panelist was excited about the idea of boosters, insisting the vaccines still provide remarkable protection and that it was unvaccinated Americans who remained most at risk. \"I feel like we\\'re putting lipstick on hogs. This is not going to solve the pandemic,\" said Dr. Keipp Talbot, a voting panel member and infectious diseases professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. The panel\\'s vote narrowed Wednesday\\'s authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, which did agree to make the shots available to front-line workers. The vote also followed weeks of a contentious back and forth among top health experts over who should get a booster dose and when -- and whether it\\'s still premature to be asking the question. Scientists agreed that while vaccine protection is waning slightly, on the whole, vaccines are still working to dramatically reduce the risk of hospitalization. And many feared endorsing booster doses for most would imply vaccines are no longer working. \"I feel that we\\'re getting too much ahead of ourselves and that we have too much hope on the line with these boosters,\" said voting member Dr. James Loehr of Cayuga Family Medicine in Ithaca, New York. \"Having said that, you shouldn\\'t let the perfect be in the way of the good.\" Panelists initially pushed back on the proposals that American adults, 18 to 64, who are at risk for severe COVID-19 infection due to underlying medical conditions, or due to their occupation and setting receive a Pfizer booster dose. Many members stressed that in order to truly \"move the dial\" on the pandemic, more people need to complete the initial vaccination series. \"I think two and three are fraught with peril,\" said member Dr. Oliver Brooks, chief medical officer of Watts HealthCare Corporation in Los Angeles, California. \"They\\'ll be superfluous and they\\'ll create great inequities and problems within the implementation, so I\\'m really concerned about the data for boosters in general.\" One repeated sticking point for the CDC\\'s panelists during deliberations on Thursday: the still-open question over whether boosting with mixed vaccines might be permitted -- since for those who received the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, there is no third dose protection currently available. The FDA\\'s vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, addressed the CDC\\'s panelists ahead of Thursday\\'s vote and acknowledged their frustrations. \"I think we understand at FDA the relative urgency here of trying to have a solution for anyone who has been vaccinated with any of the authorized or approved vaccines,\" Marks said. \"Unfortunately, we\\'re not in a place right now which I can give you an exact timeline, but I can tell you that we will proceed with all due urgency to try to get there as rapidly as possible.\" ABC News\\' Eric M. Strauss contributed to this report.\\nRICHMOND, Va. -- A major U.S. port was the target last month of suspected nation-state hackers, according to officials. The Port of Houston, a critical piece of infrastructure along the Gulf Coast, issued a statement Thursday saying it had successfully defended against an attempted hack in August and \"no operational data or systems were impacted.\" Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly initially disclosed that the port was the target of an attack at a Senate committee hearing Thursday morning. She said she believed a \"nation-state actor\" was behind the hack, but did not say which one. \"We are working very closely with our interagency partners and the intelligence community to better understand this threat actor so that we can ensure that we are not only able to protect systems, but ultimately to be able to hold these actors accountable,\" she said. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said the hack was \"concerning\" and said the U.S. needed to \"push back against these nation-state actors who continue to probe and to commit these crimes against our public and private sector entities.\" The hack involved ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, a password management program. Easterly\\'s agency, the FBI and the U.S. Coast Guard issued a joint advisory last week warning that the vulnerability in the software \"poses a serious risk\" to critical infrastructure companies, defense contractors and others. Cybersecurity has become a key focus of the Biden administration. A devastating wave of cyberattacks has compromised sensitive government records and at times led to the shutdown of the operations of energy companies, hospitals and schools. The SolarWinds espionage campaign, which the U.S. government said was conducted by Russian hackers, exposed the emails of 80% of the accounts used by the U.S. attorneys offices in New York and affected several other departments. The Associated Press reported in June that suspected Chinese state hackers had recently targeted telecommunications giant Verizon and the countrys largest water agency.\\nOne person was killed and 14 others were hurt in a shooting at a Kroger grocery store in Collierville, Tennessee, near Memphis, authorities said. The suspected shooter is also dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. Authorities identified the suspected gunman Friday as UK Thang, 29, a third-party vendor for Kroger. Collierville Police Department Chief Dale Lane said in a press briefing Friday that a total of 15 people were shot, including 70-year-old Olivia King who died from her wounds, and are in stable condition. Ten of the victims shot were Kroger employees and five were customers, Lane said. As of Monday, four of the victims remain hospitalized, but are in stable condition, according to Collierville Police. Lane confirmed that the suspected shooter was a lone gunman. He had some minor charges in his criminal history. \"I believe misdemeanor arrests but nothing related to violence,\" Lane said. He said that officials served a search warrant at the alleged shooter\\'s home at a local apartment complex Thursday evening, seizing electronics and other evidence, and one additional person was questioned. Police have not released a motive or said what type of gun was involved. On Monday, police released additional details about the gunman. They said in a statement that he moved to Collierville in the summer of 2020 and on Thursday morning was asked to leave his job. Authorities are investigating the shooting as a possible workplace violence incident, ABC News has learned. Kroger company officials did not immediately respond to ABC News\\' questions about the suspected shooter\\'s employment status. On Thursday police had said at least 14 patients have visited local hospitals and there were \"very serious\" injuries. Five of those patients were in critical condition, and one has been discharged, hospital staff confirmed to ABC News Thursday evening. One victim was not shot but suffered from an anxiety attack, police said. King\\'s family identified her as the victim killed and they believed she had gone to church for daily mass Thursday morning before shopping at the store. \"Our family is devastated by this senseless act of violence. We ask that you pray for the repose of the soul of our mother, Olivia,\" one of her sons, Wes King, told ABC News. \"We also ask everyone for their prayers for all families and friends affected by the events today, as well as for God\\'s mercy on the shooter and his family. Thank you.\" All 44 employees at the store at the time of the shooting have been accounted for, Chief Dale Lane said at a press briefing Thursday evening, noting that the crime scene was \"significant.\" Some hid in freezers and locked offices when the gunfire broke out at about 1:30 p.m. local time, police said. One employee fled to the roof and was escorted to safety by police. Brignetta Dickerson, a cashier, told Memphis ABC affiliate WATN that she ran into a back room with customers. The cashier said the gunman came in shooting, striking an employee in the head, a customer in the stomach and an employee in the cheek. She said the gunman then left and continued to open fire. \"All of a sudden, I went through the receiving department ... and here he comes right behind us and start shooting and he kept shooting and shooting and shooting,\" she told WATN. Tawana French said she was heading into the Kroger Thursday afternoon when she encountered people, including children, running out of the store. \"A split second later, I hear gunfire,\" French told Linsey Davis in an interview on ABC News Live Prime Thursday night. \"I ran, ran, ran. Before I could get to my car, which was not very far at all, I heard even more gunfire. Rapid succession, just pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.\" \"I just wanted to get to a safe place,\" said French, who immediately got in her car and drove away. Employee Jean Prost said she was working in the produce section at the back of the store when she heard five loud pops that she initially thought were the sound of a co-worker popping balloons. \"I thought, \\'Gosh, she\\'s busting a lot of balloons.\\' And I looked up and I see people running, and I thought, \\'Oh -- something is happening, or they wouldn\\'t be running,\\'\" said Prost. Prost darted out a side door and hustled around the back of the building with a customer, finding a \"little brick corner\" in which to hide. The gunshots were so loud that she was sure the shooter was firing his weapon outside, she said. \"I\\'m thinking, \\'There\\'s nowhere to hide.\\' You\\'re just out in the open and you\\'re at his mercy and he could just shoot you,\" said Prost. \"I was so scared I couldn\\'t even run.\" Sara Wiles, an intensive care unit nurse, was shopping at the grocery store when shots fired. \"Just walked in on a Thursday to buy a potato, an onion to make soup for dinner and was in the back and I heard the initial pop of the gun, but at that time I thought it was one of the Mylar balloons,\" she said on \"Good Morning America\" Friday. When she heard more shots she started running to the meat department. A Kroger employee directed her and two others to the back hallway by the stockrooms. \"We made ourselves a hiding space and we hid in that area until we could hear things start to settle down,\" Wiles recalled. Eventually police officers walked by and led them to the back section of the store where other shooting victims were waiting. That\\'s when her nurse instincts kicked in. \"I just turned and looked at the paramedics and said I\\'m a nurse, what do I do? What do you need me to do? And just went around and checked on people, asked them how they were doing and made sure that people were conscious,\" Wiles said. \"Everybody says when they\\'ve seen this scenario that it never happens in my community. I can tell you that\\'s true living here for 33 years,\" she said praising first responders for their speedy response. \"It could have been a whole lot worse had it been a weekend.\" The suspected shooter\\'s car remains in the store parking lot, police said. Resources were brought in to safely inspect the vehicle. Police plan to carry out search warrants at several locations, but Lane couldn\\'t divulge any information on where. There are no additional threats at this time, he said. \"This situation is going to drive fear, but we are a resilient community,\" Lane said. Collierville is about 30 miles from Memphis. Memphis police said its officers are helping secure the scene. The FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also on the scene. A Kroger spokesperson said in a statement, \"The entire Kroger family offers our thoughts, prayers and support to the individuals and families of the victims during this difficult time.\" \"We are cooperating with local law enforcement, who have secured the store and parking lot. The store will remain closed while the police investigation continues, and we have initiated counseling services for our associates,\" the statement continued.

Both theme parks honor this festive Mexican tradition that celebrates the everlasting bonds of family and our loved ones who have been - and will forever be - part of our lives. In Disney California Adventure park, Plaza de la Familia is an immersive homage to the celebration. Here you will enjoy live entertainment with storytelling, folklorico dancers, Mariachi musicians, and delicious Mexican fare. The experience begins as you walk through the marigold arch which draws its inspiration from the bridge that connects the Land of the Living to the Land of the Dead in Disney and Pixars \"Coco.\" Not to be missed is \"A Musical Celebration of Coco\" presented several times a day. This spirited show brings to life the story, songs and themes that are at the heart of the beloved film. Led by the charming singer/storyteller Mateo, his troupe of singers, dancers and musicians recount the adventures of young Miguel on his journey to the fantastical Land of the Dead. Paradise Garden Grill serves up flavors of authentic Mexican cuisine, including favorites like the Traditional Tamale Plate and Tortitas de Papa. While enjoying your meal, enjoy the musical accompaniments of Mariachi Espectacular and Mariachi Divas at Paradise Gardens colorful bandstand. Also in Plaza de la Familia, youll see the colorful \"Arbol de la Vida\" or Tree of Life, a Mexican icon which is a perfect backdrop for your photos. The Tree of Life is decorated with images, colors and symbols. Its branches hold flowers, animals and evocative \"calacas\" or skeletons - all connected to each other through the theme of family. Make a stop at the Memory Wall to leave a written remembrance of your loved ones. Nearby, another photo moment awaits, when you pose with Miguel, who appears in the form of a hand-carved dimensional figure inspired by Mexican folk art. Miguel and his performer appear before a beautiful artistic mural entitled, \"Recuerdame\" (\"Remember Me\"). You can also design your own paper \"alebrije\" (spirit guide) mask of Pepita or Dante as part of a craft activity. Alebrijes are small figurines of fantastical creatures, which feature a whimsical mix of the physical elements of many different animals. And dont forget to cruise over to Cars Land, where youll find a tribute to Dia de los Muertos at Ramones House of Body Art. In Disneyland park, be sure to visit the traditional Dia de los Muertos display at El Zocalo Park in Frontierland. This colorful display features marigolds and banners of papel picado, along with two traditional \"ofrendas,\" sugar skulls known as \"cavaleras\" and an iconic figure of La Catrina.

Be sure to try a Creamy Horchata, sweet creamy cinnamon rice and milk beverage served over ice! Dont wait! Make plans to enjoy all the Dia de los Muertos happenings at the Disneyland Resort now through Nov. 2!\\nDebuting Sept. 28th from Disney Editions is a brand-new coffee table book, \"A Portrait of Walt Disney World: 50 Years of The Most Magical Place on Earth.\" I recently sat down with my fellow authors Kevin Kern and Steven Vagnini to share more about the creative process behind crafting this impressive 320-page Walt Disney World salute, released just in time for the start of the 18-month Walt Disney World resort 50th anniversary celebration. What was the goal of the book? KEVIN: Our goal was to create a historical snapshot using as many voices as possible. Were especially delighted to feature essays from the likes of Debby Dane Browne (the first Walt Disney World Ambassador), Dick Nunis (Disney Legend and former head of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts), and Roy Patrick Disney (grandson of Roy O. Disney, co-founder of The Walt Disney Company). Each add a rich sense of placemaking detail to what it was like during the development and opening of Walt Disney World. TIM: We wanted to create a book that will delight readers with rarely seen visuals and new information and generate a sense of awe and wonder. We also wanted to re-affirm what many people already believe--that Walt Disney World is a revered and respected destination on the pop culture landscape with an incredible ongoing legacy. STEVEN: The goal was consistent: to pay tribute to this remarkable place and the thousands of cast members, Imagineers, and guests who have made Walt Disney World a reality over five decades. Im especially excited that we could spotlight the voices of many unsung leaders who helped plan and organize the \"Florida Project\" in its earliest years; many of them have windows on Main Street, U.S.A., but their stories are not as widely known! Tell us about your first visit to Walt Disney World. KEVIN: It was April 1990. The Great Movie Ride had a profound impact on me, as did The Magic of Disney Animation tour at Disneys Hollywood Studios. Growing up about as far away from Hollywood as one can, the magic of the movies, and the magic of Disney really, just grabbed my senses and interests like nothing else. Young Kevin palling around with Donald Duck at Disneys Hollywood Studios, 1990. TIM: My first visit was in 1983. EPCOT was less than a year old and Ill never forget the sense of wonder and optimism as represented by this new kind of Disney experience. During one particular evening, EPCOT had officially ended its day and we discovered we were among a few straggling diners left in the park, seemingly having EPCOT all to ourselves. Ground-based audio speakers were new back then and to walk towards, and under, the glowing imposing structure of Spaceship Earth, with the magnificent and inspiring music of EPCOT surrounding us, remains an indelible memory for me. STEVEN: As a Central Florida native, I first visited as a one-year-old. Apparently, I had \"the best time of my life!\" Its hard to remember the details of that first experience, but my earliest memories include feeling the sensation of flight in the If You Could Fly attractionin Tomorrowland and enjoying all the down-home hootin and hollerin of the Melvin the Moose Breakfast Show at Fort Wilderness. Young Steven and his brother, Michael, confer with Stevens future boss aboard the Empress Lilly Character Breakfast in Walt Disney World Village, c. 1990. What would you say was the most important or transformative memory you have on the property? KEVIN: The very first Disney book I ever purchased on my own was Jeff Kurttis \"Since the World Began\" (Disney Editions, 1996). I bought my copy at the end of a family visit and vividly remember sitting on the back porch of the Meadow Trading Post at Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground pouring over the pages - I couldnt get enough. I was blown away by the history within those covers. The tome ignited a hope that one day Id have the chance to work on a book about Walt Disney World. I suppose theres a bit of poetic justice that here 25 years later, Id be on the very team tasked to help make that dream a reality. TIM: Mine are \"pinch-me-I cant believe-this-is-happening\" moments: one evening sitting in the rocking chairs on the back porch of Disneys BoardWalk with songwriter Richard M. Sherman (and his lovely wife, Elizabeth), Oscar-winner Hayley Mills, and Disney author Jeff Kurtti, and all of us joining in song on an impromptu rendition of \"On the Front Porch\" (yeah, corny, I know!). There was also the 25th anniversary ceremony at Cinderella Castle officiated by Roy E. Disney and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. I was with Disney Legends Marc and Alice Davis and could see the pride in their eyes knowing their contributions to the resort would last for generations. Plus, collaborating with Steven in 2011 to reunite Figment, Dreamfinder, and songwriter Richard Sherman to the immense delight of D23 Members. There are so many special memories like these that I count myself incredibly lucky. STEVEN: Meeting my incredible wife at the resort as cast members and eventually having a Disney Fairy Tale Wedding. Second was producing, with Tim, the programming for D23s 2011 Destination D event, celebrating 40 years of Walt Disney World. Throughout that weekend, fans of all ages came together to celebrate the stories and Disney Legends behind this remarkable place. I think all of us -on and off stage - felt something pretty magical that weekend ... a special sense of community bonded by a deep-rooted love for our shared Walt Disney World experiences. That certainly inspired me to want to spotlight those inspiring voices and incredible stories in our book. Based on your favorite aspects of the resort, which sections of the book were you most excited to write? KEVIN: When the three of us sat down to chat an apt metaphor presented itself - a \"thematic compass.\" By focusing in on the resort through various conceptual lenses - nostalgia, fantasy, discovery, and tomorrow - we were able to tie concept art, photography, and ephemera from across the five decades together in ways that hopefully will surprise and delight readers. STEVEN: Since becoming an Imagineer, Ive developed an even greater appreciation for Disneys Animal Kingdom, which is layered with such brilliant nuances. I think the way we tell stories in this park deserves closer inspection and understanding, and hopefully, readers of our book will appreciate our scene-by-scene journey through the theme park with the diverse voices of those who helped design and build it! TIM: Each of us took ownership of writing certain chapters and sections of the book then we cross-checked and edited each other resulting in one of the most wonderfully collaborative efforts Ive ever experienced. So, there is a little bit of each of us in almost every paragraph no matter who was responsible for a section or chapter. What is your favorite section of the book? KEVIN: The special essays are a delight to read and left each of us in awe after our conversations with Debby, Dick, and Roy Patrick. We also feature a section called \"Reflections,\" where we hear from voices across popular culture and Disney history about Walt Disney World as a cultural site while also reminiscing about past resort anniversary celebrations. That might surprise a few readers. On a bright fall morning in Magic Kingdom Park, Steven, late Walt Disney Archives founder and Disney Legend Dave Smith, and inaugural Walt Disney World Ambassador Debby Dane Browne share memories of The Most Magical Place on Earth. Dave and Debby are featured in A Portrait of Walt Disney World and provided profound contributions and inspiration for the book. TIM: I love all of it! We really wanted to create the most comprehensive book yet written on Walt Disney World and I believe weve done that. I also love our 15-pages of endnotes. They demonstrate our extensive research and gives the book solid credibility. I bow to Kevins insistence and am proud that our book features such detail. STEVEN: One of the most fun sections to write was our chapter on the Disney familys roots in Florida - something that Walt Disney Archives founder Dave Smith began researching in 1970. I think few people realize that some 80 years before Walt Disney had his sights on Central Florida, his parents and grandparents actually settled here, planting familial roots near a (now long lost) town called Kismet, 60 miles due north of the future Disney property. As we look forward to \"The Worlds Most Magical Celebration,\" what excites you most about the Walt Disney World 50th Anniversary? KEVIN: Just having the chance to share and reflect with everyone about how remarkable the resort is in execution. Walts hope for the site to serve as a gathering place to find joy, inspiration, and new knowledge about the worlds around us is just as prescient today as ever before. TIM: I been involved in so many Walt Disney World campaigns, from the 20th anniversary now up to the 50th anniversary. All have one thing in common. Everyone wants to be a part of something special. I look forward to celebrating a truly remarkable story with everyone, a half-century in the making, that guests, cast members, and Imagineers alike helped write. STEVEN: Gathering together to celebrate 50 years of Walt Disneys last, and arguably grandest, dream could be nothing short of \"The Worlds Most Magical Celebration!\" To me, the cast and Imagineers of Walt Disney World are the very definition of \"magic makers.\" I cant wait to see them in action, creating magic for our guests, amid all the new entertainment and excitement of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration! \"A Portrait of Walt Disney World: 50 Years of The Most Magical Place\" on Earth will be available at Walt Disney World, shopDisney, and wherever books are sold beginning on September 28th.

While they work in different departments, they have one very important thing in common: they both can communicate through American Sign Language. David and Jr. first met in 2020 when David noticed Jr. signing along to the music playing in Downtown Disney. David, who is deaf, was impressed with Jr.s signing and ability and the two have been connecting and learning from one another ever since. \"I always will make a friend with any cast member who is motivated to learn sign language with me,\" David shared. Jr. learned American Sign Language in high school and has been able to use his skills to interact with guests who use ASL and of course, to catch up with his friend David. \"[Knowing American Sign Language] gives me the opportunity to connect with people within the community I may not have otherwise,\" Jr. said. \"Its never too late to learn how to sign!\" See these two in action as we celebrate International Day of Sign Languages and meet more of our cast members on TikTok @DisneyParks!\\nAs we continue to celebrate Hispanic Latinx Heritage Month, honoring the communities cultures and contributions to the United States, we are thrilled to share the stories of a few of the talented cast members behind your favorite products, books and games. Keep reading for some inspiration you wont want to miss! At Disney Consumer Products, Games and Publishing, we are dedicated to developing unique, compelling products that reflect the diversity of fans and families around the world. Our commitment to inclusion is driven by the incredible diversity of Disneys talented employees and cast members, who are responsible for creating authentic and unforgettable products and experiences that capture the imaginations of generations of people everywhere. Rocio Cintron, Product Design Manager for Disney Preschool, shared how she infuses her background into the work she does, which allows her to learn and celebrate other cultures as well. \"I support and consult on projects that celebrate the unique cultures of Latin America. Most recently, I had the opportunity to consult on toys inspired by the upcoming Walt Disney Animation Studios film, \"Encanto.\" I also love celebrating other cultures. I worked on \"Mira, Royal Detective\" toys, which highlight the vibrancy of Indian culture, which was special because it reminded me a lot of my Puerto Rican culture - both are colorful, musical and have yummy food! We all really have more similarities than differences.\" Rocio said. No doubt about it, Rocio; food is the universal language, after all! Speaking of yummy food, Rocios favorite Disney treat at the Parks is a churro, a traditional Mexican dessert. Rocio also shared that her favorite ride at Disneyland is Mad Tea Party because the teacups are \"colorful and sweet,\" and she has had the opportunity to work on \"Alices Wonderland Bakery\" toys. In describing her favorite Disney character, Rocio explained that she is drawn to Ariels passion and dedication as well as the fact that she lives in two different worlds, stating, \"I [also] celebrate two places and two cultures at once - being Latinx, but also being American.\" Sidney Leon, Allocator for Global Product Creation, is committed to advocating for inclusivity and collaboration to ensure that meaningful and impactful stories that resonate with guests are brought to life through her work. \"Coming from a Mexican background, I am passionate, opinionated, driven and detail-oriented, and I feel that I carry these traits into my work. I try to assure that others have what they need and feel comfortable to speak up and share their opinions. I also am part of a larger team working to ensure fans and families around the world feel represented by our products and experiences,\" Sidney said. What is Sidneys favorite attraction at Disneyland? \"I love Space Mountain. I have a deep fascination for the universe and learning about its origins,\" she said. Space is a mysterious place, and Sidney said that attractions like Space Mountain show her that through the ever-changing universe, we all play a part in the direction of our own world. \"The magic starts from within, by sharing our opinion and talking about our backgrounds.\" Sidney said. She expressed that in order to learn more about the universe, we must first learn more about each other. Mariana Vaca, Assistant Manager on the Communications team, shared her pride for working on inclusive and representative products and experiences. \"When people enjoy a product, theyre choosing a physical item that represents who they are. It is a privilege to work on the Consumer Products, Games and Publishing team and be part of the fans journey as they find merchandise, books, games, and more that makes them feel seen and allows them to express who they are.\" Mariana also said she has found collaborating with other cast members to be incredibly impactful. \"Ive been able to connect with a number of people at Disney with shared experiences like having immigrant parents, growing up in a non-English-speaking household, and other moments that many multicultural folks can relate to,\" she said. Additionally, Mariana enjoys sharing the magic of Disney with relatives. \"Going to Disneyland with my family has always felt special. Im the oldest of my cousins, and the only one who doesnt live in Mexico, so Ive been lucky enough to join many first-time Disney trips,\" she said. Isaac Ramos, who manages products across connected consumer platforms, prides himself on being what he refers to as, \"first-generation corporate.\" He feels it is important to remain authentic and true to who he is in the workplace and foster a community. Isaac integrates his own Mexican culture into his work through his approach to leadership. \"I think Im good at leading a team because a part of my culture is leading a family, so I get to weave that into my role,\" he explained.

Republican Speaker Spencer Gosch said Saturday that there is enough support in the state House to discuss impeachment. The state Senate had already gathered enough signatures to do so. The impeachment discussions will take place when lawmakers are in Pierre for a special session that starts Nov. 9 to address the redrawing of the state\\'s 10-year electoral maps. The move does not necessarily mean Ravnsborg, a Republican, will face impeachment proceedings, Gosch said. Once in session, lawmakers will have to decide on whether to consider a separate resolution to form a select committee to review evidence from the Sept. 12, 2020, crash, the Argus Leader reported. Ravnsborg pleaded no contest to a pair of traffic misdemeanors for the crash that killed Joseph Boever, who was walking on the shoulder of a rural highway late at night. Ravnsborg was driving home from a Republican fundraiser, and he didn\\'t return to the crash scene until the next day, telling investigators he though he had struck a deer. Ravnsborg avoided jail time and was sentenced to fines totaling over $4,500 for making an illegal lane change and using a cellphone while driving. Republican Gov. Kristi Noem has repeatedly called on Ravnsborg to resign. He has insisted that he will not, though, and that he can perform the duties of his office. Leaders of the Republican-led Legislature decided that the names of the lawmakers who signed the petitions would not be made public.\\nAn Ohio man is among those who made their way to the Texas border city of Del Rio, where thousands of Haitian migrants set up camp near a border bridge, including many seeking asylum DEL RIO, Texas -- As Haitian migrants stepped off a white U.S. Border Patrol van in the Texas border city of Del Rio after learning they\\'d be allowed to stay in the country for now, a man in a neon yellow vest stood nearby and quietly surveyed them. Some carried sleeping babies, and one toddler walked behind her mother wrapped in a silver heat blanket. As they passed by to be processed by a local nonprofit that provides migrants with basic essentials and helps them reach family in the U.S., many smiled -- happy to be starting a new leg of their journey after a chaotic spell in a crowded camp near a border bridge that links Del Rio with Ciudad Acuna, Mexico. Dave, who didnt want to share his last name because he feared a backlash for trying to help people who entered the U.S. illegally, didnt see his friend Ruth in this group. But he wore the bright safety vest so she would be able to spot him in the crowd when she arrived with her husband and 3-year-old daughter. \"I feel like my friend is worth my time to come down and help,\" he told The Associated Press on Friday. On Tuesday, Dave set out from his hometown of Toledo, Ohio, and made the nearly 1,300-mile (2,092-kilometer) drive to Del Rio, where up to 15,000 migrants suddenly crossed in from Mexico this month, most of them Haitian and many seeking asylum. The 64-year-old met Ruth over a decade ago during a Christian mission to Haiti. Over the years, Dave would send Ruth money for a little girl he met in an orphanage whom he\\'d promised himself he\\'d support. Ruth always made sure the girl had what she needed. Last month, Ruth and her family left South America, where they briefly lived after leaving their impoverished Caribbean homeland, to try to make it to the United States. Dave told her hed be there when they arrived to drive them to her sisters house in Ohio. \"I just see it as an opportunity to serve somebody,\" he said. \"We have so much.\" The nonprofit, the Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition, has received dozens of drop-offs from U.S. Border Patrol agents since the sudden influx of migrants to Del Rio became the country\\'s most pressing immigration challenge. Its operations director, Tiffany Burrow, said the group processed more than 1,600 Haitian migrants from Monday through when the camp was completely cleared Friday, assisting them with travel and resettlement necessities. This is nothing new for Burrow, who has watched Haitian migrants cross into Del Rio in smaller numbers since January. But this recent wave overwhelmed her small group. \"Its a different volume. And the eyes of the world are on us this time,\" Burrow told the AP. As Dave waited Friday for the next bus to arrive, he shimmied a child seat into place in the back seat of his vehicle. It was for Ruth\\'s toddler and was the first thing he spotted when he stopped at a thrift store on his way out of Toledo. He viewed it as a little sign he was doing the right thing. Ruth and her family had spent the past week at the bridge camp and Dave had been communicating with her through WhatsApp. But all communication stopped Thursday around noon, and he said Ruth\\'s sister in Ohio also hadn\\'t heard from her. Still, Dave waited, scrolling through a list of \"what ifs.\" He wondered aloud if her phone died or if she was in a Border Patrol facility with strict rules about electronic devices. \"Im putting a lot of faith in my phone,\" he said, laughing. Like Dave, Dr. Pierre Moreau made the trip to Del Rio from Miami to help. A Haitian immigrant himself and U.S. Navy veteran, he saw the images unfolding from the camp and booked a flight. \"That was devastating. My heart was crying,\" Moreau said. \"And I told my wife Im coming. And she said go.\" Moreau didn\\'t have a plan -- just a rental car full of toiletries and supplies he hoped to pass out to any migrants he came across. \"Im concerned about my brothers and sisters. And I was concerned with the way they were treated,\" he said. Dave said he hates how politicized the border issue has become. He considers himself a supporter of former President Donald Trump but said hes more complicated than a single label. As he waited in his car, Dave gushed over how hard Ruth had worked as a nurse to get to the United States -- a dream shes held for over a decade. He said he knows she\\'ll do the same in the U.S. and that all hes doing is giving her and her small family a leg up. \"I help them with their first step,\" Dave said. \"And like a little child, next time you see them, theyll be running.\" Every time a Border Patrol bus or van pulled up to the coalition, Dave and his yellow vest would cross the street. He waited as each migrant climbed out, hoping to see Ruth, and he even darted over to one woman thinking it was her. \"That sounded just like Ruth\\'s voice,\" he said. As news broke Friday that the camp had been cleared, Dave still held out hope that she\\'d arrive. But 10 hours after he pulled up, the coalition announced it had received its last busload and that no more migrants would be arriving from the camp. This wave, at least for now, was over for Del Rio. But Burrow said there will likely be others. \"Right now, were in a cycle,\" she said. \"We\\'re learning to work with it.\" Dave stood up from his folding chair and started walking back to his car. He still hadn\\'t heard anything from Ruth and he again speculated as to where she and her family might be, including that they could have been sent on a deportation flight back to Haiti. He looked defeated but said he didn\\'t plan to drive back to Ohio until he heard from Ruth -- not until he knew his friend was OK. \"I cringe when I hear the beep that its going to be the wrong message,\" Dave said. \"But I try to keep hoping. I dont know what else I can do.\" ------ Follow Morgan on Twitter: https://twitter.com/StorytellerSBM\\nA former senior Department of Homeland Security official who once accused the Trump administration of politicizing intelligence said Sunday that a return of President Donald Trump to the White House in 2024 \"would be a disaster\" for the U.S. intelligence community. \"(Former President Trump) has denigrated the intelligence community, he puts out disinformation -- and that\\'s an existential threat to democracy and he is one of the best at putting it out and hurting this country,\" Brian Murphy, who once led the DHS intelligence branch, said Sunday in an exclusive interview on ABC\\'s \"This Week\" with George Stephanopoulos. Murphy, a long-time federal law enforcement official, made headlines last year after filing a whistleblower complaint accusing Trump-appointed leaders of politicizing intelligence by withholding or downplaying threats that ran counter to Trump\\'s political messages. The 24-page complaint, filed in September 2020, named former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and former acting Secretary Chad Wolf as trying to \"censor or manipulate\" intelligence bulletins related to Russian meddling in the presidential election and the threat of domestic white supremacist groups. \"I became a whistleblower because when I arrived at DHS in 2018, from the outset, everything that I had stood for -- you know, finding objective truth when I was in the FBI and serving in the Marines and serving the American public -- was quickly told to me that\\'s no longer acceptable,\" Murphy said Sunday. In his complaint, Murphy further accused Nielsen, Wolf and other top officials of scrambling to gather and prepare intelligence reports that aligned with Trump\\'s public remarks in the months leading up to the 2020 election. \"There was intense pressure to try to take intelligence and fit a political narrative,\" Murphy said Sunday. \"When I got to DHS, it was all about politics.\" In one instance, Murphy wrote in his complaint that he was \"instructed\" by Wolf \"to cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the United States, and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran.\" On Sunday, Murphy said \"there was a push-on across government at the senior levels -- cabinet officials -- to do everything possible to stifle anything\" about Russia\\'s interference. \"They did not want the American public to know that the Russians were supporting Trump and denigrating what would soon be President Biden,\" Murphy added. Murphy also claimed Sunday that discussing white supremacy as a national security threat became a \"third-rail issue\" within the department after the 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. \"I disagreed with that, I made that known to my superiors,\" Murphy said Sunday. A DHS spokesperson said last year that the agency \"flatly denies that there is any truth to the merits of Mr. Murphy\\'s claim.\" Wolf responded last September during a speech that any effort to \"paint recent DHS actions as examples of mission drift or politicization ... could not be more wrong.\" James Wareham, Nielsen\\'s attorney, told ABC News at the time that Murphy\\'s allegations \"would be laughable if they were not so defamatory.\" Murphy\\'s explosive claims nonetheless fueled concerns that Trump and his appointees had sought to politicize the intelligence process to more closely support the administration\\'s legislative and political agenda. Shortly before filing his whistleblower complaint, Murphy was reassigned within the department after it was revealed that his intelligence unit had included reporters\\' tweets in bulletins disseminated to law enforcement networks across the U.S. -- a practice that experts said was out of the agency\\'s purview. Questioned by Stephanopoulos about that, Murphy said Sunday he \"understands why, at the time, the media reacted the way they did\" to reports his branch collated public-source information about reporters, citing the alleged credibility gap between the White House and the American people. Murphy added that \"at no time was I aware or direct anybody in my organization to collect information on journalists.\" \"People did not trust (the Trump administration). There was a war against the media and I wasn\\'t going to be a part of that,\" Murphy said. Murphy\\'s last day at DHS was Friday.\\nRemoval of an app has sparked fears the companies will accept more censorship. MOSCOW -- Russia\\'s best-known opposition figure, Alexey Navalny, has criticized Google and Apple for bending to Kremlin demands for censorship during recent parliamentary elections, accusing the tech giants of \"cowardice\" and of becoming \"accomplices\" to president Vladimir Putin\\'s efforts to suppress political opposition. Both companies bowed to Russian government pressure to delete content relating to a tactical voting campaign promoted by Navalny during elections last weekend that saw Russia\\'s ruling pro-Putin party retain its majority amid accusations of widespread ballot-rigging and a crackdown on anti-Kremlin opposition. \"If something surprised me in the latest elections, it was not how Putin forged the results, but how obediently the almighty Big Tech turned into his accomplices,\" Navalny said on Twitter on Thursday -- a message written from prison and published by colleagues. To be honest, things look really, really dark right now. Navalny\\'s campaign, named Smart Voting, had called for people to vote for any candidate with the best chance of defeating the ruling party, United Russia. The online content had contained lists of registered candidates recommended by Navalny\\'s team. Google and Apple removed Smart Voting apps from their stores in Russia, and Google blocked two related videos on YouTube. The removals are the biggest concession the tech firms have made to Kremlin demands to restrict content and it has set off fears among liberal Russians that it is a significant step towards the companies accepting broader censorship in the country. Russian authorities outlawed Navalny\\'s movement earlier this year, after jailing the anti-corruption activist and pro-democracy campaigner who survived a nerve-agent poisoning in 2020. The government in June designated Navalny\\'s Anti-Corruption Foundation and its regional political offices as \"extremist organizations,\" equating them to violent terrorist groups and requiring social media platforms to ban their content. The designation has been widely condemned internationally, including by the United States, as politically motivated. Neither Google nor Apple have made a public statement on the app removals, and each declined to comment to ABC News. In an email explaining the decision to the Anti-Corruption Foundation, published online by Navalny\\'s team, Apple said it was obliged to follow local laws and cited Russian prosecutors\\' allegations that the app enabled \"election interference.\" Navalny accused the companies of allowing themselves to be used as instruments of the Kremlin to block legitimate efforts at peaceful opposition, saying they were worried about losing market access to Russia and calling them \"hypocrites\" for presenting themselves as firms driven by values such as improving the world. Google famously used \"Don\\'t be evil\" as a company motto. \"In our case, the very intention to organize voters in order to put competitive pressure on the ruling party was declared criminal, and Big Tech agreed with this,\" Navalny wrote. He also called on employees inside the companies to raise the issue, writing: \"I know that most of those who work at Google, Apple, etc. are honest and good people. I urge them not to put up with the cowardice of their bosses.\" Google and Apple in the past largely have resisted Russian government demands that they remove content that criticizes authorities, racking up fines imposed by Russia\\'s state censor. But recently the Kremlin has escalated pressure on U.S. tech companies amid a broader crackdown on dissent. The day before Apple and Google each removed the voting app, the companies were made to appear before a committee of Russia\\'s senate. Andrey Klimov, a prominent senator who heads a commission -- Protection of State Sovereignty and Prevention of Interference in the country\\'s Internal Affairs -- accused them of illegal election interference and threatened to penalize them with new legislation. Days before that, court bailiffs visited Google\\'s offices in Moscow, demanding the company pay unpaid fines imposed by the state censor. The New York Times reported Google made the decision to remove Navalny\\'s app after authorities threatened to arrest local employees at Google\\'s Moscow office. Security experts have said they\\'re concerned the Kremlin is now increasingly bent on taming foreign tech giants as it tightens its grip on the Russian internet. The government has blocked a growing number of sites and is developing infrastructure to allow it to cut off Russia\\'s acces to the global web, if deemed necessary. This year it began slowing down Twitter after the company refused to remove content. Andrey Soldatov, author of \"Red Web,\" which examines the Russian government\\'s efforts to control the internet, said last week\\'s concession was unlikely to discourage the Kremlin from leaning on Google and Apple further. He said the government was increasingly confident in its technical capabilities to block major international platforms. \"To be honest,\" he told ABC News by phone, \"things look really, really dark right now.\"\\nThe Battle of the Nibelungs -- a reference to a classic heroic epic much loved by the Nazis -- is one of dozens of far-right groups that continue to leverage mainstream social media for profit, despite Facebooks and other platforms repeated pledges to purge themselves of extremism. All told, there are at least 54 Facebook profiles belonging to 39 entities that the German government and civil society groups have flagged as extremist, according to research shared with The Associated Press by the Counter Extremism Project, a non-profit policy and advocacy group formed to combat extremism. The groups have nearly 268,000 subscribers and friends on Facebook alone. CEP also found 39 related Instagram profiles, 16 Twitter profiles and 34 YouTube channels, which have gotten over 9.5 million views. Nearly 60% of the profiles were explicitly aimed at making money, displaying prominent links to online shops or photos promoting merchandise. Click on the big blue \"view shop\" button on the Erik & Sons Facebook page and you can buy a T-shirt that says, \"My favorite color is white,\" for 20 euros ($23). Deutsches Warenhaus offers \"Refugees not welcome\" stickers for just 2.50 euros ($3) and Aryan Brotherhood tube scarves with skull faces for 5.88 euros ($7). The Facebook feed of OPOS Records promotes new music and merchandise, including \"True Aggression,\" \"Pride & Dignity,\" and \"One Family\" T-shirts. The brand, which stands for \"One People One Struggle,\" also links to its online shop from Twitter and Instagram. ---- EDITORS NOTE: This story is part of a collaboration between The Associated Press and the PBS series FRONTLINE that examines challenges to the ideas and institutions of traditional U.S. and European democracy. --- The people and organizations in CEP\\'s dataset are a whos who of Germanys far-right music and combat sports scenes. \"They are the ones who build the infrastructure where people meet, make money, enjoy music and recruit,\" said Alexander Ritzmann, the lead researcher on the project. \"Its most likely not the guys Ive highlighted who will commit violent crimes. Theyre too smart. They build the narratives and foster the activities of this milieu where violence then appears.\" CEP said it focused on groups that want to overthrow liberal democratic institutions and norms such as freedom of the press, protection of minorities and universal human dignity, and believe that the white race is under siege and needs to be preserved, with violence if necessary. None has been banned, but almost all have been described in German intelligence reports as extremist, CEP said. On Facebook the groups seem harmless. They avoid blatant violations of platform rules, such as using hate speech or posting swastikas, which is generally illegal in Germany. By carefully toeing the line of propriety, these key architects of Germanys far-right use the power of mainstream social media to promote festivals, fashion brands, music labels and mixed martial arts tournaments that can generate millions in sales and connect like-minded thinkers from around the world. But simply cutting off such groups could have unintended, damaging consequences. \"We dont want to head down a path where we are telling sites they should remove people based on who they are but not what they do on the site,\" said David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco. Giving platforms wide latitude to sanction organizations deemed undesirable could give repressive governments leverage to eliminate their critics. \"That can have really serious human rights concerns,\" he said. \"The history of content moderation has shown us that its almost always to the disadvantage of marginalized and powerless people.\" German authorities banned the Battle of the Nibelungs event in 2019, on the grounds that it was not actually about sports, but instead was grooming fighters with combat skills for political struggle. In 2020, as the coronavirus raged, organizers planned to stream the event online -- using Instagram, among other places, to promote the webcast. A few weeks before the planned event, however, over a hundred black-clad police in balaclavas broke up a gathering at a motorcycle club in Magdeburg, where fights were being filmed for the broadcast, and hauled off the boxing ring, according to local media reports. The Battle of the Nibelungs is a \"central point of contact\" for right-wing extremists, according to German government intelligence reports. The organization has been explicit about its political goals -- namely to fight against the \"rotting\" liberal democratic order -- and has drawn adherents from across Europe as well as the United States. Members of a California white supremacist street fighting club called the Rise Above Movement, and its founder, Robert Rundo, have attended the Nibelungs tournament. In 2018 at least four Rise Above members were arrested on rioting charges for taking their combat training to the streets at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. A number of Battle of Nibelungs alums have landed in prison, including for manslaughter, assault and attacks on migrants. National Socialism Today, which describes itself as a \"magazine by nationalists for nationalists\" has praised Battle of the Nibelungs and other groups for fostering a will to fight and motivating \"activists to improve their readiness for combat.\" But there are no references to professionalized, anti-government violence on the groups social media feeds. Instead, its positioned as a health-conscious lifestyle brand, which sells branded tea mugs and shoulder bags. \"Exploring nature. Enjoying home!\" gushes one Facebook post above a photo of a musclebound guy on a mountaintop wearing Resistend-branded sportswear, one of the Nibelung tournaments sponsors. All the men in the photos are pumped and white, and they are portrayed enjoying wholesome activities such as long runs and alpine treks. Elsewhere on Facebook, Thorsten Heise - who has been convicted of incitement to hatred and called \"one of the most prominent German neo-Nazis\" by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in the German state of Thuringia -- also maintains multiple pages. Frank Kraemer, who the German government has described as a \"right-wing extremist musician,\" uses his Facebook page to direct people to his blog and his Sonnenkreuz online store, which sells white nationalist and coronavirus conspiracy books as well as sports nutrition products and \"vaccine rebel\" T-shirts for girls. Battle of the Nibelungs declined to comment. Resistend, Heise and Kraemer didnt respond to requests for comment. Facebook told AP it employs 350 people whose primary job is to counter terrorism and organized hate, and that it is investigating the pages and accounts flagged in this reporting. \"We ban organizations and individuals that proclaim a violent mission, or are engaged in violence,\" said a company spokesperson, who added that Facebook had banned more than 250 white supremacist organizations, including groups and individuals in Germany. The spokesperson said the company had removed over 6 million pieces of content tied to organized hate globally between April and June and is working to move even faster. Google said it has no interest in giving visibility to hateful content on YouTube and was looking into the accounts identified in this reporting. The company said it worked with dozens of experts to update its policies on supremacist content in 2019, resulting in a five-fold spike in the number of channels and videos removed. Twitter says its committed to ensuring that public conversation is \"safe and healthy\" on its platform and that it doesnt tolerate violent extremist groups. \"Threatening or promoting violent extremism is against our rules,\" a spokesperson told AP, but did not comment on the specific accounts flagged in this reporting. Robert Claus, who wrote a book on the extreme right martial arts scene, said that the sports brands in CEPs data set are \"all rooted in the militant far-right neo-Nazi scene in Germany and Europe.\" One of the founders of the Battle of the Nibelungs, for example, is part of the violent Hammerskin network and another early supporter, the Russian neo-Nazi Denis Kapustin, also known as Denis Nikitin, has been barred from entering the European Union for ten years, he said. Banning such groups from Facebook and other major platforms would potentially limit their access to new audiences, but it could also drive them deeper underground, making it more difficult to monitor their activities, he said. \"Its dangerous because they can recruit people,\" he said. \"Prohibiting those accounts would interrupt their contact with their audience, but the key figures and their ideology wont be gone.\" Thorsten Hindrichs, an expert in Germanys far-right music scene who teaches at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, said theres a danger that the apparently harmless appearance of Germanys right-wing music heavyweights on Facebook and Twitter, which they mostly use to promote their brands, could help normalize the image of extremists. Extreme right concerts in Germany were drawing around 2 million euros ($2.3 million) a year in revenue before the coronavirus pandemic, he estimated, not counting sales of CDs and branded merchandise. He said kicking extremist music groups off Facebook is unlikely to hit sales too hard, as there are other platforms they can turn to, like Telegram and Gab, to reach their followers. \"Right-wing extremists arent stupid. They will always find ways to promote their stuff,\" he said. None of these groups activity on mainstream platforms is obviously illegal, though it may violate Facebook guidelines that bar \"dangerous individuals and organizations\" that advocate or engage in violence online or offline. Facebook says it doesnt allow praise or support of Nazism, white supremacy, white nationalism or white separatism and bars people and groups that adhere to such \"hate ideologies.\" Last week, Facebook removed almost 150 accounts and pages linked to the German anti-lockdown Querdenken movement, under a new \"social harm\" policy, which targets groups that spread misinformation or incite violence but didnt fit into the platforms existing categories of bad actors. But how these evolving rules will be applied remains murky and contested. \"If you do something wrong on the platform, its easier for a platform to justify an account suspension than to just throw someone out because of their ideology.

Newberg, a town of 25,000 residents situated 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Portland in gorgeous wine country, has become an unlikely focal point of a battle between the left and right across the nation over schooling. The City Council has condemned the action by the Newberg School Board. So did members of color of the Oregon Legislature and House and Senate Democrats. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon is threatening to sue. The Oregon State Board of Education called on the school board to reverse course, saying student identities should be welcomed and affirmed. But the four conservative members of the seven-member board are digging in their heels. Member Brian Shannon, who proposed the ban, said lawmakers from Portland should keep out of the school district\\'s business and instead focus on Portland, where homelessness is an issue. Opponents say the board has emboldened racists. On Sept. 17, a special education staffer at a Newberg elementary school showed up for work in blackface, saying she was portraying anti-segregation icon Rosa Parks in order to protest a statewide vaccine mandate for educators. She was immediately placed on administrative leave. The same week, word emerged that some Newberg students had participated in a Snapchat group in which participants pretended to buy and sell Black fellow students. Newberg Public Schools Superintendent Joe Morelock said there will be an investigation and disciplinary action meted out. Underscoring how deeply the board\\'s action has cut, raw emotion was on display during a virtual public hearing of the board Wednesday night. Some speakers said the board\\'s action is harmful. Others said the signs have no place in schools, saying they\\'re political. Local resident Peggy Kilburg said they should be banned from schools, as well as signs supporting any political position, like National Rifle Association posters. Robert Till, who is gay and a sophomore at Newberg High School, said he is embarrassed to live in Newberg. He cited an estimate from the Trevor Project, a group that aims to end suicide among LGBTQ young people, that at least one LGBTQ person between the ages of 13-24 attempts suicide every 45 seconds in the U.S. \"A simple pride or BLM flag in a classroom shows the love and acceptance that we need,\" Till said, his voice shaking with anger. \"Pride flags can literally save someones life, and youre just going to take that away?\" School board chairman Dave Brown, who voted for the sign ban, declared in an earlier Zoom meeting that \"I\\'m not a racist.\" \"I work with and will always accept those around me no matter what,\" Brown said, an American flag pinned behind him. \"I dont care if theyre gay. I dont care if theyre white or brown or Black. I work with everybody.\" Shannon defended the ban, which hasn\\'t been imposed yet. \"I dont think any of us can deny the fact that these symbols are divisive,\" Shannon said. \"Theyve divided our community and gotten our attention away from where it needs to be, just teaching the basic fundamentals of education.\" Opponents of the ban say it is the board that is being divisive and distracting from the challenges as educators begin in-person instruction with safety protocols after a year of remote teaching because of COVID-19. \"It has been difficult to see a community divided. You can see the anguish on both sides. It makes being an educator harder than it already was,\" said a faculty member at Newberg High School. Speaking on condition she not be named for fear of being harassed online, she said more students than ever are displaying gay pride and Black Lives Matter symbols on lockers, water bottles and laptops since the board took its vote in August. The ban does not apply to students. Alexis Small, a 15-year-old high school junior who is Black, believes the members who endorsed the ban simply don\\'t approve of people who aren\\'t like them. \"The message that I feel is hate,\" Small said in a telephone interview. \"I mean, I cant say that this decision was made out of love or made out of whats best for people. I genuinely think that they did this out of hate.\" In June 2020 -- as Black Lives Matter protests roiled the nation after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis -- the board took a completely different stance, condemning racism and committing to being an anti-racist school district. But conservatives gained a majority in school board elections last May amid a light turnout, and everything changed. Tai Harden-Moore, a Black candidate who lost, recalls a nasty election. Comments on social media supporting her opponent called Harden-Moore un-American and claimed she hated whites, she said. Her campaign signs were ripped from the ground or left in place -- with tree branches placed on top. \"My sign, I\\'ve got my face on it, and so for them to put the branches on it, it was like this weird link to lynching for me,\" Harden-Moore said. Harden-Moore has joined a group called Newberg Equity in Education, which is advocating for inclusion and equity in Newberg schools. The Chehalem Valley Chamber of Commerce told the school board that it has received numerous phone calls and emails from people saying they will boycott Newberg, the valleys main town. \"As business leaders and owners, we are very concerned about the impact this has on our businesses and on the reputation of our community,\" the chamber said, the Newberg Graphic newspaper reported. Newberg Mayor Rick Rogers told the four conservative board members their actions can hurt the town, which features a dozen wine tasting rooms and a university founded by Quakers. \"While you may believe your actions only affect the school district, please know in truth your actions impact us all. To thrive, Newberg must be welcoming to all,\" he wrote. ------ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may not bring the bipartisan infrastructure bill to the House floor Monday as she had previously committed to, she said Sunday. \"I\\'m never bringing to the floor a bill that doesn\\'t have the votes,\" Pelosi told ABC \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos, adding it could be Monday. \"You cannot choose the date,\" Pelosi said. \"You have to go when you have the votes in a reasonable time, and we will.\" Pelosi had previously agreed to put the bipartisan infrastructure bill on the floor to be considered by Sept. 27, after moderates in her caucus demanded a vote. Still, she said of the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, \"Let me just say, we\\'re going to pass the bill this week.\" House progressives have warned leadership they will not vote on the bipartisan bill until the larger $3.5 trillion human infrastructure bill is also ready for a vote. Pelosi acknowledged, \"In order to move forward, we have to build consensus.\" Pelosi said the price tag for that larger bill could drop in negotiations with concessions. \"I know the budget committee passed a resolution calling for $3.5 trillion, but it sounds like you acknowledge that the final number is going to be somewhat smaller than that,\" Stephanopoulos pressed. \"Yeah, I mean, that seems self-evident,\" Pelosi responded. Moderate Democrats, including Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Joe Manchin, D-W.V., have expressed concern over the $3.5 trillion bill\\'s cost and some of its contents. Due to the Democrats\\' narrow Senate majority, they need every member of their caucus to vote for the bill in the Senate in order for it to pass the simple majority required for reconciliation measures. \"We\\'ll see how the number comes down and what we need in that regard, but we have agreed on an array of pay-fors in the legislation,\" Pelosi said. \"This will be paid for.\" \"Obviously with negotiations there will have to be some changes with that, the sooner the better so that we can build our consensus to go forward, and we will do that,\" she also said. On Saturday, the House Budget Committee approved a $3.5 trillion budget resolution that calls for investments in climate change policy, childcare and other social programs. Pelosi told her colleagues in a letter on Saturday they \"must\" pass the bill this week along with a separate bipartisan infrastructure bill. \"The next few days will be a time of intensity,\" she wrote. Pelosi said on \"This Week\" that the House must first deal with the looming potential government shutdown on Oct. 1. The House previously approved a bill that would fund the government until Dec. 3, and it would also suspend the debt limit through December 2022. Senate Republicans are expected to block a procedural vote on Monday because they have said for months now that they want Democrats to handle the debt limit on their own. Stephanopoulos pressed Pelosi on whether her caucus will pass the funding bill. \"Are you confident right now Democrats can pass it on their own?\" Stephanopoulos asked. \"We want this to be bipartisan,\" Pelosi responded. \"If we didn\\'t want it to be bipartisan, we would have put it in the reconciliation bill.\" She added about Republicans, \"Isn\\'t that irresponsible beyond words? The full faith and credit in the United States should not be questioned. That\\'s in the Constitution of the United States.\" Pelosi insisted she wants to raise the debt limit in a bipartisan manner and ruled out lifting the debt limit by using the process of reconciliation, which would only require a simple majority of votes but requires weeks of procedural time. \"This is beyond a big deal,\" Pelosi said. \"So let\\'s hope some of the Republicans -- enough of them -- find some level of responsibility to our country to honor what\\'s in the Constitution, that we not question the full faith and credit of the United States of America.\" \"They know full well what the consequences are,\" Pelosi said.\\nGroups challenging the use of the order argue that it violates U.S. asylum law. President Joe Biden vowed to implement a more humane approach to immigration than his predecessor, but now the Biden administration is facing backlash over its use of a Trump-era order to rapidly expel thousands of migrants, mostly Haitian nationals, without giving them a chance to apply for asylum within the United States. The process is known as Title 42, a reference to part of a U.S. public health code, and according to advocates challenging the administration in court, its use violates U.S. asylum laws. Despite a chorus of criticism from advocates and Democratic lawmakers over the handling of the crisis at the border in Del Rio, Texas, the administration is defending the use of Title 42 in court. After more than a week of growing controversy, immigration authorities in Del Rio, Texas, on Friday finished clearing out an encampment of mostly Haitian migrants that at one point expanded to about 15,000 people. So far, more than a dozen flights have taken about 2,000 people back to Haiti, according to the Department of Homeland Security. About 17,400 have been moved from the camp for processing or to initiate removal proceedings where they will have the chance to claim asylum. About 8,000 at the camp returned to Mexico, according to DHS. What is Title 42? Title 42 is a clause of the 1944 Public Health Services Law that \"allows the government to prevent the introduction of individuals during certain public health emergencies,\" said Olga Byrne, the immigration director at the International Rescue Committee. Rarely used over the past few decades, the Trump administration used an interpretation of Title 42 to issue a public health order during the COVID-19 pandemic to rapidly expel migrants at the border, citing concerns over the spread of the virus, without giving them a chance to apply for asylum, Byrne said. \"U.S. law says that any person in the United States or at the border with the United States has a right to seek asylum,\" said Byrne. \"The legal issue at hand [with the use of Title 42] is that there\\'s nothing in the law that allows the government to expel [migrants] without any due process,\" she added. Between October 2020 and August 2021, 938,045 migrants were expelled under Title 42, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Who is being deported under Title 42? Nearly two week ago, thousands of migrants, mostly Haitian nationals, began arriving at the Texas-Mexico border in Del Rio. At one point, there were more than 14,000 migrants, with thousands sheltering under an international bridge. The influx of migrants from Haiti came after civil unrest erupted this summer following the assassination of Haitian President Jovenal Moise as well as a 7.2 magnitude earthquake that devastated the Caribbean nation. Many Haitian migrants have also been in South America for about a decade ever since the 2010 earthquake caused massive damage and social and economic instability throughout Haiti considered the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. \"We are definitely seeing a high number of Black immigrants, Haitian immigrants in particular, immigrants from the African continent who are not even given the tiniest opportunity to explain their experiences and request asylum,\" said Breanne Palmer, the policy and community advocacy counsel at the UndocuBlack Network, an advocacy group for undocumented Black individuals. When asked last Friday what is being done to remediate the situation in Del Rio and what has caused the recent increase of migrants at that port of entry, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said DHS would continue to use Title 42 to its fullest extent to help expel individuals arriving at the border. \"...we have the authority to expel individuals under the laws that Centers for Disease control have,\" Mayorkas told ABC News. \"It is their public health authority under Title 42 and that is what we will bring to bear to address the situation in Del Rio, Texas.\" Byrne said that the Biden administration has chosen to deport Haitian migrants without screening them for coronavirus, despite the fact that COVID-19 testing is widely available as tourists and travelers have continued to flow into the U.S. through the U.S.-Mexico border. \"Title 42 is the most efficient tool at the government\\'s disposal for quick expulsions to quickly get people out of the U.S. without due process,\" Byrne said. The Biden administration has exempted unaccompanied minors from deportation under Title 42 but is defending in court its use of the public health order to deport families, arguing that lifting the public health order would lead to overcrowding at DHS facilities, and that an influx of migrants along with the delta variant surge, poses a public health risk. The court battle and what\\'s next The American Civil Liberties Union, joined by a group of civil rights organizations, filed a preliminary injunction in court, challenging the expulsion of families under the use of Title 42. \"Anybody who arrives at our border is supposed to be able to seek asylum if they claim a fear of persecution,\" said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, the lead lawyer in the case. \"The Haitian situation is a dramatic and horrific illustration of the harms caused by the Title 42 policy,\" he added. \"... families are literally being pushed back into the arms of persecutors and cartels, without any hearing.\" On Sept. 16, a federal judge granted the injunction, blocking the use of Title 42 to expel families. \"The Title 42 Process is likely unlawful,\" judge Emmitt Sullivan wrote in the ruling, referencing protections for asylum seekers in place under current U.S. immigration laws. But the judge\\'s order, which was appealed by the Biden administration, does not apply to single adults and will not take effect for 14 days or Thursday, Sept. 30. And according to Byrne, because the Biden administration has already applied for a stay of the injunction pending appeal, it is likely that the order will not go into effect on Thursday. In the meantime, the expulsion of migrants has continued. \"The government is using those two weeks now, rather than to organize itself at the border ... to quickly expel as many Haitians as it can,\" Gelernt said. ABC News\\' Luke Barr contributed to this report.\\nNow, a government shutdown could become reality as soon as next week. As he nears 10 months in office, President Joe Biden is at a critical juncture with multiple aspects of his legislative agenda either stalled or in peril on Capitol Hill. \"We\\'re at this stalemate at the moment, and we\\'re going to have to get these two pieces of legislation passed,\" Biden said Friday, referring to his infrastructure agenda. With the prospect of a government shutdown now less than a week away, the presidents infrastructure agenda is also imperiled by a standoff within his own party, bipartisan negotiations over police reform have broken down, election and voting rights reform are stalled in the face of Republican opposition, and there is currently no clear way forward on immigration reform. \"The President won the most votes of any candidate in American history running on his agenda, and he and his team are fighting for the whole of it every day with the backing of strong majorities of the American people on each issue,\" said Andrew Bates, White House deputy press secretary, in a statement to ABC News. He added that Biden is \"undeterred by the obstruction of lobbyists for big-money interests or Republicans in Congress, and has always said that none of this would be easy.\" Infrastructure Still, Biden\\'s top legislative priority to rebuild and invest in the nations infrastructure is teetering in the balance. A $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which already passed the Senate, is supposed to hit the House floor Monday. Progressive Democrats in the House, however, have said they wont support the infrastructure bill unless a social spending package is also passed. Democratic leaders said Thursday they had agreed on a \"framework\" for the money behind that larger, $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, although that figure may not be set. Moderate Democrats have taken issue with the price tag as well as aspects of the legislation, which addresses spending on a variety of social issues, including climate change and health care. Disagreements in the party on the path forward led to multiple meetings between Biden and legislators at the White House on Wednesday. Police reform Bipartisan police reform negotiations broke down Wednesday without anything to show, nearly four months after the one-year anniversary of the murder of George Floyd -- a date that Biden had also once set as a never-materialized deadline to see plans for policing reform on his desk in the Oval Office. Even with what Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said were \"significant strides\" in negotiations, Booker called talks off for good one day after Democrats had made a final offer on the issue. Legislators from both parties working to create a reform framework ultimately couldnt come to an agreement on certain points. Issues of qualified immunity and the involvement of police unions proved to be insurmountable policy differences. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said Wednesday that Democrats didnt give Republicans additional time to consider outstanding points on the plan and instead \"called and threw their hands up.\" Booker said in a statement Wednesday that he wants to seek out other ways to reform policing. Voting rights Despite majorities in both chambers of Congress, multiple attempts by Democrats to move forward with election and voting rights legislation have stalled in the face of Republican opposition. In their latest effort, Senate Democrats last week introduced another version of voting rights legislation to push back against new restrictions in Republican-led states. Introduced earlier this month, The Freedom to Vote Act is a modified version of the For The People Act, a massive election reform bill that failed in June after Senate Republicans unanimously voted against it. But the reintroduced legislation still includes a ban on partisan gerrymandering and measures on campaign finance and election security, among other broad-scale changes to elections in the U.S. In March, Biden siged an executive order directing federal agencies to expand voter registration opportunities and participate in the electoral process. Biden pushed hard for voting rights -- a key agenda item after 2020 -- at a June speech in Philadelphia when he was advocating the For The People Act. \"We\\'re going to face another test in 2022: A new wave of unprecedented voter suppression, and raw and sustained election subversion. We have to prepare now,\" Biden told the crowd at the National Constitution Center. Moderate Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., said last week he was working to rally GOP support for the Freedom to Vote Act, since the bill will likely need 60 votes to advance. But it is unlikely to garner enough bipartisan support to pass. Immigration reform As the Biden administration now faces strong backlash over the mass expulsion of Haitian migrants at the southern border and images of aggressive tactics used by Border Patrol agents on horseback, the presidents legislative agenda on immigration reform faces no clear way forward. Democrats\\' latest attempt to address immigration reform as part of the reconciliation process -- which allows legislation to pass with a simple majority -- was blocked by the Senate parliamentarian on Sunday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that Democrats aimed to find a workaround to the parliamentarians ruling. Government shutdown Now, a government shutdown could become reality as soon as next week. Democrats have paired extending government funding, which expires at the end of September, with raising the countrys debt limit. Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said they wont raise the countrys debt ceiling because they oppose spending Democrats have proposed . Raising the debt ceiling pays for previous expenditures, not future spending, and Republicans have helped raise it in the past. The White House Office of Management and Budget sent guidance to federal government agencies Thursday in case of a government shutdown. \"We are doing everything we can to prevent a government shutdown,\" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing Thursday. \"Were right now in the midst of trying to get a historic package that\\'s going to address a lot of issues the American people care about across the finish line.\" ABC News\\' Mariam Khan, Ben Gittleson, Trish Turner, Rachel Scott, Briana Stewart, Michelle Stoddart, Benjamin Siegel and Meredith Deliso contributed to this report.\\nWASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden says that talks over his $3.5 trillion rebuilding plan have hit a \"stalemate\" in Congress as he made the case for his expansive effort to recast the nation\\'s tax and spending programs and make what he sees as sweeping, overdue investments. Biden spoke at the White House as Democrats in the House and Senate are laboring to finish drafts and overcome differences between the party\\'s centrist and moderate factions. Despite efforts by the president and congressional leaders to show progress, Biden on Friday cast the road ahead as long and potentially cumbersome, even with upcoming deadlines. \"Were getting down to the hard spot here,\" Biden told reporters at the White House. \"Were at this stalemate at the moment.\" Biden said the process is \"going to be up and down\" but \"hopefully at the end of the day I\\'ll be able to deliver on what I said I would do.\" The president\\'s acknowledgment of Democrats\\' disagreements -- and they have serious differences over taxes, health, climate change and the ultimate price tag -- contrasted with congressional leaders\\' more upbeat tone in recent days. Using carefully chosen words, top Democrats have seemed to be trying to create a sense of momentum as House votes approach. On Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., predicted passage of both pillars of Biden\\'s domestic agenda. One is a still-evolving $3.5 trillion package of social safety net and climate programs, the other a separate $1 trillion measure financing highway, internet and other infrastructure projects that\\'s already passed the Senate with bipartisan support. \"We\\'re going to pass both bills,\" she told reporters. But she did not spell out how she and her Senate counterpart, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would resolve disagreements and distrust between their party\\'s moderate and progressive wings that\\'s stalled both measures. And there remained confusion about the voting schedule, which will be crucial. Pelosi promised House moderates last month that by this Monday, the chamber will consider the infrastructure bill, centrists\\' top priority. But progressives are threatening to vote to derail the infrastructure legislation until a final version of their favorite -- the $3.5 trillion social and environment bill -- passes the Senate and returns to the House. Progressives think delaying the public works bill would pressure moderates to back the larger measure. \"Were bringing the bill up, we will have a vote when we have the votes,\" Pelosi told a reporter Friday about the infrastructure bill\\'s timing. While she said debate would begin Monday, her remarks suggested that final passage of the public works legislation could slip. Pelosi also told reporters that \"the plan\" was for her chamber to consider the $3.5 trillion package next week as well. It remained unclear how House-Senate bargainers would solve their differences over that bill that quickly. The president said his private meetings with some two dozen Democratic lawmakers this week in efforts to hasten progress and close the deal went well -- describing the tone as collegial and with \"no hollering.\" But as lawmakers raised objections over the sweep and scope of the plan, which is to be funded by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, Biden said he tried to get them focused on priorities -- what they can and can\\'t live with. \"Its about paying your fair share, for lords sake,\" Biden said. \"There clearly is enough, from a panoply of options, to pay for whatever it is.\" In a stark reality check, Biden suggested talks could drag to the end of the year. \"Its just going to take some time,\" he said. Lawmakers are working nonstop and Biden is facing pressure to close the deal. Pelosi met Friday at the Capitol with her leadership team, and the House Budget Committee planned a rare Saturday session to take the strictly procedural step of sending the $3.5 trillion bill, as drafted by 13 other House panels, to the full chamber without any changes. Before the House votes on that measure, it is certain to change, perhaps more than once, to reflect compromises reached with Senate Democrats. Biden\\'s big vision over his \"Build Back Better\" campaign promise proposes expanding health, education and federal programs, with more services for Americans of all ages, while investing heavily in efforts to tackle climate change. All this would be paid for largely by hiking tax rates on corporations and wealthy individuals, those earning beyond $400,000 a year, or $450,000 for married couples. But centrist Democrats see the overall price tag as too much, while progressive lawmakers are hesitant to compromise any further after already having dropped even more ambitious ideas. ------ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.\\n\"What I went through, you\\'ll never believe,\" said former performer Read Scot. The Chippendales are known for one of the sexiest shows in entertainment, but, in the beginning, behind the glitz and glam, greed eventually led to violence -- and murder. A new Discovery+ series, \"Curse of the Chippendales,\" sets forth to expose the intimate details of owner Steve Banerjee\\'s murder-for-hire plot. \"Everything about Banerjee was about making money,\" said Scott Garriola, a former FBI agent and the investigator on the Chippendales case. Read Scot, a former Chippendales\\' performer, said he was once a target on Banerjee\\'s list. \"What I went through, you\\'ll never believe,\" said Read Scot. In 1979, Banerjee opened the first Chippendales, featuring male strippers, in west Los Angeles. \"It was the first time ever where something was completely geared to the ladies,\" said Candace Mayeron, a former producer for the Chippendales. The idea proved revolutionary, creating an overnight success. Banerjee, an immigrant from Mumbai, India, quickly became one of the most well-known club owners of the time. \"The popularity, I think, was the first time that the equality door was kicked open for women to get the same kind of entertainment options that men have had for years,\" said Scot, \"They could be rowdy, rude, vulgar even like men.\" In the early 1980s, Banerjee decided he wanted to take the show across the country, so he hired former television producer Nick De Noia to help with the expansion. \"The partnership between Steve and Nick, you know, became fruitful. And that\\'s how the clubs took off. And they eventually opened up a club in New York,\" said Garriola. According to Scot, Banerjee and De Noia\\'s relationship began to sour, and they would often clash over the creative direction of the show. Scot said Banerjee cared more about performer\\'s attractiveness, while De Noia cared more for production. \"[Banerjee] pretty much let me know, \\'You are a very good performer, Read. But you are not a looker,\" Scot recalled. Banerjee and De Noia cut a deal where Banerjee would take the Chippendales business and De Noia would get the rights to a touring version of the Chippendales. \"Taking Chippendales on the road eventually turned out to be the most lucrative part of the business,\" said Garriola, who added that Banerjee became frustrated with De Noia\\'s success. Banerjee hired Ray Colon to help carry out an attack on his business partner. Colon recruited an accomplice named Gilberto Rivera. On April 7, 1987, Colon and Rivera travelled to the Chippendales office in New York, according to Garriola. Rivera shot De Noia in his office, and the two men escaped before police arrived. At the time, nothing linked Banerjee to the murder, and business went on as usual. According to Scot, suspicion began to arise when Banerjee bought back the touring rights from the De Noia family for $1 million. Meanwhile, other male strip clubs began to pop up across the country, including \"Adonis,\" which was started by a group of former Chippendales dancers and which hired Scot as the emcee. \"They were directly now competing with Chippendales. So what would you expect Bannerjee to do when he has a competition? He wanted these people killed,\" said Garriola. In 1991, Scot was with \"Adonis\" in England, when he said he learned he was in danger. \"There are two gentlemen in suits, and they introduce themselves as FBI,\" said Scot, who said the investigators said they had intercepted a call. \"[They] said, \\'We believe someone is out to get you.\\'\" Investigators would later learn that Banerjee had hired Colon again to target Adonis employees. Colon hired a different accomplice, someone called Strawberry. \"[Colon] gave them an eyedropper bottle full of cyanide,\" said Garriola. \"[Strawberry] took all this, he flew over there, got cold feet.\" Garriola said Strawberry came back to the U.S. and went to the FBI. Shortly thereafter, authorities arrested Colon and brought him in for questioning. Colon told authorities Banerjee was behind De Noia\\'s murder and the plot against Adonis. Garriola said they decided to set up a sting operation to secretly record Banerjee admitting to his role in the crimes. \"We\\'re going to construct a ruse where we\\'re going to take Colon out of the country, make believe that he has become a fugitive,\" said Garriola. \"Once he gets overseas, he\\'ll call Banerjee.\" Banerjee met Colon in Switzerland to discuss business, and the FBI secretly recorded their conversation. \"We hear Banerjee confess to his complicity in hiring Ray Colon for the murder of De Noia. They talk about the attempted murders of Read Scot and other dancers,\" said Garriola. \"We\\'re able to get the evidence that we needed.\" Banerjee was arrested in September 1993 and pleaded guilty to racketeering, which including arranging De Noia\\'s murder. However, in 1994, a day before Banerjee was to be sentenced, he died by suicide. \"He didn\\'t get the punishment he deserved. He didn\\'t serve the time for Nick De Noia, for destroying lives, for trying to kill people,\" said Scot. \"He got out easy. He was a coward.\"\\nFormer White House press secretary Sarah Sanders might be running for governor of Arkansas, but she\\'s not talking much about the state CABOT, Ark. -- She\\'s toured the state in an RV emblazoned with her name, launched a TV ad that\\'s airing during Arkansas Razorbacks football games and spoken to packed rooms at restaurants. Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders\\' introduction as a candidate for governor hasn\\'t strayed from most campaigns here. Except for the crowds, which are far beyond what people have seen in this mostly rural place. And the campaign talk, which often isn\\'t about the state. \"As I travel around the state, I keep hearing this criticism, \\'Oh, there\\'s that Sarah Sanders, nationalizing the race,\\'\" Sanders told hundreds of people packed at a Colton\\'s Steak House in Cabot, a half-hour drive from the state capital of Little Rock. \"And my answer to those people is, \\'You bet I am. Because if you\\'re not paying attention to what is happening in this country, you\\'re missing what is going on.\" Sanders\\' celebrity as former President Donald Trump\\'s spokesperson granted her immediate front-runner status in one of the nation\\'s most Trump-friendly states. It\\'s also transforming politics in a place where voters in state races are used to hearing overwhelmingly about Arkansas taxes, Arkansas roads and Arkansas schools. This is hardly the only state where local politics isn\\'t local anymore. Republican candidates for governor elsewhere also are focused more on President Joe Biden than their own opponents and on federal, rather than state, issues. And many Democrats would rather talk about Trump than about their rivals. \"Her approach suggests she understands the contemporary electorate in Arkansas and everywhere,\" said Janine Parry, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas. Politics, Parry said, \"is in a period of profound nationalization.\" It\\'s a sharp contrast with past races for governor in Arkansas, where Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson campaigned on requiring computer science education in schools. His predecessor, Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe, ran on phasing out the sales tax on groceries. Sanders, 39, announced her bid in January with a promise to fight the \"radical left,\" something that\\'s awfully hard to find in solidly red Arkansas. On Twitter and elsewhere, she rails against Biden on his coronavirus pandemic response, immigration and the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"Sarah Sanders is not running for governor of Arkansas. She is running on a national stage,\" said Michael John Gray, a former chair of the state Democratic Party, who\\'s now heading an independent committee focused primarily on defeating Sanders\\' bid. Sanders\\' approach reflects just how polarized the country has become in recent years. Invoking unpopular national Democratic figures is seen as the best voter-motivating tactic, even in local races. In Iowa, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who is expected to run for reelection, is criticizing Biden on numerous issues including federal spending. In Oklahoma, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who faces reelection next year, has had little to say about his states battle with COVID-19 -- which hit the grim milestone of 10,000 deaths this week -- but issued a slick video on Biden\\'s Afghanistan performance. Some Democrats are also leaning national. California Gov. Gavin Newsom defeated a recall attempt earlier this month with a campaign that railed against \"Trumpism.\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is campaigning on abortion rights and gun control, and at a recent rally, he criticized states like Florida and Texas for their right-wing policies. When Sanders does talk about Arkansas, she does so only in broad strokes. She says she\\'s tired of the state being at the bottom of many rankings. She said she wants to eliminate the state\\'s income tax, though she offers no hints on how. She also mentions doing something on education and workforce training, which she said hasn\\'t changed substantially since her father, Mike Huckabee, was governor from 1996 to 2007. \"We have to stop just trying to push kids through the system and actually focus on how are we preparing them to go into the workforce,\" she told The Associated Press. Though best known for her White House briefings, during which she sparred with reporters and faced questions about her truthfulness, Sanders is no stranger to the state\\'s politics. She appeared in TV ads for her dad\\'s campaigns in the 1990s and early 2000s and chaired Arkansas Sen. John Boozman\\'s campaign. She\\'s mostly steered clear of referring to the current governor, Hutchinson, whom Trump has branded as a RINO, or Republican in Name Only, after he vetoed an anti-transgender bill. Hutchinson is barred by the state\\'s term limits from running for governor again. Her first TV ad features footage of her dad and former President Bill Clinton as they marked the 40th anniversary of Little Rock Central High School\\'s desegregation. It quickly pivots to a favorite target, claiming that the \"radical left wants to teach our kids America is a racist and evil country.\" Sanders embarked on a statewide tour this month that included a rally with country singer John Rich that drew 1,000 people and a parade on Lake Ouachita that her campaign said included more than 1,500 boats. At her stop in Cabot -- a city of about 25,000 -- Sanders got the loudest applause when she talked about Trump. \"I\\'m proud of the fact I worked with a president who did exactly what he said he was going to do,\" she said. Sanders\\' only rival in the Republican primary, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, has lagged far behind in fundraising. Sanders in July reported raising $9 million since she announced her candidacy, with the majority of the money coming from out of state. Rutledge says there\\'s little accomplishment behind Sanders\\' rhetoric. \"While my opponent talks about the liberal left in Washington, D.C., she has done nothing to effectively combat them in the last several years,\" Rutledge told the AP. Democrats, who face an uphill climb, are trying to highlight Sanders\\' White House stint as a sign she can\\'t bring people together. But in Arkansas, where Trump won with more than 62% of the vote, her hyperpartisan past is an asset to many. In Cabot, some in the mostly unmasked audience donned red Trump hats and shirts depicting the former president. \"Everything she stands for is just maintaining the American way, the conservative way of life, keeping our rights alive,\" said Kristen Harrington, who works at a honey company in Cabot and who wore a shirt that read \"Mean Tweets 2024.\" Harold Glenn Earnest, a 96-year-old veteran from tiny Romance, about 30 miles north of Cabot, whom Sanders talked with at the eatery, said he\\'s already thinking beyond the governor\\'s mansion for Sanders. \"She\\'ll be the governor. There\\'s no question about that,\" Earnest said. \"I want to see her run for president.\" ---- Associated Press writers Kathleen Ronayne, David Pitt, Marc Levy, Michael Catalini and Sean Murphy contributed to this report.\\nOfficials say a banking error has caused dozens of Florida teachers to see their state-issued $1,000 bonus checks bounce TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A banking error has caused dozens of Florida teachers to see their state-issued $1,000 bonus checks bounce, officials said Friday. Disaster relief payments issued to about 50 of the 176,000 educators who received checks were affected by the JPMorgan Chase error, according to a statement from the Florida Department of Education. Officials said they\\'re working to fix the problem. \"We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused and are working to correct it, including refunding any fees incurred by the recipients as a result,\" JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Allison Tobin Reed said in an email. State Sen. Jason Pizzo, D-Miami, brought attention to the error Friday morning when he tweeted a photo of a teacher\\'s return item notice that was received after trying to deposit the check. Funded by federal COVID-19 relief money, the bonus payments to teachers, principals and first responders received bipartisan support in the Florida Legislature this past spring. But some criticized Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis for hiring a private company to print and mail the checks, along with a letter signed by the governor, instead of sending money to local school districts to distribute. Pizzo tweeted later Friday, \"Teaching moment: The individual political benefit in spending $3.6 million to print and send thousands of checks with your name on it, is outweighed by the more efficient and fiscally responsible option of direct deposit.\" State officials have said the $3.6 million is well below the 10% normally used for administrative costs for federal funding.\\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla said on ABC\\'s \"This Week\" Sunday it\\'s possible to provide both COVID-19 booster shots as well as doses for people who have not yet been vaccinated. \"I think it is also not the right thing to try to resolve it with an \\'or\\' when you can resolve it with an \\'and,\\'\" Bourla told \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos. \"It\\'s not, \\'Shall we give boosters or give primary doses to other people.\\' I think the answer should be, \\'Let\\'s give both boosters and doses for other people.\\'\" With millions more Americans now newly eligible for a booster COVID-19 shot from Pfizer, Bourla\\'s optimism punctuates what\\'s become a protracted, hot-button issue amongst the scientific community over who needs the boost and when. The White House has stressed that the rationale for green-lighting boosters must be uncoupled from the question of global vaccinations and that one does not preclude the other. Just after midnight Friday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky endorsed her independent advisory panel\\'s recommendation for seniors and other medically vulnerable Americans to get a booster shot of Pfizer\\'s COVID-19 vaccine six months after their second dose, partially overruling the panel by adding a recommendation for a third dose for people who are considered high risk due to where they work. On \"This Week\" Sunday, Bourla called that decision a \"very good one.\" \"We are looking forward to being able to vaccinate all these vulnerable people so that we can put an end to this pandemic,\" Bourla told Stephanopoulos. The CDC\\'s final sign-off at least in part buttoned up what has become a seething scientific debate on the issue. The Biden administration announced there would be \"boosters-for-all\" before any review from federal regulatory bodies or their independent groups, and while some political appointees had endorsed that timeline, some federal career scientists and advisers vehemently objected to the incomplete data they were being asked to assess -- and that there should be a more global focus on getting more first shots in arms. The booster debate has played out amid the delta variant\\'s surge, even as the World Health Organization has reupped their call for a moratorium on booster shots in the interest of more equitable distribution of primary vaccinations, as many countries are still struggling with providing first and second doses. Pharmaceutical companies have faced criticism for not doing enough, Stephanopoulos expressed, pointing out a tweet from Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC director under President Barack Obama. \"While focusing on selling expensive vaccines to rich countries, Moderna and Pfizer are doing next to nothing to close the global gap in vaccine supply. Shameful,\" Frieden wrote. \"He believes you should be waiving intellectual property to speed vaccine distribution. Is that a good idea?\" Stephanopoulos asked. Bourla pushed back on the criticism and said he doesn\\'t think it\\'s a good idea. \"Intellectual property is what created the thriving life sciences sector that was ready when the pandemic hit,\" Bourla said. \"Always there is more we can do, but I want to make sure people understand what we are doing right now.\" That includes, he said, the commitment Pfizer has made to be able to produce billions of vaccine doses for both primary shots and boosters and pricing them lower for middle- and low-income countries. Meanwhile, as the academic year kicks off in into the pandemic\\'s uncertainty for a second time -- and as pediatric COVID infections have soared to alarming levels -- Pfizer\\'s Bourla told Stephanopoulos they expected to submit their data to the FDA for review very soon. On Wednesday, Pfizer released its first safety data about COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, reassuring parents that a safe and effective vaccine soon could be available for those younger than 12. In a trial of more than 2,200 children, results showed a smaller dose of Pfizer\\'s vaccine -- one-third the amount given to adults and adolescents 12 and up -- provided robust and adequate immune responses among those ages 5 to 11. \"I think we are going to submit this data pretty soon. It\\'s a question of days, not weeks,\" Bourla said, deferring to the regulatory review process for final answers. If and when the FDA does agree with Pfizer\\'s assessment, Bourla said his company is poised to finally begin providing shots to younger children. In the midst of the promising data his company has touted, however, Bourla tempered his prediction for when the U.S. and world could finally return to \"normal life,\" underscoring progress is dependent on improved vaccine uptake and some measure of herd immunity. While he said \"within a year\" he believes \"normal life\" will make a return, \"The most likely scenario for me is that because the virus is spread all over the world, we will continue seeing new variants that are coming out.\" With that, he predicts annual vaccinations will be the norm. \"But we don\\'t know. We need to wait and see the data,\" he added. ABC News\\' Eric M. Strauss contributed to this report.\\nWASHINGTON -- What will it cost to enact President Joe Bidens massive expansion of social programs? Congress has authorized spending up to $3.5 trillion over a decade, but Biden is prodding Democrats to fully cover the cost of the legislation -- by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy, negotiating the price of prescription drugs and dialing up other sources of federal revenue such as increased IRS funding. The idea is that entire package should pay for itself. Defending a bill not yet fully drafted, Democrats are determined to avoid a deficit financed spending spree. They are growing frustrated by the focus on the proposed $3.5 trillion spending total, arguing far too little attention is being paid to the work they are doing to balance the books. Biden on Friday said he would prefer the price tag described as \"zero.\" \"We pay for everything we spend,\" Biden said at the White House. \"Its going to be zero. Zero.\" But the revenue side of the equation is vexing, and its emerged as a core challenge for Democratic bargainers as they labor to construct one of the largest legislative efforts in a generation. Their success or failure could help determine whether the bulk of Bidens agenda becomes law and can withstand the political attacks to come. Republicans, lockstep in opposition, arent waiting for the details. Theyve trained their focus on the $3.5 trillion spending ceiling set by Democrats, pillorying that sum as fiscally reckless, misguided, big government at its worst. \"The radical left is pushing in all their chips -- they want to use this terrible but temporary pandemic as a Trojan horse for permanent socialism,\" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Thursday. \"Trillions upon trillions more in government spending when families are already facing inflation.\" Part of the problem for Democratic leaders is the lack of a consensus about which programs to fund and for how long. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., acknowledge the price will likely come down and say they have a \"menu\" of revenue raisers to pay for it. But without certainty on what initiatives will be included, no final decisions can be made. \"This is not about price tag,\" Pelosi said Thursday. \"This is about whats in the bill.\" Biden and administration officials stress the plan is as much about fairness as dollars and cents. By taxing the wealthy and corporations, they hope to fund paid family leave and child tax credits that help those reaching for the middle class, all while adopting environmental and economic policies that help the U.S. compete with China. But the haggling over a final spending target is overshadowing the policy goals they are trying achieve. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a lead negotiator for House progressives, said Friday that reporters should not depict the measure as costing trillions of dollars when the accompanying proposed tax increases would cover the cost. \"I just believe that this is going to be a zero-dollar-bill -- thats the No. 1 priority,\" she said. Sharron Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank based in Washington, warned Democrats that emphasizing the $3.5 trillion figure could detract from what they are trying to achieve. \"The debate so far has been overly focused on a single number: the $3.5 trillion in gross new investments over the next ten years -- including both spending increases and tax cuts -- that may be included in the package,\" Parrott wrote in an August blog post. \"True fiscal stewardship requires a focus on the net cost of the package and, even more fundamentally, a focus on the merits of the investment and offset proposals themselves.\" What Biden is really pushing are two goals that can easily come into conflict. He wants to restore the middle class to the epicenter of economic growth, but do so without worsening the national debt or raising taxes on people earning less than $400,000 a year. Further complicating things is that many of his spending policies are actually tax cuts for the poor and middle class, which means he is raising taxes for one group in order to cut them for another. Democrats also have to contend with how the measures are assessed by the Congressional Budget Office, the final arbiter of how the legislation will affect the federal balance sheet. The Democrats expanded child credit and dependent care credits, enacted earlier this year, are counted as costs in a CBO score. Biden wants to extend these programs as part of the budget, which he is now arguing amounts to one of the largest middle-class tax cuts in U.S. history. \"Its reducing taxes, not increasing taxes,\" Biden said Friday. Its not entirely clear whether Bidens claim of \"zero\" cost is feasible under the 10-year outlook used by the CBO to assess the economic impacts of legislation. Bidens own budget officials earlier this year estimated that his agenda would increase the national debt by nearly $1.4 trillion over the decade. Biden on Friday described the multi-tiered talks with legislators as at a \"stalemate.\" More meetings are expected in coming days. In the evenly split Senate, key Democratic senators such as West Virginias Joe Manchin and Arizonas Kyrsten Sinema have qualms about the total spending. Democratic moderates are jockeying for advantage against their liberal counterparts. With time running short, Biden is asking for more patience to get the numbers right so that the votes will follow. \"This is a process,\" he said. \"But its just gonna take some time.\"\\nSan Diego police are investigating the deaths of a woman and her 2-year-old son Saturday after they fell from the third level of Petco Park, just as thousands of baseball fans were heading inside for a Padres game, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported SAN DIEGO -- San Diego police are investigating the deaths of a woman and her 2-year-old son Saturday after they fell from the third level of Petco Park, just as thousands of baseball fans were heading inside for a Padres game, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. The woman, 40, and the boy were pronounced dead at 4:11 p.m., about 20 minutes after police were alerted to the incident, Lt. Andra Brown told the newspaper. The pair fell from the third level concourse -- the equivalent of six stories high -- to the sidewalk below on Tony Gwynn Drive, Brown said. Their names were not released; both lived in San Diego. The mother and child had been at a dining/concession area on the concourse level prior to the fall, Lt. Adam T. Sharki said. The childs father was at the ballpark when the deaths occurred, police reported. Police told the Union-Tribune it is too early to know whether the fall was accidental or intentional but noted that the victims deaths \"appeared to be suspicious.\" Brown said investigators understand that there may have been a number of people in the concourse area who might have more information, which, she said, could potentially \"give the family some peace.\"\\nAn officer in the nations capital has been indicted on a murder charge for his role in a fatal vehicle accident during a police chase that sparked two days of protests and clashes WASHINGTON -- An officer in the nations capital has been indicted on a murder charge for his role in a fatal vehicle accident during a police chase that sparked two days of protests and clashes. Federal prosecutors announced Friday that Terrence Sutton, 37, was indicted on second-degree murder, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges in connection with the death of 20-year-old Karon Hylton-Brown, who died after a pursuit in Washington, D.C. in October 2020. Hylton died after his moped crashed into a car while he was being pursued by Sutton and other police officers. City police regulations forbid high-speed pursuits over minor traffic violations. Police have said officers tried to stop Hylton because he was riding his moped on the sidewalk without a helmet. Body camera footage released by the Metropolitan Police Department showed the officers in a police cruiser chasing Hylton for several blocks with their lights flashing, at one point doing a U-turn when Hylton reverses course right in front of the cruiser. The chase continues into an alley. When Hyltons vehicle emerges from the alley, it slams into the passenger side door of a passing car. The pursuit appeared to violate the departments policy prohibiting chases. A police lieutenant, Andrew Zabavsky, 53, who prosecutors say was the highest-ranking officer at the scene, was also indicted on conspiracy and obstruction charges. Prosecutors allege he withheld information from other police officials and delayed notifying internal investigators about the incident. Sutton and Zabavsky pleaded not guilty in court Friday. Sutton\\'s attorney, J. Michael Hannon, said the policeman believed he was the victim of a \"tragic double-cross of his commitment to law enforcement,\" The Washington Post reported. Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee said Friday that the department would fully cooperate with the U.S. Attorneys office, noting, \"This is the process of accountability.\"\\nUtah sophomore cornerback Aaron Lowe has died in a shooting at house party less than a year after teammate Ty Jordan was killed in an accidental shooting SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah sophomore cornerback Aaron Lowe died in a shooting at house party early Sunday, less than a year after teammate Ty Jordan was killed in an accidental shooting. Salt Lake City police said the 21-year-old Lowe was killed just after midnight, a few hours after the Utes beat Washington State 24-13. A second victim in the shooting, a woman, is in critical condition and police are searching for a suspect. \"We are devastated to hear about the passing of Aaron Lowe,\" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said in a statement. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Aarons family and friends, along with the other individual who was harmed in this tragic incident. Aaron was a great teammate, friend, brother and son and was loved by anyone who crossed paths with him. He will be deeply missed.\" Lowe was a high school teammate of Jordan\\'s in Mesquite, Texas, and switched his jersey from No. 2 to 22 to honor his friend after the 19-year-old died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen on Christmas night 2020. Last month, Lowe was named the first recipient of the Ty Jordan Memorial Scholarship, voted on by the team. \"Ty made everyone around him better,\" Lowe said after receiving the honor in August. \"He made me better. My friendship with Ty means a lot because he was always pushing me to be my best. He never let me settle for less. I want to make sure his legacy lives on through me.\" The Utes credited Lowe for persuading Jordan to play at Utah after decommitting from the school. Jordan was named the Pac-12 freshman of the year and led all freshmen nationally in rushing yards per game before he was killed. Lowe appeared in 16 combined games on special teams his first two seasons and played in all four games this season. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox also tweeted his condolences to Lowe\\'s family.\\nWASHINGTON -- Democrats pushed a $3.5 trillion, 10-year bill strengthening social safety net and climate programs through the House Budget Committee on Saturday, but one Democrat voted \"no,\" illustrating the challenges party leaders face in winning the near unanimity they\\'ll need to push the sprawling package through Congress. The Democratic-dominated panel, meeting virtually, approved the measure on a near party-line vote, 20-17. Passage marked a necessary but minor checking of a procedural box for Democrats by edging it a step closer to debate by the full House. Under budget rules, the committee wasnt allowed to significantly amend the 2,465-page measure, the product of 13 other House committees. More important work has been happening in an opaque procession of mostly unannounced phone calls, meetings and other bargaining sessions among party leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers. President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have led a behind-the-scenes hunt for compromises to resolve internal divisions and, they hope, allow approval of the mammoth bill soon. Pelosi told fellow Democrats Saturday that they \"must\" pass the social and environment package this week, along with a separate infrastructure bill and a third measure preventing a government shutdown on Friday. Her letter to colleagues underscored the pile of crucial work Congress\\' Democratic majority faces in coming days and seemed an effort to build urgency to resolve long-standing disputes quickly. \"The next few days will be a time of intensity,\" she wrote. Moderate Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., joined all 16 Republicans on the Budget committee in opposing the legislation. His objections included one that troubles many Democrats: a reluctance to back a bill with provisions that would later be dropped by the Senate. Many Democrats don\\'t want to become politically vulnerable by backing language that might be controversial back home, only to see it not become law. That preference for voting only on a social and environment bill that\\'s already a House-Senate compromise could complicate Pelosi\\'s effort for a House vote this week. Peters was among three Democrats who earlier this month voted against a plan favored by most in his party to lower pharmaceutical costs by letting Medicare negotiate for the prescription drugs it buys. Party leaders have tried for weeks to resolve differences among Democrats over the package\\'s final price tag, which seems sure to shrink. There are also disputes over which initiatives should be reshaped, among them expanded Medicare, tax breaks for children and health care, a push toward cleaner energy and higher levies on the rich and corporations. Democrats\\' wafer-thin majorities in the House and Senate mean compromise is mandatory. Before the measure the Budget panel approved Saturday even reaches the House floor, it is expected to be changed to reflect whatever House-Senate accords have been reached, and additional revisions are likely. The overall bill embodies the crux of Biden\\'s top domestic goals. Budget panel chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., cited \"decades of disinvestment\" on needs like health care, education, child care and the environment as the rationale for the legislation. \"The futures of millions of Americans and their families are at stake. We can no longer afford the costs of neglect and inaction. The time to act is now,\" Yarmuth said. Republicans say the proposal is unneeded, unaffordable amid accumulated federal debt exceeding $28 trillion and reflects Democrats\\' drive to insert government into people\\'s lives. Its tax boosts will cost jobs and include credits for buying electric vehicles, purchases often made by people with comfortable incomes, they said. \"This bill is a disaster for working-class families,\" said Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, the committees top Republican. \"Its a big giveaway to the wealthy, its a laundry list of agenda items pulled right out of the Bernie Sanders socialist playbook.\" The unusual weekend session occurred as top Democrats amp up efforts to end increasingly bitter disputes between the party\\'s centrist and progressive wings that threaten to undermine Biden\\'s agenda. Biden conceded Friday that talks among Democrats were at a \"stalemate,\" though Pelosi and Schumer have been more positive in an apparent effort to build momentum and soothe differences. A collapse of the measure at his own party\\'s hands would be a wounding preview to the coming election year, in which House and Senate control are at stake. To nail down moderates\\' support for an earlier budget blueprint, Pelosi promised to begin House consideration by Monday of another pillar of Biden\\'s domestic plans: a $1 trillion collection of roadway and other infrastructure projects. Pelosi reaffirmed this week that the infrastructure debate would begin Monday. But many moderates who consider the infrastructure bill their top goal also want to cut the $3.5 trillion social and environment package and trim or reshape some programs. They include Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. In response, progressives -- their top priority is the $3.5 trillion measure -- are threatening to vote against the infrastructure bill if it comes up for a vote first. Their opposition seems likely to be enough to scuttle it, and Pelosi hasn\\'t definitively said when a vote on final passage of the infrastructure measure will occur. With each portion of the party threatening to upend the other\\'s most cherished goal -- a political disaster in the making for Democrats -- top Democrats are using the moment to accelerate talks on the massive social and climate legislation. The party can lose no votes in the Senate and a maximum of three in the House to succeed in the narrowly split Congress.\\nThe 6-year-old girl who died on a ride at a Colorado amusement park earlier this month was never strapped into her seat -- and two operators failed to notice even after a monitor alerted them to a seatbelt safety issue -- before the ride plunged 110 feet, according to a state investigation. Wongel Estifanos was visiting Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park, located atop Iron Mountain in Glenwood Springs, with her family on Sept. 5 when she went on the Haunted Mine Drop ride, a free-fall drop down a pitch-black shaft. After reviewing video surveillance and operating manuals, investigators with the Colorado Division of Oil and Public Safety determined that when Wongel got on the ride, she sat in a previously unoccupied seat on top of two already-locked seatbelts, and that \"multiple operator errors\" and \"inadequate training\" contributed to the fatal accident, according to a report released Friday. The girl was only holding the tail of one seatbelt across her lap, but when checking her seat, a ride operator \"did not notice that the seatbelts were not positioned across her lap,\" according to the report. The ride\\'s control panel alerted the operator to an error with one of the seatbelts on Wongel\\'s seat, indicating that that seatbelt had not been properly unlocked after the previous ride cycle, according to the report. The operator returned \"multiple times\" to check the seatbelt and buckle it to no avail, but \"did not believe the error because they were convinced the restraint had been cycled,\" the report stated. A second ride operator then unlocked the seatbelts using a manual switch, clearing the error on the ride\\'s control system, \"without unloading passengers to determine what the issue was,\" the report stated. This decision did not resolve the problem -- that Wongel was not wearing the seatbelts -- and demonstrated that the operator \"did not have a complete understanding\" of the control system\\'s safety indicators, according to the report. The second operator also checked the girl\\'s seatbelts but \"did not notice that neither of the seatbelts were positioned across her lap,\" according to the report. With no error on the control panel, the second operator was then able to dispatch the ride. \"Because Ms. Estifanos was not restrained in the seat she became separated from her seat and fell to the bottom of the [Haunted Mine Drop] shaft, resulting in her death,\" the report stated. Operators were not formally trained to unbuckle all seatbelts following each ride, though it was common practice and one that the first operator performed \"inconsistently\" on earlier rides, according to the report. The operators are supposed to buckle the seatbelts for each of the ride\\'s six passengers and confirm the restraints are over their laps, per the manufacturer\\'s operating manual, as \"passengers cannot be expected to know or correctly execute the safety procedures for this ride,\" the report stated. Both operators failed to follow these procedures, according to the report. The report also determined that the operators\\' training \"did not appear to emphasize the inherent risks of the ride,\" and that the manufacturer\\'s operating manual \"does not instruct operators on how to properly address errors.\" The Haunted Mine Drop is currently closed, and future plans for the ride are \"undetermined,\" the amusement park said. \"Safety is, and always has been, our top priority,\" Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park founder Steve Beckley said in a statement following the release of the report. \"Since opening our first ride just over 15 years ago, Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park has delivered more than 10 million safe and enjoyable rides.\" \"We have been working closely with the Colorado Division of Oil and Public Safety and independent safety experts to review this incident,\" he continued, noting that the amusement park will review the report \"carefully for recommendations.\" \"More than anything, we want the Estifanos family to know how deeply sorry we are for their loss and how committed we are to making sure it never happens again,\" he added. In a statement to Denver ABC affiliate KMGH, Dan Caplis, an attorney for the Estifanos family, said that Wongel\\'s parents had received the report and called on people who have \"experienced problems\" with the Haunted Mine Drop to come forward. \"Wongel\\'s parents are determined to do everything in their power to make sure that no one ever dies this way again,\" said Caplis, who told the station he intends to file a lawsuit against the park on behalf of the family. ABC News\\' Will McDuffie contributed to this report.\\nAt least three people were killed and multiple others were injured when an Amtrak train derailed in remote northern Montana on Saturday, sending several cars toppling over, authorities said. Eight cars on the train, Empire Builder 7/27, which was headed from Chicago to Seattle, derailed just before 4 p.m. local time near Joplin, Montana, according to Amtrak. The rail line confirmed there were injuries to passengers and crew members, but offered no more details. The three deaths were confirmed by the Liberty County Sheriff\\'s Department, and Hill County\\'s disaster and emergency services coordinator, Amanda Frickel, confirmed to ABC news Sunday that there were \"upwards of 50 injuries.\" Frickel said the injuries ranged \"from minor cuts and bruises, sprains, to a couple head wounds and critical.\" On Sunday, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte said five people remain hospitalized in stable condition. There were 146 passengers and 13 crew members on the train, Sarah Robbin, the disaster and emergency services coordinator for Liberty County, said at a news conference Sunday. She said multiple people were taken to area hospitals, where most were treated and released. All of the train passengers have been accounted for, according to the governor. With the exception of those who are in the hospital, all of the passengers have been transported out of the area, Gianforte said. On Sunday evening, Becca Schneider, the wife of Zach Schneider, confirmed to ABC News that Zach was one of those killed in the Amtrak derailment. \"Zach Schneider was a kind, compassionate and patient man. He was an incredible husband, software developer, debate coach and friend,\" she said. \"He loved board games, bonfires, the Packers and a good slice of Chicago-style pizza. He was fiercely loved by his wife, family, friends and pets, and will be dearly missed.\" \"We are in mourning today for the people who lost their lives due to the derailment of the Empire Builder train Saturday, near Joplin, Montana, on the BNSF Railway, as well as the many others who were injured. We have no words that can adequately express our sorrow for those who lost a loved one or who were hurt in this horrible event. They are in our thoughts and prayers,\" Amtrak CEO Bill Flynn said Sunday. Several passengers shared images of the front cars off the track, with some tipped on their sides. One passenger, Megan Vandervest, told ABC News in a telephone interview early Sunday that she was taking a nap in a sleeper car near the front of the train when she was jolted awake. \"I woke up to the train derailing. It was very bumpy, like extreme turbulence and very loud noises, and it kind of smelled of smoke,\" Vandervest said. \"And so my first thought was that we were derailing. And then I thought that was crazy. There was no way that we could possibly be derailing. That\\'s insane.\" She said the train slowly came to a stop, and she initially thought they had gone over a stretch of \"bumpy track.\" \"Then we kind of looked out our car, and you could see that one of the cars, the car behind us, had been tilted so that (you) couldn\\'t see down the hallway anymore,\" Vandervest said. She said she and other passengers were evacuated within 10 minutes of the derailment. \"It wasn\\'t until you really got out of the train fully that we knew the extent of what had happened. It was definitely like an incredible shock,\" Vandervest said. She described a \"chaotic\" scene outside the train as passengers emerged from tipped-over cars dazed, confused and injured. She said one of the toppled cars was the observation car. \"The people who had been in some of the tipped-over cars that had gotten out were definitely just in shock and sitting there, and the rest of us were kind of just waiting for what would happen,\" Vandervest said. She said passengers were taken by bus to a senior center in a nearby town, where she was able to call a cousin who lives in Montana to come and pick her up. Vandervest said she spoke to passengers who were in the tipped-over cars and they described holding on for life. \"They held on really tightly. And others were less fortunate for the positions that they were. If they were by windows, it was more dangerous,\" she said. \"One passenger I talked to, he had kind of gotten out of the observation car that had been completely tipped over that he was in and that there was another passenger outside that asked him to go back and check for someone else. He went back in and, unfortunately, they were pretty badly injured.\" The section of track where the accident occurred was last inspected on Sept. 23rd -- just last week -- as part of a regular BNSF inspection, Gianforte said. It was not immediately clear what caused the derailment. Amtrak said in a statement that anyone with questions about friends or family who were traveling on the train can call (800) 523-9101. They said they are fully cooperating with the investigation, working closely with National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Railroad Administration, local law enforcement and response agencies. \"We share the sense of urgency to understand why the accident happened; however, until the investigation is complete, we will not comment further on the accident itself. The NTSB will identify the cause or causes of this accident, and Amtrak commits to taking appropriate actions to prevent a similar accident in the future,\" Flynn, the company\\'s CEO, said. He added that Amtrak\\'s focus is on \"doing everything we can to help our passengers and crew, especially the families of those who were injured or died, at this painful and difficult time.\" Their Incident Response Team has been initiated and they have sent emergency personnel and Amtrak leadership to the scene to help the passengers, employees and families affected. \"We have dispatched nurse case managers to support those hospitalized,\" Flynn said. \"As soon as Amtrak has permission, we will access the accident site to retrieve the personal effects of our passengers and crew.\" Amtrak Sunday also thanked first responders, hospital staff and law enforcement for their immediate and ongoing help to support those aboard the Empire Builder. The National Transportation Safety Board deployed investigators to the site Sunday evening and they are expected to stay on the scene for at least a week, according to a statement from the agency. The Federal Railroad Administration also sent an 18-member team to the crash scene to help in the investigation. \"Our number one focus is safety, and we are committed to taking all steps necessary to prevent a similar event from occurring again,\" Amit Bose, deputy administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, said in a statement. Liberty County is an extremely rural part of northern Montana, with only a few thousand residents, despite being larger than the entire state of Rhode Island. Great Falls is the largest nearby city, about 100 miles south of Joplin. The state capital of Helena is about three hours south of Joplin by car.

The FBI is investigating after a female U.S. service member reported she was assaulted by a group of male Afghan evacuees at Fort Bliss in New Mexico. The woman, who was helping to support the evacuees brought from Afghanistan to the United States in the wake of the Taliban reclaiming the country, reported she was assaulted by a small group at the Dona Ana Complex on Sept. 19, according to Lt. Col. Allie M. Payne, the director of public affairs for Fort Bliss. \"We take the allegation seriously and appropriately referred the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" Payne said in a statement. \"The safety and well-being of our service members, as well as all of those on our installations, is paramount. We immediately provided appropriate care, counseling and support to the service member.\" The base also said it is adding security measures, like increased lighting, safety patrols and enforcing a buddy system. \"We received the referral from Fort Bliss and our office is investigating the allegation,\" FBI El Paso said in a statement. There were no further details about the incident. The Dona Ana Complex, which is about a half hour north of Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, across the New Mexico border, is used as a firing range, but was converted into a sprawling, air conditioned tent city for incoming evacuees. The Biden administration chose Fort Bliss two weeks ago when it granted access to the media to one of the facilities housing the tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees who were flown out of Kabul in a frenzied, chaotic process prompted by the Taliban reasserting control of the country much sooner than anticipated. About 10,000 evacuees are staying at the facility until they can be processed and resettled, according to U.S. officials. All of the evacuees were subject to a thorough vetting process before they were flown to the U.S., according to U.S. officials. News of the investigation of the assault on a female service member follows the arrests of two Afghan evacuees at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin this week. Mohammad Haroon Imaad, 32, was charged with strangling and suffocating his wife in an incident that took place Sept. 7, according to the indictment, and Bahrullah Noori, 20, was charged with attempting to engage in a sexual act with a minor. Court documents say 13,000 people related to the resettlement are being housed at Fort McCoy.\\nWe cant wait to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World Resort, which starts next week on Oct. 1! And now, were excited for air travelers at the Orlando International Airport to feel immersed in the magic as soon as they arrive in Central Florida, after a magical transformation of the passenger arrival experience. This transformation of exciting Disney touches includes a wide-spanning art installation in the terminal train stations featuring the Disney Fab 50 Character Collection, found throughout all four Walt Disney World theme parks, as well as a photo opportunity with a golden teacup inspired by the famous Mad Tea Party attraction at Magic Kingdom Park, and a glistening glow of projected EARidescent light patterns engaging passengers as they walk through the airport terminal just outside the Magic of Disney Store in the East Hall. Here guests will also pass a 36-foot long video screen showcasing the shimmering EARidescence of the four parks \"Beacons of Magic.\" This magical makeover has arrived at Floridas busiest airport just in time for the start of \"The Worlds Most Magical Celebration\" at Walt Disney World Resort and will stick around through March 2022. Whether flying into Orlando at the beginning, middle or end of our 18-month 50th Anniversary celebration, we cant wait to share this magical milestone!\\nCast are the heart of the magic at Walt Disney World Resort, and we were thrilled to celebrate a longtime cast member family who has shared their love for and dedication to Disney with their daughter, Kaylin, an elite runner who fulfilled her dream of winning Gold and Bronze medals in track and field at the Olympic Games in Tokyo! Kaylin Whitney and her parents, DuWayne Whitney and Kerrie Dworetsky, were able to celebrate together for the first time since Kaylin arrived home from the games, and they spent the day with extended family and friends celebrating at EPCOT, a special place where Kerrie has worked for the past 15 years. The day was filled with a number of surprises, including a special moment for family and friends to cheer on Kaylin as she \"crossed the finish line\" to arrive in the France pavilion that morning. With spectators not able to travel to Tokyo this summer, it was a moment that Kaylins friends and family had been waiting for. Joined by Jeff Vahle, President, Walt Disney World Resort, Thomas Mazloum, President, Disney Signature Experiences, Kartika Rodriguez, Vice President, EPCOT, and the 2022-2023 Walt Disney World Disney Ambassadors, the group cheered with excitement as Kaylin rounded the corner into the France pavilion. After snapping many celebratory photos, the family was able to enjoy the parks together, and even got to experience a \"squeak peek\" of Remys Ratatouille Adventure, opening Oct. 1 in the France pavilion at EPCOT. Running must \"run\" in the family, as her dad, DuWayne, a 25-year cast member who works at Disney Vacation Club, ran track in high school and at the University of Arkansas, inspiring Kaylin to run. Now Kaylin is enjoying traveling around the world while doing what she loves--she said its the best job in the world! We may need to challenge her on that because her mom says she loves Disney so much and hopes to celebrate her 50-year anniversary at Walt Disney World one day! You can certainly \"track\" Disney in this family as Kaylins grandparents both worked at Disney, making it a total of 87 years of family employment at Walt Disney World. Kaylin couldnt wait to come home to go to Disney, and we were so happy to welcome her and her family for this special celebration.\\n\"You can do really anything to raise money for cancer. Anything in the world. You just have to do something. So get after it!\" That was the message from Walker Beery (age 9) to kids all across the country, rallying them to get involved in the fight against pediatric cancer - a fight Walker knew all too well. Drawing from their sons fight and spirit, our next Disney Magic Makers have dedicated their lives to raising awareness and funds for pediatric cancer research after Walker was diagnosed in 2017.

Born in New Orleans, Walker loved sports, Mardi Gras and his friends & family with a zest for life. At age 7 he was unexpectedly diagnosed with brain cancer and passed on in Sept. 2021. While in the hospital for treatment, Walker told his parents he wanted to inspire other kids to help fight pediatric cancer. The group \"Kids Join The Fight\" was born from this act of kindness and has kicked off a grassroots movement of kids and families around the country. Fun runs, lemonade stands, bracelet sales and football clinics have popped up in all 50 states this year raising over $400,000 (with a goal of at least $1,000,000 by the end of the year) and critical awareness for pediatric cancer research.

A few days after returning to Florida in mid-March 1998 for a Disney professional internship, I attended a special cast member preview of the then newest park at Walt Disney World Resort, just a few weeks prior to its grand opening. As we approach the start of the Walt Disney World 50th anniversary celebration on Oct. 1, Im sharing images I captured from that memorable trip. During a June 1995 press conference, Disney officials announced the park by revealing a magnificent Tree of Life model flanked by concept art of dinosaurs and a safari vehicle. Construction began two months later, with eventually over 4 million cubic yards of dirt being moved to build this lush botanical paradise. The park, wrote Melody Mamberg in \"The Making of Disneys Animal Kingdom Theme Park,\" would be based on \"enduring love for animals and celebrate all animals that ever or never existed.\" For me, it was a photographers playground as I took hundreds of images that spring. During the preview, I picked up the special edition Adventurers Guide, only to return a few weeks later on April 22, 1998, for an opening day guide map. Guests visiting Disneys Animal Kingdom would soon discover more than 4 million trees, plants, shrubs, and vines; and about 2,000 animals, representing 300 species. My favorite attraction on first impression was Kilimanjaro Safaris, as every journey through Harambe Wildlife Reserves savanna made me feel like I was in the heart of Africa. In all, the attraction encompasses about 100 acres of the 500-acre park. I also frequented Gorilla Falls Exploration Trail, spending countless minutes photographing several beautiful gorillas. It remains a beloved place today, especially following the recent birth of a western lowland gorilla named Ada! Her name comes from the Igbo people in Nigeria and can be translated to mean \"first daughter.\" Besides my animal encounters, I enjoyed seeing the \"March of the ARTimals\" held daily from April 1998 through June 1999. This spontaneous carnival around what we call Discovery Island today featured brightly colored animal costumes and floats designed by Swiss artist Rolf Knie. The best part about Disneys Animal Kingdom has been watching the park evolve during the past 23 years. Those millions of trees, shrubs and vines planted decades ago have since blossomed, and with the addition of Pandora - The World of Avatar, the park is now a spectacular day-to-night experience. I cant wait to photograph the Tree of Life once again during the 50th anniversary celebration, when it transforms into a Beacon of Magic at night. Its going to sparkle with the light of enchanted fireflies calling forth the magic of nature, adding what is sure to be yet another memorable moment from Disneys Animal Kingdom. Be sure to keep following along here on the Disney Parks Blog and #DisneyWorld50 on social platforms as we continue to chronicle this amazing time in our history.\\n\"When my name was called, I thought I was dreaming.

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index surged 19.9% in July compared with a year ago, the largest gain on records dating back to 2000. In 17 of the 20 cities, prices rose more quickly in July than in June. And prices reached all-time highs in 19 of 20 cities. The one exception was Chicago, where prices are just 0.3% below their 2006 peak. Sales of new and existing homes have jumped this year, driven by low mortgage rates and a desire for more living space during the pandemic. Sales of existing homes are up 16% in the first eight months of 2021 compared with last year, and they\\'re up 12% from the same period in 2019. Phoenix, San Diego, and Seattle reported the biggest price increases, with Phoenix leading the nation for the 26th straight month.\\nIn their first appearance before Congress since the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Afghanistan, the nation\\'s top military leaders candidly admitted to lawmakers that they had recommended to President Joe Biden that the U.S. should keep a troop presence there, appearing to contradict his assertions. The testimony by Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command, was at odds with Biden\\'s comments earlier this year to ABC News\\' George Stephanopoulos that his military commanders did not recommend keeping a residual force. The revelations came during a six-hour hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee where Milley also characterized that the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan had been \"a strategic failure\" and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin acknowledged that it was time to acknowledged some \"uncomfortable truths\" about the two decade U.S. military mission in Afghanistan. Here are some key takeaways: Military commanders wanted to keep at least 2,500 troops in Afghanistan While Milley and McKenzie said they would not disclose the content of private conversations with Biden, both generals offered their personal opinions that they said matched their recommendations. \"My assessment was back in the fall of \\'20 and remained consistent throughout that we should keep a steady state of 2,500, could bounce up to 3,500,\" Milley told Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas. \"I recommended that we maintain 2,500 troops in Afghanistan, and I also recommended early in the fall of 2020 that we maintain 4,500 at that time, those were my personal views,\" McKenzie said. The generals\\' statements were at odds with what Biden had told ABC\\'s George Stephanopoulos in an interview on Aug. 18. \"No one told -- your military advisers did not tell you, \"No, we should just keep 2,500 troops. It\\'s been a stable situation for the last several years. We can do that. We can continue to do that?,\" Stephanopoulos asked Biden. \"No,\" said Biden. \"No one said that to me, that I can recall.\" Biden also said his military advisers were \"split\" on the matter. McKenzie said he had also warned that the withdrawal of U.S. troops \"would lead inevitably to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Afghan military.\" \"I also had a view that the withdrawal of those forces would lead inevitably to the collapse of the Afghan military forces and eventually the Afghan government,\" he said. \\'A strategic failure\\' Austin and Milley told senators that the sudden collapse of the Afghan government, as well as the U.S. military\\'s mission in Afghanistan over the past two decades, should be examined to learn what may have gone wrong. Milley became the first U.S. military leader to describe the American military mission in Afghanistan as \"a strategic failure\" that had developed over time. \"Outcomes in a war like this, an outcome that is a strategic failure -- the enemy is in charge in Kabul, theres no way else to describe that -- that is a cumulative effect of 20 years,\" Milley said. The general speculated that the U.S. had trained an Afghan Army that \"mirrored\" the American military without taking into account local and cultural traditions and allowed it to becoe too dependent on American technology. \"We helped build a state, but we could not forge a nation,\" said Austin. \"The fact that the Afghan army, we and our partners trained, simply melted away - in many cases without firing a shot - took us all by surprise. It would be dishonest to claim otherwise.\" \"We need to consider some uncomfortable truths,\" he added. \"That we did not fully comprehend the depth of corruption and poor leadership in their senior ranks, that we did not grasp the damaging effect of frequent and unexplained rotations by President Ghani of his commanders, that we did not anticipate the snowball effect caused by the deals that Taliban commanders struck with local leaders in the wake of the Doha agreement, that the Doha agreement itself had a demoralizing effect on Afghan soldiers, and that we failed to fully grasp that there was only so much for which - and for whom - many of the Afghan forces would fight. We provided the Afghan military with equipment and aircraft and the skills to use them.\" \"Over the years, they often fought bravely,\" said Austin. \"Tens of thousands of Afghan soldiers and police officers died. But in the end, we couldnt provide them with the will to win. At least not all of them.\" US intelligence did not predict the Taliban\\'s swift takeover, the generals said The three leaders expressed surprise at how Afghan forces had quickly fallen apart leading to a Taliban takeover of the country in 11 days. \"I did not foresee it to be days. I thought it could take months,\" said McKenzie, who added that he had anticipated that the Afghan military would be able to hold out against the Taliban until later this year and possibly into early next year. \"We certainly did not plan against a collapse of the government in 11 days,\" Austin said. \"There\\'s no intel assessment that says the government is going to collapse and the military is going to collapse in 11 days that I\\'m aware of. And I\\'ve read I think all of them,\" said Milley, who later described the failure to predict the scope and scale of the Taliban takeover as \"a swing and a miss.\" Revelations in \\'the book\\' In his opening statement, Milley explained how his two phone calls to his counterpart in China, first described in the book \"Peril\" by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, were authorized by then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Milley also said that the Trump national security team was fully briefed on the calls that were intended to reassure China that then-President Donald Trump was not planning a military attack. \"I know, I am certain, that President Trump did not intend to attack the Chinese, and it is my directed responsibility and it was my directed responsibility by the secretary, to convey that intent to the Chinese,\" Milley said. \"My task at that time was to de-escalate my message again was consistent, stay calm, steady and de-escalate. We are not going to attack you.\" He pushed back on another story in the book that, in a phone call with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, he agreed with her assessment that Trump was \"crazy.\" \"Im not qualified to evaluate the mental fitness or the health of a former president, present president or anybody else or anybody in this room,\" Milley said. \"Thats not my job. Thats not what I do. And thats not what I did.\" Several Republican senators took Milley to task for giving access to reporters and authors. \"I think what you did with making time to talk to these authors, burnishing your image, kind of building that bluster, but then not putting the focus on Afghanistan and what was happening there,\" said Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. \"General Milley, this is disappointing to me. I know it\\'s disappointing to people that have served with you or under you, under your command. It does not serve our nation.\" \"Youre doing these interviews and doing them in 2021. Makes me wonder the books, were you a little distracted about what was going on in Afghanistan?\" said GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri who then demanded that Austin and Milley should resign.\\nAfter a judge dismissed some of the biggest unsettled lawsuits against Ohio State over decades-old sexual abuse by a long-dead team doctor, plaintiffs say they\\'ll keep pressing their cases against the university via appeals COLUMBUS, Ohio -- After a judge recently dismissed some of the biggest unsettled lawsuits against Ohio State over decades-old sexual abuse by a long-dead team doctor, Steve Snyder-Hill heard a familiar voice questioning why he and other alumni keep pressing their cases against the university. Even his own mother wondered if it was just about seeking more compensation, he said. He assured her that at least for him, it\\'s not about the money. He and some of the other men planning to further appeal their cases say what they\\'re after is less tangible. Snyder-Hill wants bigger changes in how sexual misconduct is handled. Dan Ritchie wants an outcome that doesn\\'t block the survivors from criticizing how Ohio State responded as accusations became public over the past few years. Mike Schyck wants an ending that forces the university to acknowledge more specific responsibility for what went wrong, beyond the broader public apologies it has made for failing to stop Dr. Richard Strauss, even though students had raised concerns. \"They prop you up and say: Thank you for your bravery, and were sorry this has happened, you know, but sorry, not sorry,\" said Schyck, a former wrestler. Ohio State officials contend the university took the allegations seriously, had a law firm investigate, responded with transparency and empathy, made changes to prevent and address sexual misconduct, and tried to do the right thing through settlement offers. The university reached nearly $47 million in settlements with 185 survivors -- an average of about $252,000 -- and then offered certain remaining plaintiffs an individual settlement program with average payouts limited to that same amount. In all, Ohio State said it settled with more than 230 men. The total sum hasn\\'t been disclosed. Former hockey player Roger Beedon felt the offers \"just didnt add up\" for him and some of the other plaintiffs in light of what they experienced. Many of the accusers said they were fondled in required medical exams at campus athletic facilities throughout his two decades at Ohio State, or at a student health center, the doctors home or his off-campus clinic. Some said they were raped. U.S. District Judge Michael Watson last week dismissed the bulk of the unsettled cases, involving more than 200 plaintiffs. He concluded that though university officials turned a blind eye to Strauss\\' abuse of hundreds of young men, the legal time limit for the claims had passed. Cases filed even more recently, involving dozens of plaintiffs, are still pending. Ohio State has argued those should be dismissed, too. Attorney Richard Schulte said he has over 50 clients in that group who didn\\'t get to mediate their cases or participate in the individual settlement program. \"Ohio State has decided for whatever reason to exclude all these survivors and deny them any accountability whatsoever,\" Schulte said. Attorneys for many of the men who came forward with claims have argued most didnt recognize their experiences as abuse or understand Ohio State\\'s role in enabling it until after accusations about Strauss first became public in 2018. A statement from lawyers representing Snyder-Hill and more than 100 others said Watsons ruling \"sends a disturbing message that the very real challenges sexual abuse survivors often face in understanding what has happened to them - and who enabled the abuse they experienced - is irrelevant when they ultimately ask for the courts help in holding abusive people and institutions accountable.\" Beedon said it\\'s also been frustrating and hurtful to see social media users and other critics questioning survivors\\' motives as they continue litigation. \"I don\\'t know if they understand fully the pain and the counseling and the anger and how we dealt with this and how this has affected our personal lives even to this day,\" Beedon said. Ritchie, a former wrestler who graduated in 1994, said it\\'s been grueling to have memories and impacts dragged to the fore and into the headlines again and again. But he said he wouldn\\'t accept settlement terms that prohibit disparaging how Ohio State has handled the allegations over the past three years. \"I want this to end, but not like this,\" he said. Schyck worries the judge\\'s decision about the Ohio State matter will discourage survivors of long-ago abuse from coming forward or speaking up elsewhere, such as in a similar case at the University of Michigan. But Schyck says he\\'s undeterred. \"Im not going anywhere,\" he said. \"Weve waited 3 1/2 years. If we have to keep going, well keep going.\"\\nPyongyang has test-launched missiles six times this year so far. SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired a short-range missile toward the Sea of Japan early Tuesday, according to its neighboring countries, South Korea and Japan, marking the third such weapons test this month. Military officials in Seoul, Tokyo and Washington, D.C. were investigating whether the latest missile was ballistic and if it was launched from a submarine. A ballistic missile launch would violate United Nations Security Council resolutions that ban North Korea from engaging in any ballistic activities, though the council typically doesn\\'t slap new sanctions on Pyongyang for testing short-range weapons. \"The missile was fired from the North\\'s Mupyong-ri in Jagang Province eastward at around 6:40 a.m,\" South Korea\\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters on Tuesday. \"South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities are analyzing the launch for additional information.\" There was \"no report of damage to Japan\\'s aircraft or sea vessels,\" according to Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato. \"North Korea\\'s missile launches pose a serious threat to the safety of our nation and the stability of the region,\" Kato said during a press conference on Tuesday morning. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Tuesday that his \"government is on high alert and monitoring the situation.\" North Korea has test-launched missiles six times in 2021 so far, three of which occurred this month. North Korean state media claimed that Pyongyang had successfully tested a long-range cruise missile on Sept. 12 and fired two short-range ballistic missiles off the eastern coast three days later. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State condemned the latest weapons test, calling it a \"violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions\" -- a tacit acknowledgment that the United States believes the missile was in fact ballistic. \"We remain committed to a diplomatic approach to the DPRK and call on them to engage in dialogue,\" the spokesperson told ABC News in a statement early Tuesday, using the acronym for North Korea\\'s official name, the Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea. During a press briefing on Monday, State Department deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter told reporters that the U.S. government is \"prepared to meet with the DPRK without preconditions, and we certainly hope that the DPRK will respond positively to our outreach.\" Tuesday\\'s missile launch happened an hour after North Korea\\'s ambassador to the U.N., Kim Song, delivered remarks at the 76th session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York City, during which he attempted to justify his country\\'s development of a \"war deterrent\" to defend against threats from the U.S. and other rivals. \"What we mean by the war deterrent is literally the righteous right to self-defense that can deter aggressive war and defend ourselves,\" Kim said. \"The possible outbreak of a new war on the Korean Peninsula is contained not because of the U.S.\\'s mercy on the DPRK, it is because our state is growing a reliable deterrent that can control the hostile forces in an attempted military invasion.\" Moon Sung-muk, an analyst and arms control expert at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, an independent, not-for-profit think tank in Seoul, said Kim\\'s speech was asking the international community to acknowledge North Korea\\'s weapons development as inside legal boundaries. \"North Korea is deliberately offering a condition that the U.S. and South Korea cannot accept so that when negotiations fall apart, they can blame their counterparts,\" Moon told ABC News on Tuesday. \"As preconditions to resume inter-Korean talks, North Korea told South Korea in a statement last Saturday to consider their missile development as a reasonable act of self deterrence.\" North Korea has been sending mixed messages this year. While test-firing a variety of missiles, Kim Yo Jong, the politically powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has hinted that Pyongyang is ready to engage in talks with South Korea and formally declare an end to the Korean War. \"South Korea must not try to upset the balance of military force on the Korean Peninsula with such illogical and childish absurd assertion just as the U.S. does,\" she was quoted as saying on Saturday by North Korean state media. \"I only hope that the South Korean authorities\\' moves to remove the tinderbox holding double standards bereft of impartiality, the hostile policy toward the DPRK.\" But Cha Du-hyeogn, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, an independent, non-profit think tank in Seoul, doubted Pyongyang\\'s will to come back to the negotiation table. \"North Korea never said they are willing to resume talks without conditions,\" Cha told ABC News on Tuesday. \"The consecutive statements followed by missile provocations can be seen as a double-sided strategy.\" Cha added that Kim Yo Jong is pushing South Korea to convince the U.S. to lift sanctions if the South is so eager to resume dialogue. \"It\\'s an attempt to incapacitate the U.S.-South Korea cooperation by making use of national, or inter-Korean, cooperation,\" he said. Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said Pyongyang \"is not only testing its missile but also the South Korean government.\" \"Pyongyang will wait to see what South Korea has to say about the missile experiment,\" Yang told ABC News on Tuesday, \"after Kim Yo Jong insisted that South Korea get rid of the double standards on North\\'s weapons tests if they want inter-Korean dialogue.\" ABC News\\' Conor Finnegan, Shihoo Lee, Chae Young Oh and Anthony Trotter contributed to this report.

That\\'s because the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, the CDC, looked at all the data, completed their review, and determined the boosters for the Pfizer vaccine -- others will come later, maybe, I assume -- but the Pfizer vaccine are safe and effective,\" Biden began at an early afternoon event. Delivering remarks ahead of receiving a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the South Court Auditorium, Biden took the opportunity to address some of that confusion. He joked, \"Now I know it doesn\\'t look like it, but I am over 65 -- I wish -- I\\'m way over. And that\\'s why I\\'m getting my booster shot today.\" The president received his first dose of the vaccine on Dec. 21, 2020, and his second dose on Jan. 11, 2021. At 78, Biden qualifies for a third shot under the new CDC guidance issued last week recommending booster shots to Americans 65 and older at least six months after their first series of shots. Additionally, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky overruled her agency\\'s independent advisory panel last Friday by adding a recommendation for a third dose for Americans ages 18 to 64 considered high risk to COVID-19 due to where they work. Biden repeated the administration\\'s messaging that while booster shots are rolling out, baseline vaccinations are the priority. \"The bottom line is that you\\'re fully vaccinated, and you\\'re highly protected now from severe illness, even if you get COVID-19. You\\'re safe and we\\'re going to do everything we can to keep it that way, with the boosters. But let me be clear, boosters are important, but the most important thing we need to do is get more people vaccinated,\" he said. \"The vast majority of Americans are doing the right thing. Over 77% of adults have gotten at least one shot. About 23% haven\\'t gotten any shots. And that, that distinct minority is causing an awful lot of us, a lot of damage for the rest of the country,\" he added. \"This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. That\\'s why I\\'m moving forward with vaccination requirements wherever I can,\" Biden said. As Biden walked over to receive his shot, he did a double-take, walking back to the podium to put his mask back on, in apparent modeling of CDC recommendations, before he sat, rolled up his sleeve and a military medical professional administered the shot. Underscoring how easy it is to get the vaccine, Biden talked the entire time he received his, fielding questions from reporters. \"We are helping -- we are more than every other nation in the world combined,\" he said, confronted with the World Health Organization\\'s opposition to booster shots before some in poorer nations get their first doses. \"We\\'re gonna do our part.\" Asked about the upcoming week on Capitol Hill, Biden told reporters, \"We\\'ve got three things to do: The debt ceiling, the continuing resolution and the two pieces of legislation. If we do that, the country is going to be in great shape.\" The president, standing up and replacing his suit jacket, answered a question from a White House reporter on how many people need to be vaccinated to go back to normal. \"One thing\\'s for certain. A quarter of the country cannot go unvaccinated and us not continue to have a problem,\" Biden said, though he deferred to scientists on the actual numbers. White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked following Biden\\'s booster if a graphic provided by the White House on booster eligibility illustrated a concern that back-and-forth guidance from the CDC has left people confused about the booster, and perhaps, more doubtful about the vaccine altogether. \"Well, I would say the reason we did this chart is that sometimes it\\'s self-perpetuating. If everybody here is saying it\\'s confusing, then people are going to think it\\'s confusing. And so what I\\'m trying to do is alleviate the confusion, right?\" she said. \"We want to do everything we can to alleviate any confusion, answer questions people have. The president went and got his shot his booster shot on camera to make clear it\\'s safe, it\\'s effective. It\\'s something you should do if you\\'re in one of these categories,\" she added. On ABC\\'s \"Good Morning America\" on Monday, Walensky acknowledged the confusion around the decision and the categories of people it applies to as the administration promotes the rollout of booster shots. Asked also on CBS about Biden\\'s comment last week that boosters could be offered to the general population anyway, despite the more narrow recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration and CDC, Walensky said, \"I recognize that confusion.\" \"Right now, our recommendation is for these limited people in the population, over 65, high-risk workers, high-risk community occupations, as well as high-risk by comorbidities,\" she said. On when the general population will be eligible, Walensky said it\\'s being looked at every few weeks but did not offer the same optimism as the president had last week. \"We are evaluating this science in real-time. We are meeting every several weeks now to evaluate the science. The science may very well show that the rest of the population needs to be boosted. And we will provide those guidances as soon as we have the science to inform them,\" she said. The new CDC current policy does not apply for boosters to be given to people initially vaccinated with the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson shots.

Getting those cases swiftly to trial is turning out to be an even more difficult task. Investigators have collected a mountain of evidence in the attack and are working to organize it and share it with defense attorneys. And that mountain keeps growing with new arrests still happening practically every week. Washington\\'s federal court, meanwhile, is clogged with Jan. 6 cases, which more than double the total number of new criminal cases filed there all of last year. Further complicating things are limitations the court has put on trials because of the coronavirus pandemic. The court delays are dragging out a process already called into question by some right-wing lawmakers, who argue its a waste of time and money to prosecute people accused of low-level crimes. As the court cases continue to stall, so do answers to what happened that day and the possibility for consequences from the most violent assault at the Capitol in a generation. Meanwhile, Democrats in the House are subpoenaing former President Donald Trump\\'s aides and have requested a trove of documents as a select committee also probes the insurrection. While it\\'s not unusual for federal cases to take a year or more to work through the system, some defense lawyers and judges are raising concerns that defendants with a right to a speedy trial may end up waiting a long time before getting their day in court. \"The reason for the delay has not changed or become even remotely concrete. It remains as amorphous today as it was months ago,\" an attorney wrote in court documents opposing prosecutors\\' request to cancel the scheduled November trial for Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, an ex-Army reservist described by co-workers as a known Nazi sympathizer. So far, only about 80 cases have been resolved by guilty pleas -- largely by those who were charged only with misdemeanor offenses. Scores of others face serious felony charges including conspiracy, assaulting officers and obstructing of an official proceeding that call for lengthy sentences behind bars. The Justice Department has called it the largest investigation in American history, with probes open in 55 out of 56 FBI field offices. Evidence collected in the attack includes thousands of hours of video footage, hundreds of thousands of tips from the public and more than 1 million Parler posts, replies and data. The Justice Department is building massive databases to share all evidence stemming from the attack with defense attorneys. In the most high-profile case brought so far, involving more than a dozen members and associates of the far-right extremist group the Oath Keepers, prosecutors recently told a judge that a January trial date for the first set of defendants is looking increasingly unrealistic given how much evidence they still need to get into defense attorneys\\' hands. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said if they have to wait until prosecutors turn over \"every single scrap of evidence\" they\\'ve collected in the Jan. 6 investigation -- rather than just that which relates to a specific defendant -- there won\\'t be trials in any of these cases before 2023. And three of the Oath Keepers defendants, accused of conspiring to block the certification of Joe Biden\\'s presidential election victory over Trump, are behind bars. \"I have to keep their interests in a speedy trial in mind here,\" Mehta said. \"I am concerned about a lengthy pretrial detention period,\" he added. He didn\\'t immediately rule but signaled that the first Oath Keepers trial would likely be pushed to April, with the second scheduled for July. At least one of those roughly 70 defendants who are locked up pretrial has already pointed to the delays in an effort to get out of jail. Kelly Meggs, described by authorities as the leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers, said in an unsuccessful motion for release that with a January trial looking unlikely, he\\'s effectively being held in \"indefinite pre-trial detention which, under the circumstances, is tantamount to a human rights violation.\" Prosecutors say they are working as quickly as possible under unprecedented challenges to share all evidence that could potentially help the defense and keep the cases moving forward. But new evidence is still being unearthed with each new arrest or as analysis is completed on the thousands of hours of video taken during that chaotic day. In the case of Robert Reeder, armchair detectives who call themselves Sedition Hunters unearthed new evidence just before he was supposed to be sentenced last month with a recommendation of probation. The video appears to shows Reeder scuffling with a police officer, running counter to his assertion that he had not been part of any violence that day. Reeder\\'s attorney called the clip problematic. A new sentencing is set for Oct. 8. The coronavirus is only making matters worse. Cases were already backed up because of the pandemic, and the court has said no more than three trials can be held at once at least until the end of October to allow for social distancing. A judge in one case recently warned attorneys there\\'s no guarantee they will be going to trial as planned in February if COVID-19 numbers tick up. The pandemic has also made it harder for defendants held behind bars to safely work with their lawyers -- a problem that\\'s plagued the entire criminal justice system. \"The defense attorneys just arent really able to consistently meet with their clients, arent able to consistently share data or prepare defense with them in an engaged, consistent way,\" said Jon Lewis, a research fellow whos been following the Jan. 6 cases for the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. \"Its a very real issue.\" Some defendants, like Hale-Cusanelli, say they don\\'t want to wait any longer for their chance to defend themselves in court. Hale-Cusanelli is scheduled for trial on Nov. 9, but prosecutors say there\\'s no way that\\'s possible. A judge has set a hearing for next week to decide whether to keep that date in place. A lawyer for the former Army reservist accused prosecutors of seeking more time only to \"further cement their case\" against his client, \"despite having allegedly sufficient evidence to indict\" him. Prosecutors called that assertion \"wholly without foundation.\" \"The government has presented eminently reasonable explanations for the delay: its strenuous efforts to meet the challenges imposed by the enormous amount of relevant evidence that it must review, process, categorize, and organize into a format that will make it accessible and useful to the defense,\" they wrote in court documents. Prosecutors say Hale-Cusanelli, who worked as a security contractor at a Navy base, used his military training to avoid the effects of pepper spray and tactical hand signals to urge fellow rioters forward on Jan. 6. He later described the day as exhilarating to a tipster, praising the \"the adrenaline, the rush, the purpose\" he felt, according to court documents. Hale-Cusanelli\\'s attorney has noted that he is not accused of hurting anyone that day. The defense has called him an \"opinionated individual\" who \"fully exercised his right to speak freely before being imprisoned.\" ------ Richer reported from Boston, and Whitehurst reported from Salt Lake City.\\nKarla Rodriguez moved her family from El Salvador to Los Angeles five months ago to give her kids a better education and a better life. Her 8-year-old son has Down syndrome. Someone at his new school recommended she reach out to a nonprofit health advocacy group, Community Health Councils, to help with his special care. Among other support and guidance, the organization helped the Rodriguez family get health insurance. \"We are immigrants, and perhaps we don\\'t have rights that citizens do,\" Rodriguez told Los Angeles ABC station KABC in Spanish, adding that she\\'s grateful that California is welcoming to families like hers. \"This is a huge privilege, a blessing, for our family to be able to count on something so vital, such as health care and access to it.\" But access to health insurance is a luxury not available to millions of Hispanic or Latino people across the United States. In the 100 largest U.S. cities, white people are more likely to have health insurance than people of color -- and the largest gaps in most communities is experienced by Latino or Hispanic families. The health insurance access gap is just one of many findings about the widespread inequity people of color experience in their day-to-day lives in America\\'s biggest cities, according to a sweeping data analysis by ABC-owned television stations. In the report, released Tuesday, the stations\\' data journalists measured equity in 20 quality-of-life areas across five categories -- health, education, policing, housing and wealth, and the environment -- using the latest data available from local, state and federal government agencies. Among the findings of the stations\\' report: - In at least 18 of the 20 categories measured, the data revealed inequities in more than half of the United States\\' largest cities. Among the 52 metro areas sampled, 34 are major metropolitan areas with at least 1 million residents. Twenty-three of the cities are in the Southern states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Among the 100 cities studied, all had inequities in at least 11 of the 20 categories measured. - The inequities highlighted in the report were most widespread in the areas of housing, wealth, and interactions with police. The data revealed inequities across all five housing and wealth measurements in 87 of the 100 cities studied. The review found inequity in all three policing measurements in 86 cities. - The data show that white families are more likely to own their home in all 100 metro areas. The homeownership gap for Black families was more than 30 percentage points in more than half the metro areas. - Data from the FBI and local police agencies show Black residents were more likely to be arrested in all 100 metro areas, and that they were at least twice as likely to be arrested in 95 of them. - In all but one of the 100 metro areas, an analysis of census data showed that the share of police officers who are white is larger than the share of residents who are white. In five cities including the metro areas of Durham, N.C., Portland and Las Vegas, the makeup of law enforcement agencies was whiter than their communities by more than 20 percentage points. Asian Americans were underrepresented among police in 97 of the 100 metro areas, including in every county in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Asian Americans make up around 18% of all police officers despite accounting for 34% of the population. - Data from local schools and the U.S. Department of Education showed that Black students were twice as likely to miss days of school for suspensions than white students in 95 of 100 metro areas. \"We\\'re looking for fairness,\" said Melanie McQueen, a parent of a high school student of color in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, where the local school district\\'s data shows students of color accounted for 86% of suspensions despite making up only 43% of students. \"If my child did something wrong, it should not matter what color they are in regard to what their punishment is going to be.\" McQueen leads African-American Parents for Purposeful Leadership in Education, a group that has worked with school leaders to make sure policies are implemented equitably. In a statement released in response to the equity report\\'s findings, Oak Park River Forest district officials said they are \"committed to achieving racial equity\" and their \"vision of equitable excellence centers on eliminating the disparities that exist in our district.\" The equity report\\'s data analysis also found that access to Advanced Placement courses, which give students an advantage in college admission and readiness, is more available to white students than students of color in more than half of the 100 cities studied. Heather Bennett, Director of Equity Services for the Pennsylvania School Boards Association, said her state is working to bridge those kinds of gaps. \"That\\'s what equity is,\" Bennett said in response to the report\\'s findings. \"It\\'s literally saying, \\'I believe every single one of our children are gifted -- but they\\'re gifted in different ways and require different things and resources.\\' So what are we going to do to make sure that they are going to be successful, based upon their idea of success?\"\\nThe Biden administration is renewing efforts to shield hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to the United States as young children from deportation, the latest maneuver in a long-running drama over the policys legality WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration on Monday renewed efforts to shield hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to the United States as young children from deportation, the latest maneuver in a long-running drama over the policys legality. The administration proposed a rule that attempts to satisfy concerns of a federal judge in Houston who ruled in July that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was illegal, largely because the Obama administration bypassed procedural requirements when it took effect in 2012. The new rule mirrors the Obama-era initiative, recreating the 2012 policy and seeking to put it on firmer ground by going through the federal regulatory process. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, an appointee of President George W. Bush, said the Obama administration overstepped its authority and did not properly seek public feedback. He allowed for renewals to continue but prohibited new enrollments. The Biden administration is appealing. The 205-page proposal solicits public feedback to address Hanen\\'s concern, though it is unclear if that would be enough. The proposed regulation will be published Tuesday in the Federal Register, triggering a 60-day comment period and ensuring that it is unlikely to take effect for several months. The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who challenged DACA with eight other states before Hanen, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Obama administration created DACA with a memo issued by then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. It was intended as a stopgap measure until Congress legislated a permanent solution, which never occurred. And because DACA isn\\'t the product of legislation, it falls into a category of policies that can more easily be changed from one administration to the next. President Donald Trump tried to rescind the DACA memo and end the program, but the Supreme Court concluded he did not go about it properly. In attempting to shore up DACA through a formal rule -- which is a more rigorous process than the original memo, though still not legislation -- the Biden administration hopes to gain a legal stamp of approval from the courts. It seems possible, if not likely, that the Supreme Court will once again be called upon to weigh in, unless Congress acts first. The Biden administration\\'s move comes as congressional Democrats struggle to include immigration provisions in their 10-year, $3.5 trillion package of social and environment initiatives. Language in that bill helping millions of immigrants remain permanently in the U.S. has been a top goal of progressive and pro-immigration lawmakers, and Democrats cannot afford to lose many votes. But the Senates nonpartisan parliamentarian said earlier this month the immigration provisions couldnt remain in the sweeping bill because it violated the chambers budget rules. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called again on Monday for Congress to act swiftly to provide \"the legal status they need and deserve.\" \"The Biden-Harris Administration continues to take action to protect Dreamers and recognize their contributions to this country,\" said Mayorkas, using a commonly used term for immigrants who came to the U.S. with their parents as young children. \"This notice of proposed rulemaking is an important step to achieve that goal.\" Some pro-immigration advocates echoed Mayorkas\\' view that the onus is on Congress. \"A more formalized version of DACA will stabilize the lives of DACA-eligible Dreamers but legislative action is still needed to fully solidify DACA recipients contributions, expand protections to other Dreamers and build a pathway to permanent legal status,\" said Ali Noorani, president of the National Immigration Forum. \"Formalizing DACA is a positive step, but its not a permanent fix.\" The Democratic-run House passed legislation earlier this year creating a way for Dreamers to become legal permanent residents, but the bill has gone nowhere in the Senate, where Republicans have blocked it and bipartisan talks have stalled. The Senate parliamentarian\\'s ruling further dampened legislative prospects. Advocates have said they would present alternative immigration provisions in hopes they would be permitted in the bill, but it\\'s not clear that would succeed. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School, said the administration\\'s proposal carries no major changes and \"is an effort to bulletproof the existing program from litigation challenges.\" The proposal adheres to the same criteria, which include arriving in the country before age 16, continuously residing in the United States since arrival and being in the country on June 15, 2012. Since 2012, more than 825,000 immigrants have enrolled in DACA. --- Spagat contributed from San Diego.

No single group dominates at the ballot box in the nations second-most-populous city, which makes coalition-building an essential task. Democratic U.S. Rep. Karen Bass formally stepped into the 2022 contest Monday, hoping to become the first female and the second Black mayor. Tom Bradley, the first Black mayor, held the post from 1973 to 1993. Bass represents a district in Congress that is anchored to some of the citys traditional Black neighborhoods, where she also grew up. She promised to prioritize the citys unchecked homeless crisis, which has seen trash-strewn encampments spread into virtually every corner of the city. \"Ive spent my entire life bringing groups of people together in coalitions to solve complex problems and produce concrete change, especially in times of crisis,\" Bass said in a statement. \"With my whole heart, Im ready,\" she tweeted. Bass will be competing for votes with an array of diverse candidates. City Councilman Kevin de Leon, who once led the state Senate before being termed out, is a Latino born to a Guatemalan mother and father with Chinese ancestry; Black businessman Mel Wilson is from the San Fernando Valley area; Jessica Lall, who leads a downtown business group and is of Indian descent; City Attorney Mike Feuer is Jewish; and city Councilman Joe Buscaino, who spent 15 years with the Los Angeles Police Department is a first-generation Italian American whose parents came from Sicily. The race is nonpartisan but the leading contenders all are Democrats, unsurprising in a city where the partys voters outnumber Republicans 3-to-1. Bass and de Leon are favorites of the partys progressive wing, with other candidates parked across the Democratic spectrum. The winner of the 2022 contest will inherit a city facing a tangle of urban ills, including buckled roads and sidewalks, a spiking crime rate, L.A.s notoriously snarled traffic and home prices that have soared out of reach for many working-class families. The primary is in June. Candidates will need to communicate with voters in scores of neighborhoods with separate identities: single-family homeowners in the vast sprawl of the San Fernando Valley, Latinos who predominate east of downtown, young professionals in trendy Silver Lake or residents in the traditionally Black neighborhoods of South Los Angeles. The Asian vote is in play in the Koreatown and Little Tokyo neighborhoods, and there are sizeable populations of Armenians, Russians and others. Ninety-two languages other than English are spoken in the Los Angeles Unified School District, which enrolls 650,000 students in L.A. and surrounding communities. \"This city is a quilt with different patterns on it,\" said Democratic consultant Michael Trujillo, who is advising Buscaino. The overarching issue will be homelessness, he predicted, with voters looking for a candidate who will put a date on the calendar to end the lines of sagging tents and rusty RVs that have become fixtures along freeways, on vacant lots and below overpasses. With such a diverse electorate \"you have to be able to speak with a common theme,\" Trujillo added. The candidate who can maintain that theme \"is most likely to become the next mayor of Los Angeles.\" In 2005, when Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa became the first Latino mayor in more than a century, he had to overcome fears in the Black community that they would be displaced from government jobs in favor of Latinos. When he was a candidate, Villaraigosa talked about overcoming the \"black-brown divide\" that can breed violence. Villaraigosa eventually won after vowing to unite the city and winning endorsements from prominent Black people, including Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters. He took the mayoralty from then-Mayor James Hahn, another Democrat who lost support in the Black community after the ouster of then-LAPD Chief Bernard Parks, who is Black. Bradley, also a Democrat, became the citys first Black mayor by building an alliance of Blacks and white liberals that shifted the city away from its conservative roots. Garcetti was first elected in 2013 with strong support from Latino and white voters, including in Republican-leaning areas, even though he was outperformed by rival Wendy Greuel in traditionally Black neighborhoods. Garcetti, nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as ambassador to India, often shifts into Spanish during his appearances and reminds audiences of his Mexican-Jewish-Italian roots, jokingly calling himself a \"kosher burrito.\" Bass, 67, was a physicians assistant and community organizer who became the first Black woman speaker of the state Assembly in 2008. Shes serving her sixth term in the House, and previously headed the Congressional Black Caucus. She was on Bidens short list when he was considering a vice presidential pick and she also is close to her fellow Californian who leads the U.S. House -- San Franciscos Nancy Pelosi. Latino and Black people are pillars of the Democratic Party in California and frequently end up on the same side of political issues, but there also has been conflict over the years as the Latino population in L.A. and across the state surged. Black people make up only about 9% of L.A.s population while Latinos are about half, though they can be inconsistent voters and many are too young to vote, or not citizens. Whites account for about 30% of residents. Jaime Regalado, former executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles, said winning primary candidates will need to put together a coalition that will generate 22% to 25% of the primary vote - enough to advance to a two-person November runoff in a crowded field. \"One group is not going to be enough,\" he said, adding that Bass is likely to draw a large chunk of the Black and liberal vote, forcing her rivals to hunt for support where they \"probably weren\\'t thinking of looking for votes.\" With Bass getting in, it\\'s \"a scramble,\" he said.\\nInstagram is putting a hold on the development of Instagram kids, geared towards children under 13, so it can address concerns about the vulnerability of younger users Facebook is putting a hold on the development of a kids\\' version of Instagram, geared toward children under 13, to address concerns that have been raised about the vulnerability of younger users. \"I still firmly believe that its a good thing to build a version of Instagram thats designed to be safe for tweens, but we want to take the time to talk to parents and researchers and safety experts and get to more consensus about how to move forward,\" said Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, in an interview Monday on NBCs \"Today\" show. Yet the development of Instagram for a younger audience was met with broader opposition almost immediately. They cited increased cyberbullying, possible vulnerability to online predators, and what they called Facebooks \"checkered record\" in protecting children on its platforms. Facebook faced similar criticism in 2017 when it launched the Messenger Kids app, touted as a way for children to chat with family members and friends approved by parents. Josh Golin, executive director of childrens digital advocacy group Fairplay, urged the company Monday to permanently pull the plug on the app. So did a group of Democratic members of Congress. \"Facebook is heeding our calls to stop plowing ahead with plans to launch a version of Instagram for kids,\" tweeted Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey. \"But a \\'pause\\' is insufficient. Facebook must completely abandon this project.\" The Senate had already planned a hearing Thursday with Facebook\\'s global safety head, Antigone Davis, to address what the company knows about how Instagram affects the mental health of younger users. Mosseri maintained Monday that the company believes it\\'s better for children under 13 to have a specific platform for age-appropriate content, and that other companies like TikTok and YouTube have app versions for that age group. He said in a blog post that it\\'s better to have a version of Instagram where parents can supervise and control their experience rather than relying on the companys ability to verify if kids are old enough to use the app. Mosseri said that Instagram for kids is meant for those between the ages of 10 and 12, not younger. It will require parental permission to join, be ad free, and will include age-appropriate content and features. Parents will be able to supervise the time their children spend on the app, oversee who can message them, who can follow them and who they can follow. While work is being paused on Instagram Kids, the company will be expanding opt-in parental supervision tools to teen accounts of those 13 and older. More details on these tools will be disclosed in the coming months, Mosseri said. This isn\\'t the first time Facebook has received backlash for a product aimed at children. Child development experts urged the company to shut down its Messenger Kids app in 2018, saying it was not responding to a \"need\" as Facebook insisted but creating one instead. In that case, Facebook went ahead with the app. --- AP Technology Writers Matt OBrien and Barbara Ortutay contributed to this report.\\nA federal judge says the man who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan four decades ago can be released unconditionally from the restrictions he\\'s been living under next year if he remains mentally stable A federal judge said Monday that John Hinckley Jr., who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan four decades ago, can be freed from all remaining restrictions next year if he continues to follow those rules and remains mentally stable. U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman in Washington said during a 90-minute court hearing that hell issue his ruling on the plan this week. Since Hinckley moved to Williamsburg, Virginia, from a Washington hospital in 2016, court-imposed restrictions have required doctors and therapists to oversee his psychiatric medication and therapy. Hinckley has been barred from having a gun. And he cant contact Reagans children, other victims or their families, or actress Jodie Foster, who he was obsessed with at the time of the 1981 shooting. Friedman said Hinckley, now 66, has displayed no symptoms of active mental illness, no violent behavior and no interest in weapons since 1983. \"If he hadn\\'t tried to kill the president, he would have been unconditionally released a long, long, long time ago,\" the judge said. \"But everybody is comfortable now after all of the studies, all of the analysis and all of the interviews and all of the experience with Mr. Hinckley.\" Friedman said the plan is to release Hinckley from all court supervision in June. A 2020 violence risk assessment conducted on behalf of Washingtons Department of Behavioral Health concluded that Hinckley would not pose a danger if he\\'s unconditionally released. The U.S. government had previously opposed ending restrictions. But it recently retained an independent expert to examine Hinckley and took a different position Monday, with attorneys saying they would agree to unconditional release if Hinckley follows the rules and shows mental stability for the next nine months. Kacie Weston, an attorney for the U.S. government, said it wants to make sure Hinckley can adapt to living on his own for the first time in 40 years. He recently moved out his mother\\'s house, which sits along a golf course in a gated community in Williamsburg. She died in July. Attorneys did not say where Hinckley is currently living. \"Mr. Hinckley does have a history of turning inward, and toward isolation,\" Weston said. Another concern is the impending retirement of one of Hinckley\\'s therapists and the looming end to a therapy group, which has provided much support and social interaction. Weston said Hinckley will likely face challenges finding a similar group in the future. \"All we have to do is wait a few more months and see,\" Weston said. \"And well have actual hard data. Well have information in real time to see how Mr. Hinckley adapts.\" The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said in a statement that it was \"saddened\" by the court\\'s plan. \"Contrary to the judges decision, we believe John Hinckley is still a threat to others and we strongly oppose his release,\" the foundation said. \"Our hope is that the Justice Department will file a motion with the court leading to a reversal of this decision.\" Hinckley was 25 when he shot and wounded the 40th U.S. president outside a Washington hotel. The shooting paralyzed Reagan press secretary James Brady, who died in 2014. It also injured Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington police officer Thomas Delahanty. Hinckley did not attend Monday\\'s hearing. But Barry Levine, his attorney, said Hinckley wanted to express his \"heartfelt\" apologies and \"profound regret\" to the people he shot and their families as well as to Foster and the American people. \"Perhaps it is too much to ask for forgiveness,\" Levine said. \"But we hope they have an understanding that the acts that caused him to do this terrible thing (were caused by) mental illness.\" Hinckley was suffering from acute psychosis. When jurors found him not guilty by reason of insanity, they said he needed treatment and not a lifetime in confinement. Such an acquittal meant that Hinckley could not be blamed or punished for what he did, legal experts have said. Hinckley was ordered to live at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington. In the 2000s, Hinckley began making visits to his parents home in Williamsburg. A 2016 court order granted him permission to live with his mom full time after experts said his mental illness had been in remission for decades. Friedman, the judge, has loosened some of Hinckleys restrictions over the years. For instance, Hinckley was granted the right to publicly display his artwork and allowed to move out of his mothers house. But hes still barred from traveling to places where he knows there will be someone protected by the Secret Service. Hinckley must give three days notice if he wants to travel more than 75 miles (120 kilometers) from home. He also has to turn over passwords for computers, phones and online accounts such as email. In recent years, Hinckley has sold items from a booth at an antique mall that hes found at estate sales, flea markets and consignment shops. Hes also shared his music on YouTube. \"I would hope that people will see this as a victory for mental health,\" Levine, Hinckley\\'s attorney, said Monday. \"That is the real message in this case -- that people who have been ravaged by mental disease, with good support and access to treatment, can actually become productive members of society.\"\\nWASHINGTON -- Rep. Liz Cheney says she was wrong to oppose gay marriage in the past, a stand that once split her family. Cheney, R-Wyo., a fierce critic of fellow Republican Donald Trump, also tells CBS News\\' \"60 Minutes\" that she views her reelection campaign as the most important House race in the nation as forces aligned with the former president try to unseat her. She voted to impeach Trump over his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. In the interview aired Sunday night, Cheney said she had little affection for President Joe Biden, who she believes has embraced harmful polices for the economy and national security with the Afghanistan withdrawal. \"But the alternative cannot be a man who doesnt believe in the rule of law, and who violated his oath of office,\" Cheney said. The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney was an ascendant Republican leader before the Jan. 6 riot, yet she is increasingly defined by her public opposition to Trump and his hold on the GOP. Cheney, 55, noted that she still talks with her father every night and that they share the same views on rejecting Trump. In the interview, Cheney said her opposition to gay marriage was misguided and she channeled her sister-in-law\\'s Facebook post in explaining why she changed her position. \"I was wrong. I was wrong,\" she said. \"Its a very personal issue -- and very personal for my family. I believe that my dad was right. And my sister and I have had that conversation ... Freedom means freedom for everybody.\" While still opposed to gun control, abortion and the Affordable Care Act, or \"Obamacare,\" the Wyoming congresswoman finds herself on the outs for voting to impeach Trump after his Jan. 6 rally preceded a mob storming the Capitol in hopes of overturning his reelection loss to Biden. Trump continues to falsely claim election fraud in spite of results being certified by states and Republican election officials and courts rejecting dozens of legal challenges. After voting to impeach Trump, Cheney lost her leadership post as chair of the House Republican Conference. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put her on a nine-person committee to investigate the Jan. 6 assault and she serves as vice chair. Trump has vowed to defeat Cheney in next year\\'s primary election by backing Republican Harriet Hageman, an attorney. Cheney, seeking a fourth term, said nothing less than the authority of the Constitution is at stake. \"I think its going to be the most important House race in the country in 2022. And -- and it will be one where people do have the opportunity to say, \\'We want to stand for the Constitution,\" Cheney said. \"A vote against me in this race, a vote for whomever Donald Trump has endorsed, is a vote for somebody whos willing to perpetuate the big lie, somebody whos willing to put allegiance to Trump above allegiance to the Constitution, absolutely.\" The Wyoming congresswoman criticized House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California for sticking with Trump after the assault on the Capitol. \"What hes done is embrace Donald Trump,\" she said. \"And if I were doing what hes doing, I would be deeply ashamed of myself. I dont know how you explain that to your children. When you are in a situation where you have somebody who did what Donald Trump did, it is absolutely clear he cannot continue to be somebody you embrace.\"\\nWASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden\\'s national security adviser Jake Sullivan is traveling to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the U.S. presses for a cease-fire in the yearslong war between the kingdom and Houthi rebels in Yemen. Sullivan will be the highest-ranking Biden administration official to visit Saudi Arabia. Besides seeing the crown prince, often referred to by his initials, MBS, Sullivan is expected to meet with deputy defense minster Khalid bin Salman, a brother to the crown prince, according to two senior administration officials. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Biden White House has largely steered clear of the crown prince since making public in February a CIA report that showed MBS likely approved the killing of Washington Post columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in a 2018 operation at the kingdoms consulate in Istanbul. But the White House has resolved that bringing an end to perhaps the worlds most complex conflict cant be done without engaging with the most senior Saudi officials face to face, one senior administration official said. National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said Sullivan was traveling to Riyadh on Monday and would also visit the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally in the war, but did not provide additional details. Axios first reported that Sullivan was planning on traveling to the region. Sullivan is being dispatched at a moment when the situation in Yemen, the Arab world\\'s poorest country, has further deteriorated. Fighting has intensified in the key city of Marib, as Iran-backed rebels have sought to oust the Saudi-backed government from the oil-rich city in the country\\'s north. International efforts to end the war have been fruitless. Tim Lenderking, the U.S. special envoy for Yemen, called out the Houthis in July for continuing \"to refuse to engage meaningfully on a cease-fire and political talks.\" Saudi Arabia offered a cease-fire proposal to Yemens Houthi rebels earlier this year as it looked to rehabilitate its image with the Biden administration. The Saudis have drawn international criticism for airstrikes killing civilians and embargoes exacerbating hunger in a nation on the brink of famine. The new U.N. special envoy to Yemen, Hans Grundberg, recently declared that the country is \"stuck in an indefinite state of war\" and resuming negotiations to end the more than six-year conflict wont be easy. Yemens war began in September 2014, when the Iranian-backed Houthis seized Sanaa and began a march south to try to seize the entire country. Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates and other countries, entered the war alongside Yemens internationally recognized government in March 2015. The U.S. sold bombs and fighter jets to Saudi Arabia that the kingdom later used in strikes on Yemen that also killed civilians. The Obama administration in 2015 initially offered U.S. targeting assistance to Saudi Arabias command-and-control operations that was supposed to minimize civilian casualties in airstrikes. It didnt, and Obama ultimately cut back on the program. Under President Donald Trump, targeting assistance continued although his administration later stopped U.S. refueling operations for Saudi jets. Biden announced weeks into his administration that he was ending all American support for \"offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arms sales.\" But there has been little progress on the ground in resolving what the United Nations says is the worlds worst humanitarian crisis. White House officials are hopeful that the appointment of Grundberg will bring a new dynamic and put pressure on all sides to bring an end to the conflict, according to two senior administration officials. Sullivan is being joined for the talks with the Saudis and the UAE by Lenderking and NSC senior director for the Middle East Brett McGurk. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin planned to travel to Saudi Arabia earlier this month while he was in the region but postponed due to what the administration said were scheduling issues. The high-level White House push comes after Lenderking traveled to Saudi Arabia and Oman, which has pressed for an end to the war. In addition, Secretary of State Antony Blinken had talks with his counterpart members of the Gulf Cooperation Council on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly. Sullivan\\'s visit to Saudi Arabia also comes as the administration is looking for ways to resurrect the Iran nuclear deal. The Saudis and the UAE fiercely oppose returning to the deal with Iran that was originally brokered in 2015 by the Obama administration only to be scrapped by Trump in 2018. Addressing the U.N. General Assembly on Friday, Irans new foreign minister Hossain Amir Abdollah said the country will return to nuclear negotiations in Vienna \"very soon.\" But he accused the Biden administration of sending contradictory messages by saying it wants to rejoin the pact while slapping new sanctions on Tehran and not taking \"an iota of positive action.\" Biden and his team have made a U.S. return to the deal -- to which Britain, France, Russia, China, Germany and Iran are signatories -- one of their top foreign policy priorities. But the U.S. has made limited headway in indirect talks, and Tehran has bristled at Biden administration officials\\' call for a \"longer and stronger\" deal than the original, which expires at the end of 2030.\\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Facing a Justice Department lawsuit over Alabama\\'s notoriously violent prisons, state lawmakers on Monday began a special session on a $1.3 billion construction plan that would use federal pandemic relief funds to pay part of the cost of building massive new lockups. Gov. Kay Ivey has touted the plan to build three new prisons and renovate others as a partial solution to the states longstanding troubles in its prison system. The proposal would tap up to $400 million from the states share of American Rescue Plan funds to help pay for the construction. \"It\\'s the right thing to do,\" Republican Sen. Greg Albritton said of the construction plan. \"We cant expect people to come to work when they dont know theyre going to be able to leave work alive. We cant expect to house people, inmates, in conditions that are deteriorating and unhealthy. Weve got to fix the problems. The prisons are falling in.\" But critics of the plan say the states prison problems go beyond building conditions -- and urged the state to look to more sweeping sentencing reforms. They also argued that the state should not be using pandemic relief dollars to build prisons. U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York sent a letter Monday to Treasury Department Secretary Janet Yellen asking Treasury to \"prevent the misuse of (American Rescue Plan) funding by any state, including Alabama\" to build prisons. \"Directing funding meant to protect our citizens from a pandemic to fuel mass incarceration is, in direct contravention of the intended purposes of the ARP legislation,\" Nadler wrote in the letter. The Alabama prison construction proposal calls for at least three new prisons -- a prison in Elmore County with at least 4,000 beds and enhanced space for medical and mental health care needs; another prison with at least 4,000 beds in Escambia County; and a womens prison -- as well as renovations to existing facilities. Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, said he has some concerns about building prisons with money that he said was set aside to mitigate the ongoing pandemic crisis. \"Remember, we are now still number one in the country for deaths,\" Hatcher said of Alabama\\'s COVID-19 death rate that recently led the country. Republican legislative leaders said they are comfortable they can legally use the funds because the American Rescue Plan, in addition to authorizing the dollars for economic and health care programs, says states can use the money to replace revenue lost during the pandemic to strengthen support for vital public services and help retain jobs. Ivey and GOP legislative leaders have said using the money will enable the state to essentially \"pay cash\" for part of the construction and avoid using state dollars as well as paying interest on a loan. The Department of Justice last year sued Alabama, saying the state prisons for men are \"riddled with prisoner-on-prisoner and guard-on-prisoner violence.\" The department noted in a 2019 report that dilapidated conditions were a contributing factor to what it called unconstitutional conditions but emphasized that, \"new facilities alone will not resolve the contributing factors to the overall unconstitutional condition of ADOC prisons, such as understaffing, culture, management deficiencies, corruption, policies, training, non-existent investigations, violence, illicit drugs, and sexual abuse.\" The state has disputed the accusations from the Justice Department but has acknowledged problems with staffing and building conditions. Legislative leaders have said action is needed to stave off additional court intervention in the system. \"We\\'ve got a huge effort moving forward with a good plan. This is not some one-time fix. This is not a Band-Aid. I\\'m hoping that the courts will see that,\" House Speaker Mac McCutcheon said. While prison construction is the centerpiece of the special session, it also includes two policy changes: proposals to make retroactive both the 2013 sentencing standards and a 2015 law on mandatory supervision of released inmates. Bennet Wright, executive director of the Alabama Sentencing Commission, said they estimated that would allow up to 700 inmates to apply for reduced sentences. Some lawmakers had hoped for broader reforms on sentencing and to address the state\\'s slow rate of paroles. Minority Leader Anthony Daniels said he expects floor amendments to try to expand the sentencing bill, but said it\\'s a \"start.\" \"I think we need to go farther than where we are going. ... But what do you do? Do you take changing 700 lives or do you do nothing?\" Daniels said. Sandy Ray, the mother of an inmate killed in a state prison in 2019, came to the Statehouse Monday and showed lawmakers a photo of her son\\'s battered face following an altercation with guards. New prisons might help, she said, but there needs to be broader changes, otherwise it\\'s, \"still going to be the same problems in the new buildings.\" \"They are still killing people in the prison system and its worse than it was in 2019 when my son died,\" she said.\\nFacebook announced Monday that it was pausing development of its controversial \"Instagram Kids\" platform meant for children under the age of 13. \"While we stand by the need to develop this experience, weve decided to pause this project,\" Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, said in company blog post Monday. \"This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today.\" \"Critics of \\'Instagram Kids\\' will see this as an acknowledgement that the project is a bad idea,\" Mosseri added. \"Thats not the case. The reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today.\" He noted how YouTube and TikTok have already created versions of their apps for those under 13. Instagram\\'s goal was to allow parents to supervise and control their tweens\\' experience on a version built for users ages 10 to 12, he said. \"We firmly believe that its better for parents to have the option to give their children access to a version of Instagram that is designed for them -- where parents can supervise and control their experience -- than relying on an apps ability to verify the age of kids who are too young to have an ID,\" Mosseri wrote. While Instagram Kids has been paused, Mosseri said the company will continue to build opt-in parental supervision tools for teens and expects to have more to share on this in the coming months. The \"Instagram Kids\" proposal has faced pushback for months. In May, a bipartisan coalition of 44 state and territory attorneys general sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg urging the company to abandon the project, citing the potential for harm to children. Lawmakers also pressed Zuckerberg over the project during a March hearing, when he argued that there is \"a large number of people under the age of 13 who would want to use a service like Instagram\" and that it could provide \"broadly positive\" benefits such as helping young people stay connected with friends and learn about content online. Monday\\'s announcement also comes in the wake of a Wall Street Journal investigation that alleged Facebook\\'s own internal research found Instagram harmful for young users, especially teenage girls. Facebook and Instagram have argued the reporting mischaracterizes what they are trying to do and that research also shows positive benefits. \"Recent reporting from the WSJ on our research into teens experiences on Instagram has raised a lot of questions for people,\" Mosseri wrote Monday. \"To be clear, I dont agree with how the Journal has reported on our research.\" \"We do research like this so we can make Instagram better,\" he added. \"That means our insights often shed light on problems, but they inspire new ideas and changes to Instagram.\" Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle did not seem appeased by Facebook\\'s announcement. \"Pausing Instagram kids is not enough,\" Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colorado, wrote on Twitter Monday. \"They need to abolish the program completely.\" Another vocal critic of the project, Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said on Twitter, \"Facebook is heeding our calls to stop plowing ahead with plans to launch a version of Instagram for kids. But a \\'pause\\' is insufficient.\" \"Facebook must completely abandon this project,\" Markey added.\\nRecreational pot has become legal for more Americans, but despite that ease of access, marijuana use hasn\\'t ignited, a study released Monday found. An article published in The Journal of the American Medical Association found there was no increase in cannabis use among the general population or among previous users after their states legalized marijuana. Researchers surveyed about 830,000 Americans over age 12 on their reported cannabis use, both before and after recreational marijuana was passed in their state. The study looked at data between 2008 and 2017. Washington state and Colorado became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, after which marijuana use saw a slight increase among Hispanic and white participants, researchers said. The study also found there were no changes in cannabis use or cannabis use disorder for individuals between the ages of 12 and 20 in the states that legalized the substance. As of Sept. 27, 18 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana use for adults over 21. In this year alone, four states, New York, New Mexico, Virginia and Connecticut, legalized the substance. ABC News\\' Dr. Ronnye Rutledge contributed to this report.\\nA federal judge approved a plan Monday to unconditionally release John Hinckley Jr., who had shot and wounded former President Ronald Reagan in 1981, from all remaining court-ordered restrictions, if he continues to follow rules and agrees to undergo regular mental health examinations. U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman said he plans on issuing his ruling on the plan later this week, the Associated Press reported. Hinckley, who was previously granted conditional release in 2016, was allowed to stay at his mother\\'s home in Williamsburg, Virginia. Since then, he has been kept under regular court-ordered supervision and mandated therapy. Hinckley, now 66, is not allowed to own a gun, contact Reagan\\'s children, other victims or their families, or actress Jodie Foster - who he was obsessed with at the time of the 1981 shooting. Friedman said Hinckley could be released from all court supervision by June 2022, if he continues to follow those rules. According to the Associated Press, Hinckley has displayed no symptoms of active mental illness, no violent behavior and no interest in weapons since 1983, said Friedman.\\nA home in Massachusetts seriously damaged by fire has been listed on the market with an asking price of $399,000 MELROSE, Mass. -- A home in Massachusetts seriously damaged by fire has been listed on the market with an asking price of $399,000. WBZ-TV reported Monday that the listing for the home in Melrose, a suburb of Boston, is evidence of how hot the housing market is. In August, industry groups listed the median sale price of single family homes in the state to be between $535,000 and $552,000. The online listing for the burned three-bedroom, 1,857-square foot (173-square meter) home starts with a call out to contractors, and continues: \"House is in need of a complete renovation or potential tear down and rebuild. Buyer to do due diligence. House being sold as is.\" The house suffered an intense fire in August that blew out the front windows, which are now boarded up. The Boston Globe reported that firefighters had to tear out parts of the walls and ceiling of the home to extinguish the blaze.\\nThe frozen DiGiorno Crispy Pan Crust pepperoni pizza is part of the recall. The frozen DiGiorno Crispy Pan Crust pepperoni pizza has been found to contain textured soy protein, a known allergen that is not declared on the label, the U.S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced Monday. Nestle USA Inc. is recalling 27,872 pounds of the pizza product after a consumer complaint found that the frozen pepperoni pizza product carton may actually contain the frozen three-meat pizza, according to the FSIS release. The recalled pizza products were produced on Jun. 30, 2021 and shipped nationwide. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions, the release stated. ABC News reached out to Nestle for comment, but has not received word at this time.\\nNorthwestern University says it is investigating two fraternity houses after students say they were non-consensually drugged during gatherings at the Evanston, Illinois, campus locations. There is also now a criminal investigation into the incidents by local police. The university has yet to determine how many students were allegedly involved. On Saturday, school officials halted social events and chapter-sponsored recruitment activities at some campus fraternities. The suspension will last until Oct. 17, at the earliest. The university is encouraging students to seek on-campus counseling and other health services as needed as student protests erupt at the two locations where the incidents allegedly took place. \"I am here because multiple survivors have come forward stating the harm that they experienced in this frat and others,\" one student told the ABC Chicago station. \"This is not a unique instance.\" School officials said in a statement that they have been in communication with the Interfraternity Council, the governing body of many fraternities, and it \"understand[s] the seriousness of these reports and the importance of the investigations.\" The IFC also passed a resolution to institute a ban on all social activities inclusive of recruitment events during this time frame. \"This decision was made to help ensure the safety of our students,\" a university representative told ABC News. \"As we said in our message to the Northwestern community, the health, safety and well-being of our students is our top priority.\" The university has since reminded students of the policy against alcohol in on-campus fraternity and sorority houses. Northwestern University Police is urging people with information on these reports to call 847-491-3456.\\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida filed suit against President Joe Biden\\'s administration Tuesday claiming his immigration policy is illegal, and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an order barring state agencies from assisting with the relocation of undocumented immigrants arriving in the state. DeSantis\\' order authorized the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Florida Highway Patrol \"to detain any aircraft, bus, or other vehicle within the State of Florida reasonably believed to be transporting illegal aliens to Florida from the Southwest Border\" -- if allowed by federal and state law. The caveat that the law must be followed likely prevents them from seizing federal aircraft. He also ordered the agencies to gather information on the identities of any immigrants arriving illegally in Florida from the Mexico border and told state agencies not to spend money assisting those immigrants unless required by law. Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani criticized DeSantis, saying he\\'s using the immigration issue to score political points with his conservative base instead of focusing on other issues facing the state. \"He is completely bonkers and just wants to distract everyday people from real life issues,\" she said. \"We have an affordable housing crisis, we have climate change to worry about, we have folks that can\\'t find a good paying job. There\\'s so many issues around us and this is what he chooses.\" Attorney General Ashley Moody\\'s lawsuit claims the federal immigration policy will cost the state millions of dollars and cause harm to Florida. \"While some arriving migrants have legitimate asylum claims, many do not. Some are gang members and drug traffickers exploiting the crisis at the border, as evidenced by the skyrocketing amount of Fentanyl seized at the border this year,\" the suit says. Moody and DeSantis held a news conference in southwest Florida in which both strongly condemned Biden on immigration and praised former President Donald Trump\\'s policies. \"President Biden is aiding and abetting criminal cartels,\" Moody said. Asked about the lawsuit and DeSantis\\' order, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she hadn\\'t seen the suit. \"Any Republican or any member who wants to have a constructive conversation about solutions to addressing what we all agree is not a long-term sustainable operational or moral approach to immigration, we\\'re happy to have that conversation,\" Psaki said. DeSantis, considered a potential 2024 presidential candidate, has been attacking Biden on immigration for months. He sent Florida law enforcement officers to Texas to help deter illegal border crossings and he and Moody later visited the border and held a news conference to talk about the issue.\\nLong already accepted a life sentence for four murders in Cherokee County. The 22-year-old man behind the Atlanta-area spa shootings that killed eight people in March pleaded not guilty to four murders in Fulton County. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Robert Aaron Long appeared in court Tuesday for the charges related to four deaths at two spas. At the brief hearing, his lawyer waived arraignment and entered a not guilty plea to all charges, including murder, aggravated assault and domestic terrorism, and requested additional time to file motions. The next hearing date is slated for Nov. 23. He is accused of launching the shooting spree on March 16. Six of the eight victims were Asian women. Long was indicted in Fulton County for the deaths of Suncha Kim, 69; Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; and Yong Ae Yue, 63. Those shootings took place at Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa. In May, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis said shed seek the death penalty and hate crime charges against Long. She had filed sentencing enhancements under Georgias hate crime law, which offers guidelines for anyone convicted of targeting a person based on race, color, religion and gender. Willis said at the time that race and gender played a role in the shooting. Long\\'s already been sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus an additional 35 years, after he pleaded guilty in July to four counts of murder and other charges regarding deaths at a spa in Cherokee County. At the time he said he loathed his sexual addiction and it drove him to transfer blame from himself to sex workers at the spas he frequented for sex. The victims killed at Young\\'s Asian Massage near the Atlanta suburb of Woodstock in Cherokee County were Xiaojie \"Emily\" Tan, 49; Daoyou Feng, 44; Delaina Yaun, 33; and Paul Michels, 54.\\nFive Gazette employees were killed in the June 2018 shooting. Jarrod Warren Ramos, the gunman who killed five Capital Gazette employees in June 2018, was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Ramos, 41, pleaded guilty to 23 criminal charges in connection with the Annapolis, Maryland, newsroom shooting but used an insanity defense to claim he was not criminally responsible. A jury found him criminally responsible over the summer. Anne Arundel County Judge Michael Wachs handed down the sentence of five consecutive life sentences to be served without the chance for parole, bringing an end to the long, legal battle. Ramos did not make a statement in court. He was also sentenced to an additional life in prison plus 345 years, all to run consecutively, Anne Arundel County State Attorney\\'s office said in a statement. Ramos opened fire on employees inside the Capital Gazette\\'s office building, killing Wendi Winters, John McNamera, Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen and Rebecca Smith. Family members of victims and survivors of the shooting spoke during the emotional hearing. \"There were days I wondered why I lived, but I lived to tell the truth. No shooter could kill this paper. You cant kill the truth,\" Selene San Felice, a reporter who survived the shooting, said to Ramos at the hearing, Maryland news radio station WBAL reported. Judge Wachs said that Ramos showed no remorse for his crimes and told a state psychiatrist hed kill more if he were ever released. \"The impact of this case is just simply immense,\" Wachs said, Associated Press reported. \"To say that the defendant exhibited a callous and complete disregard for the sanctity of human life is simply a huge understatement.\" Prosecutors said revenge was Ramos\\' motivation for the shooting. Ramos had accused the Capital Gazette of destroying his reputation when it covered his misdemeanor harassment conviction in 2011. He was accused of harassing a former female high school student and filed several lawsuits against the newspaper, which were dismissed by the courts. In a press conference following the sentencing, State Attorney Anne Colt Leitess said, \"Justice was served.\" \"He exploited his lawsuit and his losing of the lawsuit and killed innocent people just to feel better about himself,\" she said. \"The jury saw through that and the judge saw through that today, sentencing him to the maximum sentence under law.\"\\nReducing gun violence is a \"generational project,\" the former president said. Ahead of the groundbreaking of the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago, former President Barack Obama reflected on the gun violence that has plagued the Windy City and said that he intends for his presidential library to be a part of the solution. \"Chicago alone can\\'t solve the gun problem,\" Obama told \"Good Morning America\" anchor Robin Roberts in an exclusive interview that aired on Tuesday, adding that Congress needs to pass \"common sense gun safety measures.\" Gun reform efforts were repeatedly blocked by Republicans during Obama\\'s presidency and continue to stall in Congress. President Joe Biden announced a series of executive orders in April aimed at addressing gun violence and called on the Senate to pass a pair of gun reform bills adopted by the Democratic-led House, including a ban on assault weapons. \"Chicago alone can\\'t stop the easy access and flood of guns into these communities. But what we can do is potentially give young people the sense that there\\'s another way for them to empower themselves, other than wielding a gun,\" Obama said. Reflecting on violent crime in low-income communities in cities like Chicago, Obama said, \"The constant is young people, mostly young men, who have not gotten a good education, don\\'t have a good opportunity, are not seeing good role models, are living in neighborhoods that are frayed and fractured.\" A total of at least 2,688 shooting incidents have happened in Chicago this year, an 11% increase from the same period as last year, according to police department crime statistics. The city has recorded 602 homicides this year -- a 4% increase from 2020. Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown announced a new strategy to combat gun violence in July which includes a crackdown on illegal guns pouring into the city. Obama said that tackling the problem is a \"generational project\" -- one that he intends to address through Obama Presidential Center programs like My Brother\\'s Keeper, which works to create opportunities for boys and men of color in underserved communities. \"If we\\'re doing that in a systemic way, year after year, then over time, we can reduce these incidents of violence,\" he added. Other major cities across the U.S. are also grappling with a rise in shootings. President Joe Biden announced a range of actions in June aimed at curbing gun violence, saying that violent crime has \"spiked since the start of the pandemic.\" ABC News\\' Bill Hutchinson, Rick Klein, Quinn Owen, Katie Bosland, Mya Green and Danielle Genet contributed to this report.\\nAngela McCray left her job as a pharmacist to homeschool her three children as pandemic lockdowns closed public schools in Monroe, North Carolina. So when public schools in the region announced reopening plans, she was excited to return her daughter for in-class instruction. But McCray became concerned when her school district -- Union County Public Schools -- didnt announce any official plans to test students or even require masks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. \"I was being patient knowing that they would see the numbers increase and would change their mind,\" she said. That never happened. In fact, the school district decided to roll back its quarantine and contract-tracing requirements for students with positive cases, citing the need to ease the workload of school staff. It was a move that shocked and angered parents. \"As a pharmacist, as a mother, I couldnt stand by and continue to watch that happen,\" McCray said. \"We had to start getting action in place to figure out how we can push our elected officials to step in and make some changes.\" The district only reversed course on its quarantine requirements when the state threatened to sue. But it still has no plans to offer COVID-19 testing to students or to require masks, despite both being recommended by public health officials. \"Testing is not offered by the school system, and it is offered within the county,\" said Tahira Stalberte, assistant superintendent for communications and community relations at Union County Public Schools. \"If anyone wants a test, they can call our local health department and they can get them a test.\" Six months after President Joe Biden offered states $10 billion so schools could routinely test students and staff to prevent asymptomatic cases, the school year is being hindered by the virus. Some 925,000 children have become infected since school began this fall, according to data collected by the American Academy of Pediatrics, a staggering spike that has pushed many more kids into quarantine. Some states have rejected their share of the $10 billion in federal funds for COVID-19 testing in schools while others have been painfully slow in actually implementing virus mitigation plans. A survey of the nations 100 largest school districts from the Center on Reinventing Public Education found that less than 15% of those schools are utilizing federal funding dollars to establish COVID-19 in-school screening programs. A spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department said the federal government has disbursed the funds. But when it comes to the utilization of those dollars, its up to the states to distribute the money to those that need it, including school districts. The options for school districts range from working with the state government to stand up a screening program, outsourcing the testing and screening process to a third party vendor, or completely overseeing the student testing process themselves, which many school administrators -- particularly in smaller districts -- have described as an impossible task without additional support. The challenges in implementing steady in-school testing and mitigation strategies have been particularly acute in the South and Midwest. Texas has reported more than 125,000 positive COVID-19 cases in the first month since schools in the state reopened. Now with the spike in student caseloads, many Texas school districts are rethinking their testing strategies in the hopes that immediate changes will keep schools open and curb spread of the virus. After two teachers working in the Connally Independent School District -- serving the Waco, Texas area -- died from coronavirus-related complications, masks were mandated for every student and staff member. The requirement placed the school district in direct opposition to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who signed legislation banning mask mandates. \"With the loss of two beloved teachers, we know that concerns for physical and mental health are heightened,\" said Wesley Holt, Connally ISD superintendent, in a memo to parents. \"We want to assure you that we are focused on measures to take care of our students and staff.\" As matters like testing and mask-wearing remain fraught, highly politicized issues, school districts that find themselves in disagreement with their governors on these matters have had to adopt a go-it-alone approach. Iowas Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds rejected $95 million in federal funds offered to the state for in-school coronavirus testing, complicating matters for school districts urgently looking for funding to establish testing. \"There is confusion about funds Iowa had available last year for testing and contact tracing supposedly being returned before school districts knew they were available,\" said Phillip Roeder, a Des Moines Public Schools spokesperson, of the states returned federal COVID-19 testing dollars. In one of the nations wealthiest counties, Fairfax County in northern Virginia, officials have been slow to establish any kind of formal testing regimen for students and staff. \"We are exploring a public-private partnership to offer testing and vaccinations across schools and expect to have more soon,\" said a Fairfax County Public Schools spokesperson in a statement. \"Our current layered mitigation strategy has meant that less than 0.2 % of our in-school student and staff population has been quarantined due to a COVID exposure.\" Some school districts that have been slow to implement systematic testing have found themselves in the difficult position of choosing between overseeing the logistics of managing a COVID-19 screening programs at the beginning of a new school year or involving third-party vendors to manage them. \"In many states, there are a number of different testing vendors they [schools] can choose from,\" said Leah Perkinson, manager of the pandemics division at the Rockefeller Foundation. \"One of the most unfortunate parts about all of this is that there is a ton of guidance out there, but theres just not a lot of awareness about what the choices are.\" The New Orleans Public School system utilizes a testing program through the Louisiana Department of Health, in which students and their families can go to more than 91 school-based sites to get free routine COVID-19 PCR tests and receive results in under 24 hours. The school district, which serves over 44,000 students, gives schools the choice of opting into the testing program, but some schools within the district have decided its more appropriate to mandate testing. Overall, New Orleans school officials say participation in the testing program has shown promise, especially given an unnaturally busy hurricane season. \"We believe that following Hurricane Ida, it has actually boosted participation,\" said Morgan Ripski, COVID-19 testing coordinator for New Orleans Public Schools. \"The vast majority of our schools were not yet reopened, but what they did was open their sites as testing centers so students and parents could get tested before returning to the classroom.\" In the first few days after Hurricane Ida hit, more than 13,500 students were tested through the New Orleans Public Schools testing program in partnership with the Louisiana Department of Health. The COVID-19 positivity rate was 1%. For parents who learn their child has been exposed to COVID-19 in a school district like Union County Public Schools that has no testing protocols, the fear of what might happen next is all-consuming. Kenan Medlins son is immunocompromised and she was worried for days when she learned he was exposed to another student with COVID-19. Her sons recovery from respiratory illnesses typically takes longer than for other children. Medlin decided to pull her son out of class and homeschool him until the school district requires masks and offers testing. \"You should be able to go to public school and know that your child is going to be safe, cared for, and that the school will do everything they can to protect your children, but theyre just not doing that,\" she said. \"This is backing parents into a lot of corners and putting them in impossible situations.\"\\nAnimal rights groups have welcomed the South Korean presidents offer to look into banning consumption of dog meat SEOUL, South Korea -- Animal rights groups on Tuesday welcomed the South Korean president\\'s offer to look into banning consumption of dog meat. Dog meat is neither legal nor explicitly banned in South Korea. Restaurants that serve it are a dwindling business here as younger people find dog meat a less appetizing dining option. But some people oppose a ban as a surrender to Western pressure. During a meeting with his prime minister on Monday, President Moon Jae-in asked \"if its time to carefully consider\" a ban, according to his office. It\\'s unclear when a review would take place and when or whether a ban would be realized. A few activists gathered in central Seoul on Tuesday to call for the government and parliament to work out steps to officially prohibit dog meat consumption. They placed a big placard on the street that reads \"Legislate law banning the slaughters of dogs and cats!\" \"We actively welcome President Moon Jae-ins comments instructing a review of the dog meat consumption ban and hope there would be substantial progress on that,\" animal rights organizations said in a joint statement. Activists later visited Moons presidential office and Parliament to convey their calls for swift action to ban dog meat consumption, said Lee Won Bok, head of the Korea Association of Animal Protection. A public survey in 2018 indicated about 80% of South Koreans had not eaten dog meat in the previous year. Lee said an estimated about 1 million dogs are still killed each year in South Korea for food. Some older people in South Korea believe that dog meat enhances sexual stamina.\\nSome Democrats have criticized the Biden administration\\'s handing of the crisis. Former President Barack Obama believes the migrant crisis at the border in Del Rio, Texas, is \"heartbreaking\" and thinks comprehensive immigration reform is needed to fix \"a system that, overall, is dysfunctional.\" \"It\\'s no secret that we don\\'t have that. It\\'s the reason I proposed comprehensive immigration reform. It\\'s the reason Joe Biden proposed it during his administration, and it\\'s something that is long overdue,\" Obama told \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor Robin Roberts in an exclusive interview that aired Tuesday morning. As a candidate, Biden vowed to work with Democrats and Republicans to reach common ground on comprehensive immigration reform -- efforts that have stalled in Congress for two decades. Obama said that the crisis in Del Rio \"is a painful reminder that we don\\'t have this right yet and we\\'ve got more work to do.\" \"As big-hearted as he is, nobody understands that better than Joe Biden,\" Obama added. \"And the question is now: Are we gonna get serious about dealing with this problem in a systemic way, as opposed to these one-offs where we\\'re constantly reacting to emergencies? And I think that that\\'s something that every American should wanna put an end to.\" Biden vowed to implement a more humane approach to immigration than his predecessor, President Donald Trump, but now Biden is under fire from members of his own party over his administration\\'s handling of the migrant surge at the border in Del Rio. At the center of the criticism from Democrats is the Biden administration\\'s use of a Trump-era public health order to rapidly expel thousands of those migrants, mostly Haitian nationals, without giving them a chance to apply for asylum within the United States -- a move that violates U.S. asylum law, according to advocates challenging it in court. \"Despite the Administration\\'s rapid deployment of personnel and resources in response to this crisis, much of the strategy to address the care of these vulnerable individuals is deeply concerning,\" Democratic Reps. Bennie Thompson and Gregory W. Meeks said in a joint statement Wednesday. \"Specifically, we urge the Administration to halt repatriations to Haiti until the country recovers from these devastating crises.\" The Biden administration is defending its use of a Trump-era public health order to deport migrant families in court, arguing that lifting it would lead to overcrowding at DHS facilities, and that an influx of migrants, amid the delta variant surge, poses a public health risk. So far, more than a dozen flights have taken about 4,000 people back to Haiti, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on CNN on Sunday. At one point, there were more than 14,000 migrants in Del Rio, putting a strain on Customs and Border Patrol resources. The influx of migrants from Haiti came after civil unrest erupted this summer following the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise and a 7.2 magnitude earthquake that devastated the Caribbean nation. \"Immigration is tough. It always has been because, on the one hand, I think we are naturally a people that wants to help others. And we see tragedy and hardship and families that are desperately trying to get here so that their kids are safe, and they\\'re in some cases fleeing violence or catastrophe,\" Obama said. \"At the same time, we\\'re a nation state. We have borders. The idea that we can just have open borders is something that ... as a practical matter, is unsustainable.\" Obama also weighed in on Biden\\'s attempts to unite Democrats as divisions within the party threaten to imperil the president\\'s domestic agenda. Amid ongoing disagreements within the party over a $3.5 trillion so-called \"human infrastructure\" bill, Biden met last week with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, as well as moderate and progressive Democrats from both chambers. \"And as far as Democrats are concerned, I think President Biden is handling it exactly right, which is one of the great strengths of the Democratic Party is we\\'re diverse,\" Obama said. \"We come from all parts of the country. We look like the country as a whole.\" Obama said the country \"desperately needs\" the programs Biden has planned and predicted that the infrastructure package will pass. \"Any time Democrats try to pass legislation, there\\'s gonna be some negotiation and back and forth and sometimes some arguments that spill out into the press,\" he said. \"At the end of the day though, Democrats believe that we can make an economy that is fair, that we can address critical issues like climate change in a smart way.\" Obama has been outspoken in his support for his former vice president and told the New York Times in June that the Biden administration is \"finishing the job\" begun by the Obama presidency. Obama is set to attend the groundbreaking of the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago on Tuesday -- a presidential library in the historic Jackson Park neighborhood on Chicago\\'s South Side that will honor his legacy as the first Black president.

After almost 16 years as leader of Europe\\'s most powerful economy, Angela Merkel will be leaving the chancellorship behind as Germany votes on a new parliament. Merkel\\'s successor -- either her Christian Democratic Union appointee, Armin Laschet, or Olaf Scholz of the center-left Social Democrats -- will be determined only once a new government is formed. Sunday\\'s general election saw Scholz\\'s SPD win 25.7% of the vote, closely followed by the conservative CDU at 24.1%, according to official preliminary results released Monday morning. However, they alone don\\'t have the majority needed to rule and will have to form strategic coalitions that will determine who will govern the country. It\\'s historically rare in German politics that the make-up of a leading coalition and identity of the next chancellor is so unclear. Despite Merkel\\'s popularity, her CDU struggled to galvanize the conservative party\\'s traditional base under Laschet, the governor of Germany\\'s North Rhine-Westphalia state. Laschet was gaffe-laden during the campaign, including being caught on camera laughing during a tribute to those who died in the devastating floods in West Germany in July. Even on voting day, Laschet made a blunder by folding his ballot the wrong way -- making his voting choice visible, which could make his vote invalid. Climate change has played a central role during the election race. The environmentalist Greens gained more support than anticipated early on. It could take weeks -- if not months -- of negotiations between the parties before a coalition government is fully formed. Dr. Ursula Munch from Germany\\'s Academy of Political Education predicts the transition period to be drawn out. \"Many in Germany are speculating that Merkel might still have to hold the New Years\\' speech,\" Munch told ABC News. One thing is certain: Merkel\\'s exit will mark the end of an era. In her last few weeks, Germans are reflecting on the legacy that she leaves behind. \"Angela Merkel became chancellor when I was 14 years old,\" 30-year-old German citizen Svenja Beck told ABC News. \"I can hardly remember anyone other than a woman ever ruling our country. It feels crazy that this era is coming to an end. In any case, I hope she can enjoy her well-deserved retirement, especially after these exhausting 1.5 years.\" Indeed, there\\'s a sense of nostalgia in some young Germans who have only known a country led by the leader known as \"mutti,\" or mother. After three terms as chancellor, Merkel is still a popular figure. Last week a survey by Gallup research recorded her approval rating at 71%. Many Germans have admired her demeanor -- an assuring confidence, a pragmatism -- others have been assured by her steady economic policies that have enabled the country to weather several crises. She\\'s also been valued for her ability to reach consensus across governments and political persuasions. \"Merkel\\'s personal style has left certain marks,\" Munch said. \"Her rather restrained, unpretentious and matter-of-fact nature does seem to be popular among a large part of the population.\" Beyond that, Munch considers Merkel\\'s legacy to be defined by her crisis management and ability to deal with adverse situations \"step by step.\" Munch noted that while Merkel may approach potential conflicts with hesitation at first, she\\'ll quickly and thoroughly deal with them once she\\'s in the thick of it. \"We saw this with the banking crisis, with the Euro rescue, during the refugee crisis and now in particular with the coronavirus,\" she added. But throughout the years, Merkel has received criticism for being too complacent on certain fronts, with environmentalists being particularly vocal in accusing her of not doing enough to tackle climate change. German citizen Steffen Mechlinski, who voted for the Greens on Sunday, said he\\'s looking forward to some issues getting more attention under the new leadership: \"After 16 solid years, I am now hoping for an ambitious policy approach, particularly when it comes to climate change, social justice, education and digitalization,\" Mechlinski told ABC News. Internationally, Merkel has enjoyed widespread popularity. \"She\\'s considered to be a very dependable person in many parts of the world,\" Munch said, \"although I\\'m sure that some eastern European and southeastern European states may not agree.\" However, it\\'s Merkel\\'s willingness to involve everyone, including smaller states, in policy debates and decisions that gives her a reputation for fairness and dependability. Munch doesn\\'t foresee any dramatic changes to Germany\\'s foreign policy. \"The CDU and the SPD are really not that different from each other,\" she said. \"Both are transatlantically oriented parties. Both -- including the SPD under Olaf Scholz -- keep Russia at a distance and approach China with reservations.\" Even the Greens, who will form part of the new government, won\\'t dramatically impact the direction of Germany\\'s foreign policy, particularly when it comes to the United States. \"All three parties are transatlantics,\" Munch added. \"These are all people and parties who care a lot about German-American relations.\" In her years as chancellor, Merkel has resisted taking a tougher stance on China, with trade between the two countries booming. Munch doesn\\'t expect doesn\\'t anticipate dramatic changes toward China, saying that even the Greens must conduct a business-friendly policy. \"Perhaps, when it comes to China, the priority won\\'t just be foreign trade,\" she said, \"but that the approach will be more cautious, especially with regards to human rights policies.\"\\nNBA\\'s Andrew Wiggins gets vaccine after he\\'s denied exemption Andrew Wiggins, an NBA player who has vocally opposed the COVID-19 vaccine, just received a dose, according to his coach. Wiggins, of the Golden State Warriors, refused to answer reporters\\' questions about his vaccination status during a news conference last Monday. \"It\\'s my problem...Not yours,\" he said. But Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters Sunday that the 26-year-old did get vaccinated. \"He just told me today that he was fine with us acknowledging it,\" Kerr said. Kerr didn\\'t provide any more details including which vaccine Wiggins received. The San Francisco Department of Public Health bars unvaccinated residents over the age of 12 from attending indoor events. The rule goes into effect for employees of indoor businesses on Oct. 13, eight days before the Warriors\\' home opener. Wiggins applied for a religious exemption with the NBA, but his request was denied, ESPN reported\\nCongress now has just days to cobble together a government funding bill. Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic measure aimed at averting a government shutdown and raising the federal debt limit Monday evening, leaving Congress with just days to cobble together a government funding bill. The Senate voted 48-50, with Democrats falling short of the 60 votes needed to stop the Republican filibuster. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer changed his vote at the last minute, he said, in order to potentially reconsider the measure. GOP senators \"voted to drive our country straight toward a government shutdown and the first default in our countrys history,\" Schumer said. The measure would have extended federal funding at the current levels through early December and would have provided billions in emergency relief funds for Afghan refugee resettlement and Hurricane Ida relief. It also would have raised the federal debt limit through December 2022. Before the vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had tried to get the Senate to pass his own government funding bill stripped of a debt ceiling hike, but Democrats objected. GOP Sen. John Kennedy, whose state was ravaged by multiple hurricanes, had called on Democratic senators to set aside the debt ceiling fight and pass the McConnell bill. \"Why are we fighting over this? You know, nature abhors a moron, and its moronic not to pass this,\" he said. \"Let\\'s not be moronic.\" Kennedy had been the lone Republican to toy with voting yes on the Democrats\\' measure, bucking McConnell. But in the end, he stayed with his conference. The debt limit must be dealt with by mid-October if lawmakers hope to avert potential financial calamity. Experts warn that failure to act could lead to the stock market crashing, rising rates for mortgages, loans and credit cards, and businesses finding it more expensive to do basic business, leading to layoffs. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen put it in stark terms in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, saying, \"In a matter of days, millions of Americans could be strapped for cash.\" \"Nearly 50 million seniors could stop receiving Social Security checks for a time,\" she wrote. \"Troops could go unpaid. Millions of families who rely on the monthly child tax credit could see delays.\" But Republicans were united in their resolve to block any hike to the debt limit from moving forward, denying Democrats the 60 votes necessary to move forward on a stopgap funding bill because it would raise the debt limit. Schumer scolded Republicans on Monday before the vote for signaling they wont come together to vote yes on the continuing resolution, calling their refusal \"unhinged\" and \"radical.\" \"There is no scenario on God\\'s green Earth where it should be worth risking millions of jobs, trillions in household wealth, people\\'s social security checks, veterans benefits and another recession, just to score short-term meaningless political points,\" Schumer said. \"We\\'re facing a parade of horrible that will hurt every single American in this country,\" he added. McConnell argued Republicans have been transparent for weeks that they would not support a continuing resolution that raises the debt ceiling. \"We will support a clean continuing resolution that will prevent a government shutdown, get disaster relief to Louisiana, help properly vetted Afghan refugees who put themselves on the line for America and support the Iron Dome assistance for our ally, Israel,\" McConnell said. \"We will not provide Republican votes for raising the debt limit.\" McConnell has argued that Democrats can and should be responsible for raising the debt limit on their own to offset the cost of a not-yet-passed massive social spending bill that encompasses many of President Joe Biden\\'s agenda items. That social spending bill is exempt from the normal 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Democrats can pass it without any GOP support, and a raise in the debt limit should be tied to that bill, Republicans argue. \"My advice to this Democratic government, the president, the House and the Senate: Don\\'t play Russian roulette with our economy. Step up and raise the debt ceiling to cover all that you\\'ve been engaged in all year long,\" McConnell said last week. \"This is a totally Democratic government. They have an obligation to raise the debt ceiling, and they will do it.\" But raising the debt limit is traditionally a bipartisan objective. Senate Democrats have cried foul, alleging that McConnell is being inconsistent in his position. Democrats worked with Republicans under the Trump administration to raise the debt limit on multiple occasions, and the limit now needs to be raised largely to pay for legislation passed during the Trump presidency. New proposals from the Biden administration haven\\'t yet been factored in. \"For Republicans to suddenly throw their hands in the air and abscond from their responsibility to pay debt that they proudly supported is nothing short of a dine and dash of historic proportions,\" Schumer said last week. \"Republicans wracked trillions of dollars in debt under President Trump and are demanding American families foot the bill.\" It\\'s not clear exactly how the Senate might proceed in the coming days to stop a shutdown. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested last week that Congress would likely consider a stopgap funding measure that does not impact the debt limit, buying lawmakers more time to strategize on how to proceed. McConnell said Republicans would support this. But the clock is ticking. Democrats must address both the debt limit and government funding in the coming weeks while simultaneously juggling the fate of many of Biden\\'s most ambitious domestic policy priorities. Without the 60 votes necessary to advance a debt limit hike in the Senate, lawmakers have little choice but to include it in their massive $3.5 trillion social spending bill -- but that bill\\'s fate is anything but certain. In the House, moderates are threatening to withhold votes unless a separate $1 trillion infrastructure bill that passed the Senate in August clears the lower chamber. The House is expected to vote on the bipartisan bill later this week, but progressives want to see more progression the larger social bill before they lend their support to it. Biden addressed the big week on Capitol Hill while receiving his booster shot earlier Monday. \"We\\'ve got three things to do: the debt ceiling, continuing resolution and the two pieces of legislation. We do that, the country is going to be in great shape,\" Biden told reporters. Echoing the president at a briefing Monday afternoon, White House press secretary Jen Psaki indicated congressional negotiations could stretch beyond this week. \"You said it could go into next week? That\\'s your expectations?\" one reporter asked. \"Well see,\" Psaki replied.\\nShe may move forward regardless of negotiations on the larger policy package. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately rallied Democrats in a caucus meeting Monday evening as the House began debate over the bipartisan infrastructure package. Pelosi signaled she plans to push forward with a Thursday vote on the Senate\\'s bipartisan infrastructure bill, regardless of the status of negotiations on the larger Democratic policy package with the Senate. Members believe it\\'s an attempt to pressure key senators to reach an agreement on the social spending plan, and some remain skeptical that the package will be ironed out with the backing of enough Democrats to clear the chamber by then. Pelosi\\'s announcement to Democrats was a reversal of her earlier pledge to move both pieces of legislation together. It\\'s also a test of progressives\\' vow to block the Senate-passed legislation unless it\\'s paired with the social spending package. President Joe Biden and White House press secretary Jen Psaki both indicated earlier Monday afternoon that negotiations could stretch beyond this week. \"What we\\'re focused on right now is working in lockstep with leadership to move the agenda forward and get it over the finish line,\" Psaki said in a briefing, adding, \"Well see,\" when asked if it could go into next week. On the other side of Capitol Hill, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia did not share the House\\'s urgency on the social spending package, eschewing progressive threats to tank the bipartisan infrastructure bill Manchin co-authored without a deal certain on the larger social and economic spending package. \"I don\\'t do really good on threats,\" Manchin told reporters. \"I\\'ll guarantee you this: The infrastructure bill will be passed before November 2022, before the election.\" Biden spoke on the phone with Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday afternoon before they both met with their respective Democratic colleagues to discuss the infrastructure package, the larger economic plan and avoiding a U.S. default, according to the White House. The White House said the leaders \"covered the outreach that each of the three are doing to Democratic House and Senate members\" on the two big bills that represent much of Bidens domestic priorities, though more specific details about that outreach were not provided. Biden, Pelosi and Schumer \"will continue their close coordination over the coming days,\" the White House said. Pelosi also privately told House members that Biden is negotiating directly with senators over the overall price tag of the reconciliation package. \"We just have to make difficult choices,\" she said during the Monday evening caucus meeting. \"But we\\'re still waiting for the number because you cannot prove the design on the legislation without the number. And the president is working on that piece. Hes working on that piece.\" The speaker indicated that she and Schumer are \"completely in sync\" and plan to have the same bill. \"We are not going to pass a bill that cannot pass - that wont pass the Senate,\" Pelosi told caucus members. \"And that\\'s why we have to come up with a number. But we\\'re not there yet.\" However, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., told reporters that figure is less important than making sure their \"priorities\" are addressed. \"It\\'s about the priorities that are getting funded and specific policies we put forth,\" Omar said. Democrats will continue working behind the scenes to reach an agreement with Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., on a range of different issues from climate change to the size and scope of the education and medical programs in the package, as well as who will be impacted by the tax law changes. \"We can\\'t have a situation where the Senate doesn\\'t agree with us, or we leave some issues off the table,\" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said. \"The whole bill needs to be agreed upon, written, etc.\" Some Republicans did signal plans to vote with Democrats on the package -- \"This is a working piece of legislation that will build, put people to work,\" Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, the dean of the House, said -- others spoke out against it, despite it being negotiated by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate. \"It\\'s a facade to lure everyone into opening the door for Speaker Pelosi\\'s real priority: a $3.5 trillion tax and spend plan,\" Republican Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri, the top Republican on the House Transportation Committee, said.\\nAhead of Tuesday\\'s groundbreaking on the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago, former President Barack Obama reflected on the center\\'s mission and defended his decision to choose the historic Jackson Park neighborhood on Chicago\\'s South Side as the site to honor his legacy. Some community organizers have expressed concern that development of the center, which would become a tourist attraction, could lead to gentrification of the neighborhood, while park preservationists have challenged the construction in court, citing environmental concerns. \"The truth is, any time you do a big project, unless you\\'re in the middle of a field somewhere, you know, and it\\'s on private property, there\\'s always going to be some people who say, \\'Well, but we don\\'t want change. We\\'re worried about it. We don\\'t know how it\\'s going to turn out,\\'\" Obama told Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts in an exclusive interview. \"Which is why we\\'ve gone through such an exhaustive process to encourage and elicit comments and concerns and criticism and suggestions from the community.\" Jackson Park is a public park on the National Register of Historic Places that was designed by New York Central Park designer Frederick Law Olmsted. A four-year federal review, which concluded in February, determined that the new Obama Center would pose \"no significant impact to the human environment.\" But Protect Our Parks, a nonprofit park preservationist organization that filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to block construction in 2018, filed another lawsuit in April challenging the federal review. The group argued that construction \"will tear up this Frederick Law Olmsted masterpiece,\" resulting in the removal of trees, the removal of the Women\\'s Garden and the closure of roadways. On Aug. 21 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal by the group to block construction. Amid ongoing litigation, Protect Our Parks on Sept. 20 filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Seventh Circuit in support of its preliminary injunction request, the group told ABC News. Monday, on the eve of the groundbreaking, a spokesperson for the group released a statement saying that \"the homecoming of the former President and the First Lady should be a moment of pride for Chicagoans. On this visit, though, we hope they will mourn the devastation of the initial clear-cutting of the mature trees and the destruction of the Women\\'s Garden in Jackson Park, in addition to the long-term environmental and public health dangers that will ensue.\" \"Unfortunately, hosting a series of virtual groundbreakings will not change the facts of the case or the long-term adverse effects on the community,\" the statement said. \"On the contrary, it would take one decision by Mr. and Mrs. Obama to relocate the OPC site to the adjacent area close to Washington Park.\" Asked about the legal hurdles, Obama said that he\\'s \"absolutely confident\" that the center will benefit the local community. \"The overwhelming majority of the community has been not just OK with it, but are hugely enthusiastic about it,\" he told Roberts. Presidential libraries are often housed in affluent areas, but much of Chicago\\'s South Side, which is home to a predominantly Black community, is in an underserved and economically depressed area of the city. The Obama Presidential Center, which will honor the legacy of the first Black president, will include a library, museum, gardens, and a children\\'s playground. Organizers say it will seek to bring investments and jobs to the community. \"The Obama Presidential Center will connect the economy of the South Side of Chicago with the rest of the city, creating new jobs and opportunities. It will breathe new life into a park that has long been protected and loved, but underused. And it will uphold our commitment to this vibrant community,\" according to the Obama Foundation, which is funding the project. Obama was born in Hawaii but spent much of his formative years on Chicago\\'s South Side. It was there that he worked as a community organizer and was first elected to public office. The former president decided in 2016 that the South Side, where is also where former first lady Michelle Obama grew up, would house his presidential library. \"The young person who\\'s growing up across the street or down the block or a few miles away, now suddenly have a place where concerts and speeches and debates and forums are taking place that they can access,\" Obama said. \"If they want to bring about change in their neighborhoods, they\\'ve got resources and people who can teach them how to do that effectively. And they\\'re going to be able to see themselves as part of that change in a way that, so often, they don\\'t feel right now.\" The Obamas, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker are set to attend Tuesday\\'s groundbreaking. ABC News\\' Rick Klein, Katie Bosland, Mya Green and Danielle Genet contributed to this report.\\nGen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pushed back strongly Tuesday on recent characterizations of his phone calls to China\\'s top military official and denied that he had placed himself in the chain of command for nuclear launch protocols following a phone call from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \"My loyalty to this nation, its people, and the Constitution hasnt changed and will never change as long as I have a breath to give, My loyalty is absolute, and I will not turn my back on the fallen,\" Milley told the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"The calls on 30 October and 8 January were coordinated before and after with Secretary Esper and Acting Secretary Millers staffs and the interagency,\" he told the committee. \"The specific purpose of the October and January calls was generated by concerning intelligence which caused us to believe the Chinese were worried about an attack on them by the U.S. Milley\\'s phone calls were first made public in the new book \"Peril\" by the Washington Post\\'s Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. \"I know, I am certain, that President Trump did not intend on attacking the Chinese and it was my directed responsibility by the secretary to convey that intent to the Chinese,\" said Milley. \"My task at that time was to de-escalate. My message again was consistent: calm, steady: De-escalate. We are not going to attack you.\" \"At Secretary of Defense Espers direction, I made a call to General Li on 30 October. Eight people sat in the call with me, and I read out the call within 30 minutes of the call ending,\" he said. ABC News had previously reported that former Defense Secretary Mark Esper had directed Milley to contact his Chinese counterpart as part of a coordinated effort after the U.S. intelligence reports emerged suggesting China\\'s concerns about a military strike. Milley added that the second call on January 8 was prompted by a Chinese request for him to call again that had been made on December 31, 2020 \"Eleven people attended the call with me. Read-outs of this call were distributed to the interagency that same day,\" he said. \"Shortly after my call ended with General Li, I informed both Secretary of State Pompeo and White House chief of staff Meadows about the call among other topics. Soon after that, I attended a meeting with Acting Secretary Miller where I briefed him on the call.\" Milley also explained how later that day he received a call from Pelosi inquiring \"about the presidents ability to launch nuclear weapons. I sought to assure her that nuclear launch is governed by a very specific and deliberate process.\" \"She was concerned and made various personal references characterizing the president,\" said Milley. \"I explained that the president is the sole nuclear launch authority and he doesnt launch them alone. And that I am not qualified to determine the mental health of the president of the United States. \"There are processes, protocols, and procedures in place and I repeatedly assured her there is no chance of an illegal, unauthorized, or accidental launch,\" he told the committee. After the phone call Milley said he met with key staffers \"to refresh all of us on these procedures, which we practice daily at the action officer level. \" He rejected criticism of that meeting that he was placing himself in the chain of command for nuclear attack protocols. \"At no time was I attempting to change or influence the process, usurp authority, or insert myself into the chain of command, but I am expected to give my advice and ensure that the president is fully informed on military matters,\" said Milley. He told the committee that after his staff meeting he notified Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller about Pelosi\\'s calls.\\nProgressive Democrats on Tuesday starkly warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other party leaders that their position on President Joe Biden\\'s infrastructure agenda remains unchanged: Without a deal on a broader, social policy bill, they do not intend to support a bipartisan infrastructure bill that Pelosi wants to bring to a vote this Thursday. \"We articulated this position more than three months ago, and today it is still unchanged: progressives will vote for both bills, but a majority of our members will only vote for the infrastructure bill after the Presidents visionary Build Back Better Act passes,\" Congressional Progressive Caucus chairwoman Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said in a statement. \"This agenda is not some fringe wish list: it is the Presidents agenda, the Democratic agenda, and what we all promised voters when they delivered us the House, Senate, and White House,\" she said. \"As our members have made clear for three months, the two are integrally tied together, and we will only vote for the infrastructure bill after passing the reconciliation bill,\" she added. Jayapal has previously noted that more than 60 members of the nearly 100-member caucus will vote no on the bipartisan bill if it is not passed in tandem with the $3.5 trillion social policy bill. Shortly afterward, Sen. Bernie Sanders, in a tweet, urged progressives to vote down the bill Biden and Pelosi want passed, saying \"I strongly urge my House colleagues to vote against the bipartisan infrastructure bill until Congress passes a strong reconciliation bill.\" Between Tuesday\\'s warnings from Democrats and Republicans planning to withhold any \"yes\" votes Thursday in hopes of ensuring a Democratic defeat, Pelosi might be forced to change plans. Moderates have insisted for weeks they want a vote on the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that cleared the Senate last month. Pelosi privately rallied Democrats in a caucus meeting Monday evening, signaling she plans to push forward with a Thursday vote on the Senate\\'s bipartisan infrastructure bill, regardless of the status of negotiations on the larger Democratic policy package with the Senate. Pelosi\\'s announcement to Democrats was a reversal of her earlier pledge to move both pieces of legislation together. Pelosi and her leadership team have been working furiously behind the scenes under intense pressure to strike a delicate compromise between both factions. Moments after progressives sent out their latest warning Tuesday, Pelosi refused to comment on what she intends to do, given that the bill will fail on the floor Thursday without progressives support. \"Im not having that conversation right now,\" Pelosi told reporters. In a dear colleague letter sent Tuesday afternoon, Pelosi suggested Biden was taking the lead on negotiation efforts. \"As I write this to you, negotiations are being led by President Biden to advance his vision. The President takes a pride in his agenda, which is shared overwhelmingly by House and Senate Democrats, which creates jobs, gives tax cuts for the middle class, lowers costs for health care and is paid by making the wealthiest few and big corporations pay their fair share,\" Pelosi said in the letter. At issue is the lack of a topline number on the broader, social spending bill. The $3.5 trillion bill includes significant new investments in health care, child care, higher education, workforce training, and paid family and medical leave which would include 12 weeks paid family and medical leave for most working Americans. But moderate Democrats, including Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have made clear the price tag needs to be much lower if they are to support it. Manchin and Sinema both met separately with Biden at the White House Tuesday. Pelosi made clear to reporters ahead of those meetings that in order for progress to be made on the reconciliation bill, senators like Manchin and Sinema must first indicate how much spending they are willing to support. \"So in the next day or so, we hope to come to a place where we can move forward on that,\" Pelosi told reporters. Pelosi added that she wants the reconciliation bill done before Biden jets off to Glasgow in November, so he can tout the climate provisions in the bill. \"We want the president to be able to go there with a plan to meet our missions, promises and standards as well as our commitments to foreign nations for the technology to help meet their standards, as well. So, it\\'s a pretty exciting time. It\\'s a very big agenda. And it is transformative,\" she said. House Democratic caucus chairman Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats are taking it \"one day at a time\" and couldn\\'t say that the bipartisan plan will pass by Thursday, given the opposition from progressives.\\nShe said said the U.S. could run out of money by Oct. 18. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday that if Congress doesn\\'t raise the debt ceiling by the deadline it would be a \"calamity.\" Testifying before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs alongside Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Yellen said the U.S. could hit its debt limit in less than three weeks, as early as Oct. 18. \"This would be a manufactured crisis we had imposed on this country, which has been going through a very difficult period and is on the road to recovery,\" she said. \"This would be a self-inflicted wound of enormous proportions.\" The United States has never defaulted on its debt. Congress has voted 80 times to raise or suspend the debt limit since 1960. Yellen has previously laid out the consequences to lawmakers of missing the deadline. She has said nearly 50 million seniors could temporarily stop receiving Social Security payments, troops could go unpaid and millions of families who receive the monthly child tax credit could experience delays. A default could also trigger a spike in interest rates and result in a steep drop in stock prices and other financial turmoil, reversing the current economic recovery into a recession, with billions of dollars of growth and millions of jobs lost. Yellen painted a grim picture again Tuesday. Even if Congress increases the debt limit but does so too close to the deadline, it could cause economic fallout, Yellen said. \"Furthermore, we know from previous debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise borrowing costs for taxpayers and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States for years to come. Failure to act promptly could also result in substantial disruptions to financial markets, as heightened uncertainty can exacerbate volatility and erode investor confidence,\" Yellen outlined in a letter to congressional leadership. Yellen also reiterated that raising the debt limit has nothing to do with future government spending -- a point some Republicans have tried to push as reason for not supporting a debt-limit hike as Democrats on the Hill scramble to try to pass both a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a larger social spending package. \"I want to see that the debt ceiling is raised. I believe that it would be catastrophic not to do so. But I equally believe that deficits have been under both Democratic and Republican administrations, its important to recognize that, and that means paying the bills for those deficits is a shared responsibility,\" Yellen testified. ABC News\\' Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott contributed to this report.\\nThe magic is calling all Foodies to the Walt Disney World Resort 50th anniversary celebration - The Worlds Most Magical Celebration! Throughout our four theme parks and beyond, Disney chefs and mixologists have created more than 150 sips and bites full of color, whimsy, and a touch of EARidescent shimmer - with even more coming throughout the 18-month celebration beginning Oct. 1. Walts personal recipes, Walt Disney World Resort attractions (past and present), beloved Disney Characters, and nostalgic dishes from 1971 were inspirations for the tasty offerings created for this anniversary celebration. Walts palate was relatively simple - definitely a meat and potatoes guy! Roast lamb, roast beef hash topped with a fried egg, chili, and fried chicken were his favorites, along with lemon, apple, chocolate, and bread pudding desserts. Disney chefs looked to Walts recipes from the archives while planning for the 50th anniversary celebration. The result is deliciously reimagined versions of Walts favorites. And many of the treats (including the fun EARidescent Sip-a-bration) are infused with EARidescent shimmers to add glimmering touches to the celebratory creations.

Oscar proves that taking the extra step to put a smile on someones face is worth all the magic in the world. So, we wanted to celebrate this Disney Magic Maker in an extra special way. Oscar Cabrera of Burbank, CA goes out of his way to help everyone he runs into. According to his daughters, if Oscar sees someone selling something on the street, he stops and buys. Rather than doing away with old clothes, he donates them all to local shelters. And if the wait staff at his favorite restaurant is in need, he will find a way to help them out. On his last trip to Mexico, he met a family whose daughter had a cleft lip. Wanting to do all he could, he got in contact with Project Smile to help with her surgery and even went as far as to pay for the familys hotel accommodations and transport to the surgery. To show just how deserving this Disney Magic Maker is, we teamed up with influencer Brent Rivera to craft a magical surprise for Oscar. Check out the video below: To recognize the magic Oscar brings to others, he will enjoy a trip to Walt Disney World Resort to celebrate \"The Worlds Most Magical Celebration\" and may win a one-year subscription to Disney+.

Sarah Michelle Gellar slayed alongside Vampire Mater in Cars Land at Disney California Adventure park where Mater, Lightning McQueen, Cruz, Red and the residents of Cars Land have transformed the town of Radiator Springs into \"Radiator Screams.\" Its awesome! Aside from enjoying seeing the Cars in their \"car-stumes,\" I really love checking out all of the details in the land this time of year, where car parts, tools, parking cones and more have transformed into popular Halloween spooky decor. Its also a blast taking a spin on popular Cars Land attractions that rev up with Halloween spirit. Also at Disney California Adventure park, Actress Eiza Gonzalez shared a sweet moment with Miguel and the cast of \"A Musical Celebration of Coco,\" in between shows at Plaza de la Familia. Plaza de la Familia comes to life with folklorico dancers, Mariachi musicians, delicious food, interactive experiences and \"A Musical Celebration of Coco.\" Storytellers of Plaza de la Familia bring to life the story, songs and themes from the beloved film \"Coco.\" Youve gotta check out this colorful festival; I also highly recommend ordering the tamale plate at Paradise Garden Grill! At Disneyland park, we caught up with Jonathan Scott and Zooey Deschanel at the steps of the Disneyland Railroad train station on Main Street, U.S.A., where Goofy, Donald and Pluto stopped by donning their Halloween finest. I like strolling by here often as you never know who may pop by. There are, of course, other characters throughout the park, including some of my favorite villains! Just a few steps away, the couple also posed for a photo at the Mickey Mouse jack-o-lantern, aka, the most photographed spot during Halloween Time in the entire Disneyland Resort! The jack-o-lantern is quite the centerpiece of the Main Street Pumpkin Festival which transforms Main Street, U.S.A., with whimsical pumpkins displayed all throughout. Another awesome photo location is the exterior of Haunted Mansion Holiday, which features a merry makeover of the beloved eerie estate. Jack Skellington is behind the mayhem, decorating the mansion with frightfully festive touches inspired by \"Tim Burtons The Nightmare Before Christmas.\" Theres magic everywhere. Its so hard to pick a favorite!

Walt Disney himself was absolutely fascinated by the technology of his day, and by the possibilities it represented for the movie and theme park industries. He invented the multi-plane camera and used Technicolor in his animated films ... then moved on to create Audio-Animatronics figures for Disneyland shows like \"Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln\" and \"Walt Disneys Enchanted Tiki Room.\" That was just the beginning, and Walts curiosity, imagination and ingenuity set the stage for the decades of invention and discovery that have followed. Today at Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, we continue to innovate by inventing and investing in technology and embracing what it can mean to a Disney experience - seamlessly integrating the physical, digital and virtual worlds to help you navigate our properties and platforms, immerse yourself in our stories, connect with those you love and share your unforgettable experiences with the world. Over the past few years, our Imagineers have developed amazing technology for attractions such as Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance and the Spider-Man acrobatic robot that soars above Avengers Campus in Disney California Adventure park. You may have also caught a glimpse of what they are working on for future experiences, including a \"real\" lightsaber that will debut at Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World Resort, a free-roaming Groot robotic character, or a full-sized exoskeleton that may one day bring our larger characters to life in ways you never thought possible. Sometimes this technology takes center stage and inspires a sense of awe, while other times it plays a supporting role, all but invisible behind the scenes ... but its always there, helping our cast, crew, employees and Imagineers make magic. To bring a little more magic to your in-home Alexa experience, were announcing the availability of a new Mickey-inspired stand for Echo Show 5. This OtterBox Den Series case brings the fun of Disney to your home with a playfully designed stand. As we kick off the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World Resort, were excited about the ways that technology will add to our celebration - and beyond. Today we announced a project with Amazon called \"Hey, Disney!\" With it, weve created our own custom assistant, using Disney stories, characters and more - all built on Amazons Alexa technology. Whether youre at home or in one of our Walt Disney World Resort hotel rooms, soon youll be able to use an Echo device to interact with your favorite Disney, Pixar or Star Wars characters. \"Hey, Disney!\" will make your vacation easier, more meaningful and more fun ... and it will entertain and delight you when youre at home, too. It raises the bar for immersive storytelling with authentic character voices, unique audio environments inspired by our films and destinations, and more than a thousand magical interactions to discover - so you can expect a few surprises! Well have more to share soon about \"Hey, Disney!\" and other ways that technology and innovation will continue to help us make magic and create the Disney Difference - setting ourselves apart in the world of dream vacations, renowned family entertainment, and innovative products and experiences around the world. Just like Walt, all of us at Disney today think its kind of fun to do the impossible. Our curiosity and imagination are always working overtime, inspiring us with dreams of what could be and where well go next. Technology opens new doors every day, presenting us with endless possibilities and an ever-evolving vision of the future. I hope youll come along for the ride - were just getting started.\\nAs a first-generation Cuban American growing up in a multi-generational household, Frank Vega helped his mother and grandmother in the kitchen from a young age where he learned how to cook traditional Cuban meals. Eventually, Frank discovered that cooking was his passion, so he enrolled in culinary school and set his sights at working at Walt Disney World Resort. Frank began his Disney journey at Disneys BoardWalk Inn, where he prepared Mediterranean-style meals, something new and different for him. While the flavors were similar to the Cuban cuisine he was used to making at home, Frank found the experience of crafting dishes outside his Cuban culture to be enlightening and rewarding. \"Being a chef is a perfect way for me to share my Cuban heritage,\" Frank said. \"Food has always had a special meaning to me, and sharing unique flavors with my fellow cast members and guests is truly an honor.\" After 18 years at Disney, Frank has worked in many locations across the resort and continues learning something new from each team. Now, as a sous chef at Disneys Hollywood Studios, Frank brings together his culinary skills and background to work every day by inventing new menu items for quick service restaurants across property. His latest creation, a Columbian Hot Dog found at Fairfax Fare at Disneys Hollywood Studios, is one of the special culinary delights available for visitors in honor of Hispanic Latinx Heritage Month now through Oct. 15. This unique take on a hot dog is topped with pineapple mustard slaw, drizzled with garlic cilantro \"mayoketchup\" (a fusion between ketchup and mayonnaise) and topped with crispy potatoes. Inspired by his hometown of Miami, the dish pays homage to the restaurants Frank visited as a child. \"We really dont have boundaries when developing new recipes; we can be as creative as we want.\" Having more diverse and unique menu options, like the Colombian Hot Dog, is one way Frank hopes to spark curiosity and connect in our guests to different cultures. \"Food brings us closer together,\" Frank stated. \"It brings out stories of tradition and heritage that unite us all in a fun and exciting way.\" Visit the resort to try this and other dishes as part Walt Disney Worlds \"Together We Are Magia\" celebration across property.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOver one month into Taliban control of Afghanistan, fears for women\\'s and girl\\'s rights and education have only grown -- fueled further Tuesday by a top Taliban official\\'s comments that \"women will not be allowed to come to universities or work.\" It\\'s a strange episode that says as much about the Taliban\\'s acute awareness of international perceptions as it does about what the future of Taliban rule holds for half of Afghanistan\\'s nearly 40 million people -- its women and girls. While the U.S. and other Western countries have called on the Taliban to respect women\\'s and girls\\' rights, especially access to education, the Taliban have already taken steps to restrict them, including announcing earlier this month that certain subjects may be off limits and female students would be barred from studying with males. That could mean they\\'ll be excluded entirely, given the limited resources at Afghanistan\\'s schools and universities. Already, the militant group has named an all-male Cabinet and prohibited women from returning to work, saying there were security concerns that temporarily prevented it. A handful of women-led protests against Taliban rules have faced violent crackdowns in Kabul and other cities. When the Taliban controlled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, they largely barred women and girls from public life without a male relative and excluded them from schools and universities entirely. Kabul University chancellor Mohammad Ashraf Ghairat suggested a return to that policy Tuesday, tweeting, \"As long as a real Islamic environment is not provided for all, women will not be allowed to come to universities or work. Islam first.\" After media outlets reported on his comments, he issued a second tweet, criticizing the New York Times in particular for what he called a \"bad misunderstanding\" of his comments. \"I haven\\'t said that we will never allow women to attend universities or go to work, I meant that until we create an Islamic environment, women will have to stay at home. We work hard to create safe Islamic environment soon,\" wrote the 34-year old, who was named to his role earlier this month. Hours later, his Twitter account was deleted entirely. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban\\'s chief spokesperson, spun Ghairat\\'s statement, seemingly keen to ease Western concerns about women\\'s education, even without denying it was true. \"It might be his own personal view,\" Mujahid told the New York Times, according to the paper, which added that he would not give assurances about when the ban on women would be lifted. He only said the militant group was working on a \"safer transportation system and an environment where female students are protected.\" Asked about Ghairat\\'s comments, a State Department spokesperson told ABC News, \"Any government should demonstrate respect for and inclusion of women and girls, in all their diversity, including supporting their education. Equal access to higher education on the basis of merit for all individuals is one of the principles codified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\" But it\\'s unclear what steps the U.S. or other government would be willing to take to ensure that equal access. The spokesperson didn\\'t address that issue, saying instead in their statement the U.S. \"will continue to support Afghan women and girls.\" The Taliban is already under heavy international sanctions, and the former Afghan government\\'s U.S. assets, worth billions of dollars, remain frozen by the U.S., while the World Bank and International Monetary Fund suspended funding. There\\'s growing pressure from Taliban leaders as well as some Afghan civilians to release those funds as the country\\'s economy teeters on collapse and millions are desperate for international aid. \"We call on the international community, the World Bank and international humanitarian agencies not to suspend their humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Don\\'t leave Afghanistan alone in this difficult time,\" said teacher Aqela Noori at a news conference in Kabul Tuesday, according to the Associated Press. She was one of several female health workers, teachers and rights defenders who spoke to urge for resumed global aid, which accounts for some three-fourths of Afghanistan\\'s public expenditures, per the World Bank. Some 120,000 female educators and nearly 14,000 female health care workers have not been paid their salaries for the past two to three months, per Noori, who also urged Taliban leaders to find jobs for 16,000 female teachers prohibited by the militants from teaching high school, according to the AP. During the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, there were enormous gains for women and girls, especially in education. The female literacy rate nearly doubled in a decade to 30% in 2018, according to a UNESCO report this year, and the number of girls in school went from nearly zero in 2001 to 2.5 million in 2018, making up nearly half of all primary students.\\nFacebook\\'s safety head was questioned by lawmakers on Thursday over what the company knew about the potential for Instagram to be harmful to young users\\' mental health. The Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Data Security convened the hearing in the wake of a Wall Street Journal investigation citing Facebook\\'s own internal research, allegedly leaked by a whistleblower, that found Instagram adversely impacted mental health issues in teens, especially girls. Among the findings were that Instagram made body image issues worse for 1 in 3 teens. The Journal\\'s reporting has sparked a fierce backlash amid accusations the tech giant publicly downplayed what it knew about how potentially harmful Instagram could be while also doing nothing to prevent it. \"We\\'re here today because Facebook has shown us once again that it is incapable of holding itself accountable,\" Committee Chair Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in his opening remarks. \"This month, a whistleblower approached my office to provide information about Facebook and Instagram. Thanks to documents provided by that whistleblower, as well as extensive public reporting by The Wall Street Journal and others, we now have deep insight into Facebook\\'s relentless campaign to recruit and exploit young users.\" \"We now know that Facebook routinely puts profits ahead of kids\\' online safety,\" he added. \"We know it chooses the growth of its products over the well-being of our children, and we now know that it is in defensively delinquent in acting to protect them.\" In the wake of the Wall Street Journal expose, Facebook announced earlier this week that it was \"pausing\" development of an Instagram for Kids platform, but stopped short of scrapping it. Antigone Davis, Facebook\\'s global head of safety, faced bipartisan scrutiny as she defended the company during the hearing that lasted some three hours. She denied Blumenthal\\'s claims. \"We understand that recent reporting has raised a lot of questions about our internal research, including research we do to better understand young people\\'s experiences on Instagram,\" Davis stated in written testimony. \"We strongly disagree with how this reporting characterized our work, so we want to be clear about what that research shows, and what it does not show.\" \"We undertook this work to inform internal conversations about teens\\' most negative perceptions of Instagram,\" she added. \"It did not measure causal relationships between Instagram and real-world issues.\" Davis said the reporting \"implied that the results were surprising and that we hid this research,\" which she said wasn\\'t true and that the company has discussed the \"strengths and weaknesses of social media and well-being publicly for more than a decade.\" She also highlighted aspects of Facebook\\'s in-house research that she said the Journal didn\\'t include in recent stories, such as reports that Instagram made \"sadness\" and \"loneliness\" better for a majority of teenage girls. Davis said they have removed some 600,000 accounts on Instagram alone between June and August for not meeting the age requirement of 13 years old. She also said the company has \"put in place multiple protections to create safe and age-appropriate experiences for people between the ages of 13 and 17.\" The hearing comes as Big Tech has come under increased scrutiny from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over myriad issues, from allowing the spread of misinformation to allegations of political censorship. Lawmakers on Thursday compared Instagram\\'s policies to Big Tobacco\\'s previous tactics to attract users before there was government intervention. Brooke Erin Duffy, a professor of communication at Cornell University whose research focuses on the intersection of media, culture and technology, told ABC News via email on Thursday that Big Tech\\'s self-regulation hasn\\'t worked. Remarks from Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., referring to \"traditional media\\'s regulation of material for children -- including limitations on advertising that have long guided the television industry -- attest to a growing recognition that external regulation of the platforms is critical,\" Duffy said. \"While Big Tech has long flaunted its mechanisms of self-regulation, these have failed -- and continue to fail -- its users.\" Duffy said another key takeaway from Davis\\' testimony was \"a refusal to agree to a long-term promise to abandon plans of further developing Instagram for Kids.\" She called the initiative \"part of a long-term strategy by Big Tech to court younger -- and less witting -- users who the platforms can inevitably collect data from.\" Lawmakers on Thursday called for the need to update the 1998 Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act. In prepared remarks, Davis defended building an Instagram \"for tweens,\" noting that other companies such as YouTube and TikTok already have developed versions of their app for those under 13. \"The principle is the same: It\\'s much better for kids to use a safer, more age-appropriate version of social media apps than the alternative,\" Davis said. \"That said, we recognize how important it is to get this right.\" \"We have heard your concerns, and that is why we announced that we are pausing the project to take more time,\" she added. \"We\\'ll keep listening to parents, keep talking with policymakers and regulators, keep taking guidance from experts and researchers, and we\\'ll revisit this project at a later date.\"\\nThe stopgap funding bill made it to his desk just hours before the deadline. President Joe Biden on Thursday evening signed a deal the House and Senate passed earlier in the day to avert a government shutdown that would have affected hundreds of thousands of federal workers and slammed an economy still struggling to recover from the pandemic, all with just hours left to stave off a crisis. \"It meets critical and urgent needs of the nation,\" the president said in a statement Thursday night, but he also noted, \"Theres so much more to do.\" Under the deal, announced by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, senators dispensed with a handful of Republican amendments and then approved, 65-35, a temporary funding bill that not only averts a shutdown until Dec. 3, but also includes $28.6 billion in disaster aid for states ravaged by extreme weather and $6.3 billion to further assist Afghan refugees. The House passed the Senate version of the stopgap measure later Thursday afternoon, 254-175, just hours before the government technically runs out of money at the end of the day Thursday. According to the White House, H.R. 5305 -- the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act -- \"provides fiscal year 2022 appropriations to Federal agencies through December 3.\" The bill does not include any provision to raise the nation\\'s debt ceiling, after Republicans steadfastly rejected any attempt to include it. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has continued to insist that his conference will not help raise the borrowing limit -- or even expedite Democrats\\' ability to do so alone -- citing concerns about the majority party\\'s intention to pass trillions in new spending for social and climate policy. This, despite a debt ceiling increase paying for past, bipartisan debt. \"What Republicans laid out all along was a clean continuing resolution without the poison pill of a debt limit increase,\" McConnell said. \"That\\'s exactly what we\\'ll pass today.\" He said Democrats \"accepted reality,\" putting forward a \"clean\" continuing resolution to fund the government, and that \"the same thing will need to happen on the debt limit.\" Schumer said Republicans realized a shutdown would be \"catastrophic\" and \"they should realize that a default on the national debt would be even worse.\" He said the GOP have spent the week \"solidifying themselves as the party of default.\" Biden hinted at the discord in his statement on the continuing resolution Thursday evening, writing that \"the passage of this bill reminds us that bipartisan work is possible and it gives us time to pass longer-term funding to keep our government running and delivering for the American people.\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned of \"calamity\" for the economy and average Americans unless the debt limit is raised before Oct. 18. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., noted the irony of Republicans refusing to raise the borrowing limit but then voting to approve billions in new spending. \"If there\\'s no money in the treasury to pay for these items -- what\\'s the point?\" Leahy asked. McConnell, for his part, condemned Democrats for not including $1 billion in funding for Israel\\'s anti-missile Iron Dome system. Democrats in the House balked at funding, and the measure was stripped out in that chamber. But a majority of Democrats in both chambers have said they intend to pass the funding for a key U.S. ally at a later date.

A Dallas apartment building has partially collapsed after firefighters were called to investigate a carbon monoxide leak, according to officials. When firefighters arrived at the South Dallas apartment building around 10:30 a.m. local time, they noticed an odor of gas around the building, according to Dallas Fire-Rescue. An explosion occurred while fire crews were investigating the scene, causing the two-story building to partially collapse, officials said. The fire was producing flames and heavy smoke by 11 a.m., Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans told reporters in a news conference Wednesday afternoon. At least half of the building appeared to be badly damaged and piles of debris from the building could be seen strewn around the structure. \"The damage is extensive,\" Evans said. \"The collapse itself is extensive.\" Seven people, including four firefighters, were injured in the explosion and taken to local hospitals. Three firefighters are in critical condition; and the remaining victims are expected to be released from the hospital, according to Dallas Fire-Rescue. Residents began reporting the smell of gas as early as Tuesday night, Evans said. He did not elaborate on the initial investigation into those reports. It is unclear what caused the explosion, fire officials said. Additional information was not immediately available. ABC News\\' James Scholz contributed to this report.\\nConditions at New York Citys jail complex, Rikers Island, are so bad that Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance has directed prosecutors not to ask for bail in nonviolent crimes and when a defendants record does not demonstrate recent violence -- even if it risks an increase in additional \"low-level\" crime. The directive comes amid a spate of deaths and a culture of violence that have spurred calls for emergency action. The district attorneys office said the conditions at Rikers \"are of deep concern\" and \"will inform our bail practices for at least the next few weeks.\" \"We hope that the conditions on Rikers Island improve quickly,\" executive assistant district attorney Joan Illuzzi said in a memo obtained by ABC News. \"While we are duty bound to insure public safety, we are also aware that no one can avert their eyes from the conditions being reported at Rikers. In light of the conditions faced by those individuals detained at Rikers, we have endeavored to ensure that our practices are as equitable as possible, even though we understand that releasing some individuals may, unfortunately, lead to additional low level crime.\" In a follow-up email obtained by ABC News, assistant district attorney Andrew Warshawer said prosecutors won\\'t ask for monetary bail, for the time being, when: the crime is legally and factually nonviolent and doesn\\'t implicate risk of physical harm; and the defendant isn\\'t a violent felon and doesn\\'t have sex crimes or violent misdemeanor convictions within the last 10 years; and the defendant hasn\\'t failed to appear for the case. Warshawer said the office will still ask for supervised release and other non-cash conditions. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday, \"It has to be very, very carefully approached.\" \"There are some low-level offenses where -- Ive said this for a long time -- people do not belong in a jail setting. We can use supervised release, we can use a lot of other tools,\" he said. \"But when it particularly comes to anything regarding violent crime or serious crime, I would be very, very careful.\"\\nInvestigators said the victims deaths \"appeared to be suspicious.\" The mother and toddler who fell to their deaths at Petco Park before a Padres game in San Diego on Saturday have been identified. Police identified the victims as Raquel Wilkins, 40, and her 2-year-old son Denzel Browning-Wilkins, residents of San Diego. Detectives said the mother and son were at the dining and concession area on the third-floor concourse level of the stadium prior to falling to the sidewalk level below. However, cops have been tight-lipped on how the tragic fall unfolded. San Diego Police officers assigned to the baseball game were alerted that two people fell at 3:51 p.m. Saturday. Two officers arrived and found the bodies on the sidewalk and performed CPR on the two. \"Due to their traumatic injuries, both were pronounced deceased at the scene,\" San Diego Police said in a statement. Investigators said the victims deaths \"appeared to be suspicious.\" Police said the investigation is ongoing and detectives are still in the process of interviewing witnesses and attempting to locate evidence. \"How and why this happened are questions on the mind of many, especially the investigators looking for answers in this heartbreaking case,\" police said. \"Due to the large crowd present at the time of the incident, detectives have been interviewing numerous witnesses and more are coming forward,\" police said. Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to call the Homicide Unit at (619) 531-2293 or Crime Stoppers at (888) 580-8477.\\nDaniel Robinson was last seen 50 miles southwest of Phoenix on June 23. He is a geologist and was testing groundwater at a well site in a remote part of the desert when he went missing. Since then, his father, David Robinson, has been desperately searching for answers to find his 24-year-old son. \"I only imagine every time I look out there, my son\\'s somewhere hoping that his dad will come find him, you know?\" said David Robinson. Despite the local Buckeye Police Department launching an extensive aerial and 70-square-mile ground search, the Robinson family say they feel let down by what they say is a lack of urgency and motivation by authorities in finding Daniel. \"I feel that there\\'s a lot of answers that wasn\\'t answered for me regarding my son\\'s case. I\\'m still searching for those answers and I\\'m going to keep trying until I get them,\" said Robinson. At the end of 2020, the FBI had recovered over 89,000 active missing persons cases and approximately 45% of those were people of color, according to the FBI\\'s National Crime Information Center. \"Often, and very often, people of color have to go through hurdles and do not receive the urgency that it takes to find their loved ones,\" David Robinson said during a press conference. Derrica Wilson is the co-founder of the Black and Missing Foundation, an organization aimed at drawing national attention to missing person reports of color. \"Oftentimes when Black and brown children go missing, they\\'re labeled as runaways. Runaways are not receiving the Amber Alert,\" said Wilson. \"When it\\'s an adult that\\'s missing -- male or female, Black or brown -- their disappearance is oftentimes associated with some sort of criminal activity... It really desensitizes the case and it dehumanizes them.\" With no new leads in their son\\'s case, on Sept. 26 the Robinson family held their own press conference outside the Buckeye Police Department, along with local community leaders to draw national attention to their son\\'s case. Melissa Edmonds, Daniel Robinson\\'s mother, said that her son and his siblings dreamed of making an impact. \"With all the global warming and the changes in the climate, he just wanted to be a part of something great,\" Edmonda said and that her son would joke with her about someday being in National Geographic magazine. Edmonds said that her daughter, Davisha Davidson, was the one who told her that Daniel was missing. According to the police report, one of Daniel Davidson\\'s coworkers said he last saw him leaving the job site and driving off the road into the desert. Davidson was driving a 2017 blue Jeep Renegade around 9:15 a.m. David Robinson said he filed a missing persons report later that night. \"I contacted the Buckeye Police Department, informing them, our son, geologist Daniel Robinson, has been missing for over 12 hours,\" said David Robinson. \"I did ask them to go search in the desert for my son and being that it was night I was told by an officer that they would try to do it in the morning.\" According to the police report, a responding officer called Daniel Robinson\\'s phone multiple times and then went out to search the area where he was last seen, but did not find him or his vehicle. Concerned by the lack of answers from authorities, David Robinson drove more than 2,000 miles from his home in Columbia, South Carolina, to Arizona so he could search for his son. \"I made a quick decision, throw everything I had in my vehicle, and started heading up to Phoenix to go take care of my son,\" said Robinson. \"My son was my mission.\" On July 6, almost two weeks after Daniel Robinson went missing, the police department searched his home and found no indication that he had packed and planned for a trip of any kind, according to the police report. Meanwhile, Robinson gathered a group of hundreds of local volunteers to lead a search party in the desert. Robinson said the group is organized to comb the desert a section at a time. \"We set up a tent on this little area over here for water, medical aid, things like that,\" said Robinson, who added that there was a command center. \"We send teams. Each team is responsible for their own grid.\" Nearly one month after Daniel Robinson\\'s disappearance, a break in the case came when a local rancher found his jeep in a remote part of the desert in a 20-foot ravine, about 4 miles southwest from his work site. According to authorities, the vehicle was found rolled over on its side and the airbags were deployed, but Daniel Robinson\\'s body was not found. His wallet, phone and keys were found inside the car and a pile of his clothes were found nearby, said officials. David Robinson said the Buckeye Police had told him they believe that his son was in a car accident and may have sustained a head injury. The police said they had ruled out foul play. On Sept. 23, the Buckeye Police Department released a report that outlined Daniel Robinson\\'s mental state in the days leading to his disappearance and said reportedly, \"Daniel was acting off at the job site.\" Separately, he was also reportedly acting strange with a young woman he met, while working on the side for a food delivery service. \"[The detective] said that he believed our son was delusional after the head injury. And he walked away and may have rested somewhere,\" said Robinson, who wasn\\'t satisfied with that conclusion. \"I decided to bring on a private investigator because I wasn\\'t getting answers that I need.\" Robinson hired Jeff McGrath, who said he downloaded the Jeep\\'s so-called black box and allegedly found things that concerned him. \"So [Daniel] went missing anywhere from 9:15 to 9:45 in the morning, and the Uconnect tells us that the airbags blew at about 1:00 p.m. So there\\'s a time gap there,\" said McGrath. \"I don\\'t know if somebody is joyriding in this car; found it and decided they wanted to crash it. If somebody was trying to make it look like somebody was injured or died in this vehicle. I just don\\'t know what happened,\" McGrath added. McGrath said he reached out to the Buckeye Police Department to share his findings, but said he\\'s been met with difficulty. \"I have relayed all my information to them. I don\\'t think they want to hear what I have to say,\" said McGrath. Authorities have maintained an \"open line of communication\" with the Robinson family and their private investigator, the Buckeye Police Department told ABC News. They said they are utilizing every resource possible to locate Daniel Robinson including assistance from partner agencies and information provided by the public. They also said they have conducted four ground searches and three aerial searches. For now, Daniel Robinson\\'s family says they are hoping to find their son and to help draw attention to other families with missing loved ones. \"I plan to stay in Arizona until my son is found. I\\'m here for my family, staying on the front line, for them,\" said David Robinson. \"We have to have somebody here until he\\'s found.\"\\nThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack issued 11 subpoenas Wednesday to organizers of the pro-Trump rally outside the White House that turned into a march on the U.S Capitol. The committee, which recently subpoenaed Trump\\'s closest aides and advisers for records and depositions by mid-October, is seeking documents and testimony as part of its investigation into the insurrection at the Capitol and Trump\\'s actions before, during and after the riot, along with Trump\\'s broader campaign to challenge the election results from inside and outside the federal government. Trump himself addressed the rally, which was held just south of the White House on the National Mall. As part of their inquiry, investigators are reviewing ties and communications between Trump White House associates and organizers of the \"Stop the Steal\" rally, which was planned for the day Congress convened to affirm the election results. Thousands of people traveled to D.C. for the event, with many going on to assault police officers and forcibly enter the U.S. Capitol, temporarily disrupting the electoral count. Conservative activist Amy Kremer, who founded \"Women for America First,\" the group that put together the rally supporting Trump on the day of the electoral vote count, was singled out by the panel in their second tranche of subpoenas, along with her daughter, Kylie. Caroline Wren and Maggie Mulvaney, who were listed on the event permits with the National Park Service, were also subpoenaed, the committee said. Mulvaney is the niece of former Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and worked on Trump\\'s presidential campaign. \"The Select Committee is investigating the facts, circumstances, and causes of the January 6th attack and issues relating to the peaceful transfer of power, in order to identify and evaluate lessons learned and to recommend to the House and its relevant committees corrective laws, policies, procedures rules, or regulations,\" Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson wrote in the letter to each subpoena recipient. \"The inquiry includes examination of how various individuals and entities coordinated their activities leading up to the events of January 6, 2021.\" The panel also subpoenaed Hannah Salem, a GOP operative who was listed on the paperwork and previously served as a senior Trump White House press aide. Katrina Pierson, a former Trump campaign adviser and Tea Party activist who served as a campaign spokesperson in 2016 and spoke at the Jan. 6 rally was also subpoenaed by the committee. \"Americans will stand up for themselves and protect their rights, and they will demand that the politicians that we elect will uphold those rights, or we will go after them,\" Pierson said at the rally. The others subpoenaed were Cynthia Chafian, who submitted the first permit application for the event, and Justin Caporale, Tim Unes, Megan Powers and Lyndon Brentnall, all of whom were listed on permit paperwork. The committee said Wednesday it had notified the recipients of the subpoenas within the past 24 hours. Thompson told reporters last week that the committee could also issue subpoenas to former President Trump\\'s children as part of its investigation. Trump\\'s two eldest sons, Donald Jr., and Eric, spoke at the rally, as did his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, and Don Jr.\\'s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host and Trump campaign adviser.\\nAs the vaccination deadline for Los Angeles public school staff approaches, nearly 20% of employees have not yet complied, according to the district. Employees have until Oct. 15 to receive either the second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine or the one-dose Johnson & Johnson shot, a Los Angeles Unified School District spokesperson said in a statement. Over 80% of staff are currently vaccinated, not including those who are scheduled to get their second or single dose by the deadline or who have not yet uploaded their vaccine records, according to the spokesperson. \"Employee vaccination rates continue to climb and we are seeing significant increases day over day and week over week,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are confident that we will see the numbers continue to go up as we approach the deadline.\" The district has been holding daily vaccine clinics and information sessions to help staff upload their vaccination records. Staff who don\\'t comply with the mandate could be placed on unpaid leave or removed from their positions. The district allows for exemptions due to disability or religious belief, though it\\'s unclear how many exemptions have been issued. The district employs around 73,000 people. The vaccination deadline looms as the district is facing staffing shortages, including some 622 teaching position vacancies, according to a superintendent\\'s report presented to the school board Tuesday. One union, which represents nearly 30,000 food service workers, custodians, special education assistants, bus drivers and other workers in Los Angeles public schools, has called on the district to extend the vaccine deadline to the end of October. \"Even though we are working diligently to communicate about the importance of getting vaccinated, we believe the October 15, 2021, deadline does not give enough time for thousands of workers to receive the vaccine,\" Max Arias, executive director of SEIU Local 99, said in a statement. \"We are urging the district to move the deadline for school workers to be fully vaccinated to October 31, 2021, to give employees the time to complete the vaccination process.\" About 70% of the union\\'s members are vaccinated, Arias said. \"We are committed to the health and wellbeing of all students as exemplified by the thousands of SEIU Local 99 members that, at great risk, worked in person during the pandemic to maintain schools and ensure students had access to meals, testing and vaccination,\" he said. \"But we need to ensure that there is a fair and balanced approach to how we achieve our goal of 100% vaccination at schools.\" The district, the second-largest in the nation, has implemented some of the most rigorous COVID-19 mitigation measures to keep school doors open safely, including weekly testing of students and staff. Students ages 12 and up are also required to be fully vaccinated by Jan. 10, barring medical exemptions. Those participating in extracurricular programs will need to get their first dose before Oct. 3.\\nThe stopgap funding bill made it to his desk just hours before the deadline.

The boy allegedly responsible for shooting a fellow student at a Memphis school Thursday morning will be charged with attempted murder, police said. Memphis police initially were searching for a male juvenile suspect and later said the boy turned himself in. The 13-year-old suspect is in custody and is expected to be charged with criminal attempt first-degree murder Thursday night, Memphis Police Department Deputy Chief Don Crowe said at an evening press briefing. The student will be transferred to juvenile court, police said. The victim, also 13, is hospitalized at Le Bonheur Children\\'s Hospital in critical but stable condition, police and hospital officials said. He is expected to make a full recovery, school officials said. No other injuries were reported. Shelby County Schools said the incident occurred at around 9 a.m. local time at Cummings K-8, a kindergarten through eighth grade school. The shooting took place in a stairwell, and surveillance video reviewed by authorities showed that no other students were in the area at the time, Crowe said. No additional details, such as a possible motive or how the suspect obtained the gun, were shared by officials. Nearly 100 officers were deployed to the school after the shooting and helped clear the building, police said. The school was then put on lockdown and parents were notified, the district said. There is no additional threat and the school will be open Friday, Shelby County Schools Superintendent Joris Ray said during the press briefing. The school will offer mental health and counseling resources to students and staff and have heightened security, he said. \"Our schools should be a place to run to, and not run from,\" Ray said, urging parents to check their children\\'s backpacks. \"Gun violence has no place in our schools or communities.\" ABC News\\' Will McDuffie and Will Gretsky contributed to this report.\\nThe number of military suicides jumped by 15% in 2020, fueled by significant increases in the Army and Marine Corps that senior leaders said were troubling and require more effort to prevent WASHINGTON -- The number of U.S. military suicides jumped by 15% last year, fueled by significant increases in the Army and Marine Corps that senior leaders called troubling. They urged more effort to reverse the trend. According to data released Thursday, there were 580 suicides last year compared with 504 the prior year. Of those, the number of suicides by Army National Guard troops jumped by about 35%, from 76 in 2019 to 103 last year, and the active duty Army saw a nearly 20% rise. Marine Corps suicides went up by more than 30%, from 47 to 62; while the Marine Corps Reserves went from nine deaths to 10. \"The findings are troubling,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. \"Suicide rates among our service members and military families are still too high, and the trends are not going in the right direction.\" Suicide has long been a problem in the U.S. military. While the causes of suicide are complex and not fully understood, military leaders have previously said they believed the COVID-19 pandemic was adding stress to an already strained force. Troops last year were called to help provide testing and later vaccines while struggling with the virus themselves and among relatives and friends. They also dealt with continued war-zone deployments, national disasters and often violent civil unrest. Behavioral research has linked military suicides to a range of personal issues, including financial and marital stress. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby acknowledged the Defense Department cannot fully explain the increases in suicides in recent years. \"One of the things that is bedeviling about suicide is that it\\'s often very hard to connect dots in causality -- what leads somebody to make that decision,\" Kirby said. \"It\\'s difficult to denote specific causality with suicide on an individual basis, let alone on an institutional basis. And I think that\\'s why it\\'s so difficult for us to speak to it with any specificity, except to say we take this very, very seriously.\" Military leaders for a number of years have sought to reduce the stigma associated with seeking mental health assistance. That message was conveyed in a remarkable public statement last year by Gen. John Hyten, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He said he sought help while heading U.S. Strategic Command from 2016 to 2019. He didnt reveal details but said he saw a psychiatrist - a rare public admission by a senior officer. Army leaders on Thursday called suicide a significant challenge for the service, noting that the trend has been increasing for the last five years. \"While there is no clear understanding of what is causing the increase in suicides, we realize we have to do better in preventing suicide and ensure resources are available and readily accessible,\" said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth and Gen. James C. McConville, Army chief of staff, in a statement. The total number of Navy suicides dipped from 81 to 79, and the Air Force stayed the same, at 109. Defense officials told Pentagon reporters Thursday that the rate of suicides per 100,000 service members did not increase by a \"statistically significant\" amount, saying it was within the margin of error. Department data showed that the rates increased across the board for the active duty, Guard and Reserves, by between two and seven suicides per 100,000. Army Maj. Gen. Clement Coward, acting executive director for the Force Resiliency office, said the department did not see a \"statistical change in suicide rates\" to indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact. But, he added, that they are still looking at the issue. \"We have always known that COVID, and the measures to respond to it, have presented unique challenges that would include risk factors for some folks,\" he said. He and Karin Orvis, director of the department\\'s suicide prevention office, acknowledged that the overall trend indicates the department must do more to reduce the stigma of seeking help. \"Preventing suicide across our total forces is top priority,\" said Orvis. \"These trends do not rest well with me, or the department. I fully realize we have more work to do.\" According to the Pentagon, enlisted male service members under the age of 30 were most at risk for suicide. While they make up less than 42% of the total force, men under 30 accounted for about 63% of the suicide deaths. By far, the most common method of suicide was a gun, followed by hanging or asphyxiation. Coward said the military suicide rates were comparable to civilian U.S. rates. The use of a firearm was more frequent within the military than the civilian population.\\nThe need for water in the West will continue unless emissions are curbed. The thirst for water in the Western U.S. will likely not be quenched in the near future. Drought conditions are expected to persist in the West, which is already amid a decades-long megadrought, through 2022 and beyond, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\\'s drought outlook. The drought will remain the worst from California to the Northern Plains, according to the report. Precipitation totals in the Southwest over the 20 months from January 2020 and August 2021 are the lowest on record since at least 1895, according to the report. The 2021 to 2022 winter season is forecast to be drier than average. The megadrought that\\'s plaguing much of the West is a direct consequence of climate change, experts have told ABC News. The new NOAA report did not outright blame warming temperatures across the globe for the regional drought, but stated the drought is occurring due to \"successive seasons of below average precipitation that appear to have come from natural, but unfavorable, variables in the atmosphere.\" NOAA scientists did concede that continued greenhouse gas emissions will exacerbate drought conditions in the Southwest and that \"increasing atmospheric demand for water\" will only end if human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. \"Continued warming of the U.S Southwest due to greenhouse gas emissions will make even randomly occurring seasons of average- to below-average precipitation a potential drought trigger and intensify droughts beyond what would be expected from rainfall or snowpack deficits alone,\" the report stated. La Nina is expected to develop in the coming months will bring some relief to the drought in the Pacific Northwest, NOAA\\'s Climate Prediction Center has announced. While the impacts from La Nina can vary and be hard to predict, it typically brings drier than average conditions across the southern U.S., including parts of the Southwest, and above average rain conditions in the Pacific Northwest, especially along the coast, which could help to alleviate drought conditions there. ABC News\\' Julia Jacobo contributed to this report.\\nCongress has until the end of the day Thursday to pass a temporary funding bill. A possible government shutdown is looming as funding runs out at the end of the day Thursday, and Congress has yet to pass a temporary measure to keep the government going. If one passes both the Senate and House it could be on President Joe Bidens desk for his signature by Thursday. But if Congress fails to act, a government shutdown could begin as early as Friday. If theres a government shutdown, does everything close? No, not everything. A full government shutdown would mean federal agencies close their doors or reduce their operations to only what is deemed essential. Programs and agencies that receive mandatory funding or are self-sufficient, such as the U.S. Postal Service, will continue to operate. Only those programs and agencies that are dependent on annual appropriations will be running with empty pockets. Essential services necessary for public safety such as air traffic control and law enforcement will keep operating -- though not necessarily at the same levels. If essential services continue, why should I care? During a shutdown, agencies are stripped to the bone, providing only what is necessary to protect life and property or what is required by law. Agency services most directly connected to the public are likely to cease or be severely delayed, seeing \"tremendous disruption and uncertainty\" as they adjust to reduced staff and operations, according to David Reich of the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. National parks and Smithsonian museums will close, and while people will still receive their Social Security payments, benefit verification, processing overpayments and issuing replacement Medicare cards will stop. There could be delays in air travel with reductions in the Transportation Security Administrations workforce. If you have any questions about your taxes, there wont be anyone on the other end of the line at the Internal Revenue Service because it will not be continuing its customer service. Will the CDC and FDA close - even though we\\'re in a pandemic? No, but there might be delays. Among those agencies that typically see a reduction in operations are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. While these agencies are integral to coronavirus vaccine distribution and combating the coronavirus, they will be continuing their pandemic-related functions at a much-reduced capacity. The Department of Health and Human Services, the umbrella agency over the CDC, FDA and NIH, will be furloughing 43% of its employees, according to its shutdown contingency plan. Agencies are responsible for creating their own plans for how they will continue operating if money runs out. Do we know for sure what services will stop? Yes, and no. Last week, the White House budget office, the Office of Budget and Management, reminded senior agency officials to review and update their shutdown plans. Some agencies have released their plans outlining what is expected to continue and what will be put on hold. But according to Maya MacGuineas, the president of the nonpartisan think tank Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, its never clear until a shutdown which services will pass the absolutely necessary test. \"But one thing is for sure, a lot of people will go home and won\\'t be doing their jobs and that slows down the process of just about everything,\" she said. How many workers will be affected? There are about 2.1 million civilian federal employees, according to the Congressional Research Service. During a shutdown, federal employees are either sent home or asked to work without pay. For example, the Department of Defense is planning to reduce its civilian workforce by 55%, and the Environmental Protection Agency will be furloughing 99% of its employees. For a small fraction of federal employees, their salaries are financed through funding other than appropriations. Yet for the majority of the federal workforce, the essential employees left staffing agencies would be missing out on their paychecks. Jacqueline Simon, public policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing over 700,000 government workers, said that for many federal employees, the lack of a paycheck creates tremendous hardship. \"They have rent to pay. They have mortgages to pay, insurance payments, car payments, child support,\" she said. \"There is a myth that federal employees are all well paid professionals and thats just not true.\" About a third of the employees the union represents fall into the category of people who make less than $40,000 a year and may not have the financial cushion to keep working without pay, Simon said. Federal employees working through the shutdown get back pay, but that will not help them in the interim. Will a shutdown affect the economy? A government shutdown does not usually have widespread impacts on the economy unless they drone on for weeks. The 2018-2019 partial shutdown under the Trump administration resulted in economic losses of $1.2 billion each week; it was the longest in the nations history, lasting 35 days. The longer a shutdown lasts, the more areas with high numbers of federal employees could see their local economies begin to suffer because those employees are not getting paid, according to Richard Kogan of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Government shutdowns create distrust with how the government functions and the uncertainty can impact the economy, MacGuineas said. Compounding the uncertainty is whether Congress is going to pass a raise or suspension to the debt ceiling so the U.S. does not default on its obligations, which is a separate and much more serious issue from the shutdown.

Derek Jancart, who was among members of the pro-Trump mob that entered the Capitol and made it as far as Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s conference room, had pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. He was not accused of participating in any violence during the riot. The Justice Department had asked that he be sentenced to four months in jail, more than they have requested for other lower-level misdemeanor defendants. Prosecutors noted Jancart\\'s former service in the military, saying he \"swore an oath to defend the country, and instead participated on an attack against democracy itself.\" Jancart and his attorney countered by asking Judge James Boasberg to instead sentence him to probation. At Wednesday\\'s hearing, Jancart apologized to the court for his actions at the Capitol, saying he \"didn\\'t go there to hurt anybody.\" \"I did get caught up in the moment ... I wish in hindsight I had stayed back,\" Jancart told the court.\" I love this country and I feel ashamed of my actions.\" The George Washington University Project on Extremism says that 71 of the more than 600 people charged so far in connection with the Capitol attack have claimed to have military experience. Jancart is the first Jan. 6 defendant with military service to be sentenced for joining in the insurrection. A co-defendant of Jancart\\'s, Erik Rau, was also sentenced Wednesday to 45 days in jail. Rau cried as he addressed the court, saying that his involvement in the Jan. 6 attack had taken a toll on his family. \"I am first of all very sorry that you are having to spend your morning having to deal with me,\" Rau said. He told the court that \"there is no excuse\" for his actions during the insurrection. To date, more than 80 rioters have pleaded guilty to the charges against them, based on a tally by ABC News. Of the seven other defendants sentenced after pleading guilty to misdemeanor offenses, none have been ordered to spend time in jail, with the exception of two sentenced to time served after they received pretrial detention. In recent hearings, several judges have expressed concern that the Justice Department is not seeking harsh enough punishments for some of those charged in connection with the attack.\\nThe NBA regular season is set to tip off on Oct. 19. The NBA is warning players unvaccinated for COVID-19 that they will not be paid for games they miss due to local executive orders governing requirements for shots. \"Any player who elects not to comply with local vaccination mandates will not be paid for games that he misses,\" Mike Bass, the NBA\\'s executive vice president of communications, said in a statement Wednesday morning. The new rule, initially reported by ESPN, could pose problems for teams like the Brooklyn Nets and Golden State Warriors because New York and San Francisco are among the cities requiring COVID-19 vaccines to enter those teams\\' basketball arenas. The Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the Nets\\' home court, requires one coronavirus shot to enter. At the same time, San Francisco\\'s Chase Center, where the Warriors play, mandates that only fully vaccinated people can enter. On Friday, the NBA announced it had \"reviewed and denied\" Warriors player Andrew Wiggins request for a religious exemption and that he would not be able to play in Warriors home games until he meets San Francisco\\'s vaccine mandate. The Warriors\\' first regular-season home game is scheduled for Oct. 21. During the Warriors\\' media day on Monday, Wiggins told reporters that his vaccination status is \"private\" but acknowledged his \"back is definitely against the wall.\" \"Im just going to keep fighting for what I believe,\" Wiggins said. \"Im going to keep fighting for what I believe is right. Whats right to one person isnt right to the other and vice versa.\" Wiggins\\' annual salary is $31.6 million. Nets star Kyrie Irving, who makes about $34 million a year, was forced to participate in the team\\'s media day at Barclays Center on Monday via Zoom as a result of the vaccine mandate in New York. However, he refused to discuss his vaccine status. \"That doesn\\'t mean that I\\'m putting any limits on the future of me being able to join the team,\" Irving, vice president of the National Basketball Players Association, said without elaborating. The Nets home opener is scheduled for Oct. 24. The vaccine mandates in San Francisco and Brooklyn only apply to players who compete in those markets, according to the NBA. Out-of-town players are exempt from executive orders. The New York Knicks previously said its entire organization, including all players, is fully vaccinated and in compliance with the New York City law. Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James publicly revealed on Tuesday that he got the vaccine. \"I think everyone has their own choice to do what they feel is right for themselves and their family and things of that nature,\" James told reporters. \"I know that I was very (skeptical) about it all. But after doing my research and things of that nature, I felt like it was best suited for not only me but for my family and my friends. And, you know, thats why I decided to do it.\" The NBA is set to tip-off its regular season on Oct. 19 and teams are expected to play a regular 82-game schedule for the first time since the 2018-2019 season.\\nMore than 100 years after the Tulsa Race Massacre, survivors and their descendants are still seeking justice in court for the atrocities committed against a once-thriving Black community. In 1921, a mob of white vigilantes eviscerated Tulsa\\'s Greenwood neighborhood, known at the time as \"Black Wall Street\" due to its affluence and successful business enterprises. The racist violence killed at least 300 people, wounded thousands and destroyed some 35 acres of commercial and residential property. \"This lawsuit seeks to get justice and repair for the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre and the 100 years of continuing harm,\" attorney Damario Solomon-Simmons, who is representing the plaintiffs, told ABC News. \"What we say in a lawsuit, and what we believe we can prove, is that the massacre created what\\'s called a public nuisance, and that nuisance has continued unabated, meaning has not been fixed, or repaired, since it was instituted.\" Three living survivors of the horror -- Lessie Benningfield Randle, Viola Fletcher and Hughes Van Ellis -- appeared in a Tulsa courtroom on Tuesday as Solomon-Simmons argued for the case, seeking acknowledgment and accountability from the city and local government. The fate of the suit is now in the hands of District Judge Caroline Wall, who is set to rule on whether it can proceed. \"They were there the whole time all through,\" Solomon-Simmons told ABC News on Wednesday of the three centenarians. \"They are lucid. They are strong. They\\'re inspirational, and we feel like they deserve this day in court, when others have died without justice. So we are so inspired and motivated to get them justice before it\\'s too late.\" Solomon-Simmons called the hearing \"historic,\" as it comes after more than a century of efforts from survivors. The attorney added that for the court to declare and acknowledge that this massacre occurred and has continued to cause harm \"can provide so much of a sense of healing.\" \"When you have survivors who experienced murder, saw looting, their community being burnt down, literally had to run for the lives and run out of town,\" he said, \"and then the same entities who created that harm refuse to accept responsibility, refuse to even acknowledge that they did what actually occurred, that continues trauma, that continues the harm to those survivors.\" \"Just getting the court to recognize, by law, these people did this worst act of domestic terrorism in the history of this nation, starts to heal it,\" he added. \"And then if these people are ordered to abate or fix the problem, to stop the nuisance, then and only then can this community and those impacted by the massacre be made whole.\" Fletcher, one of the survivors of the massacre, testified in front of a congressional committee in May, saying, \"I still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lying in the street. I still smell smoke and see fire.\" \"I still see Black businesses being burned. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams. I have lived through the massacre every day,\" Fletcher, who was 7 at the time, added. \"Our country may forget this history, but I cannot. I will not, and other survivors do not. And our descendants do not.\" A Tulsa city spokesperson declined ABC News\\' request for comment Wednesday, citing the ongoing litigation. The city has argued in court filings that, among other things, too much time has passed since the claims in the suit were made. The city commemorated the 100th anniversary of the massacre in early June. Meanwhile, work is still underway to identify the remains found in a mass grave in October 2020, which are believed to be connected to the violence.\\nIntense phone calls, ice cream and some bipartisanship -- for a few hours, anyway. The Congressional Baseball Game had it all as lawmakers of all stripes came together Wednesday night to enjoy a little of Americas favorite pastime. The traditional game was held hours before a potential government shutdown and crucial infrastructure bill vote. Though many lawmakers were at Washington\\'s Nationals Park ready to play ball, business was still booming on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced senators reached a deal to avert a government shutdown just hours before it wouldve taken effect. But it wasnt game over for Democrats just yet. On Thursday, lawmakers are set to vote on President Joe Bidens widely-touted $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. The White House has struggled to get moderates like Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Joseph Manchin, D-W.Va., on board as well as Democratic progressives who worry about social spending programs being cut from the bill as a result of those negotiations. If Thursdays vote fails, it would be a big hit to Bidens \"Build Back Better\" agenda, and it would highlight a lack of Democratic Party consensus ahead of the midterm elections. So, Wednesdays game had more implications than just the usual bragging rights, and it showed, because big players came out, and not just to cheer on their colleagues. After the first inning, the game paused. Then, Biden appeared from behind home plate. Fans sitting in the Democratic section erupted into cheers while Republican fans booed and chanted for the game to resume. Biden then sat in the Democrats dugout for some time, talking with lawmakers. On multiple occasions, lawmakers handed the president their phones to either take photos with them or jump on calls. More than once he was seen looking intense while leaning on the railing of the dugout and talking on the phone. But, it wasnt all work. Biden handed out ice cream bars to both teams, complete with the presidential seal. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and second gentleman Doug Emhoff didnt suit up to play, but cheered on Democrats. Pelosi was also busy multitasking, watching the game while talking animatedly on the phone. She appeared to spend most of the night busy with negotiations as Democratic leaders go into crunch mode trying to get their lawmakers on the same page ahead of Thursday\\'s infrastructure vote. Progressive Democrats on Tuesday warned Pelosi and other party leaders that without a deal on a broader social policy bill, they did not intend to support the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Earlier in the evening Wednesday, Biden was inducted into the Congressional Baseball Hall of Fame. His granddaughter, Naomi Biden, accepted the award on his behalf, leading many to believe the president was caught up in infrastructure negotiations. Democrats can hope those negotiations go better for Democrats than on the field. Republican lawmakers led the game for most of the night and ended up taking home the trophy, winning 13-12. The Congressional Baseball Game has been held since the early 1900s. Its a chance for members of Congress to put aside their political differences on the Hill and instead take them to the field. The game supports Washington, D.C., charities and philanthropies, which include The Washington Literacy Center, The Boys and Girls Club and the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund.\\nAs President Joe Biden faces a critical moment for his agenda, Americans\\' confidence in his handling of a range of issues is eroding, a new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds. Compared to an August ABC News/Ipsos poll, public approval of how Biden is handling key issues -- the pandemic, immigration and the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, gun violence and even rebuilding the nation\\'s infrastructure, the issue he\\'s pushing this week -- is on the decline. Dissatisfaction among Republicans and independents is fueling the decline, but the president\\'s ratings are also hampered by more lackluster approval among members of his own party than presidents typically enjoy. The poll, which was conducted Sept. 24-28 using Ipsos\\' KnowledgePanel, comes roughly a month after the most difficult stretch of his presidency thus far -- the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Thirteen U.S. service members were killed in a terrorist attack at Kabul\\'s Hamid Karzai International Airport during that drawdown, and for the first time since taking office, FiveThirtyEight\\'s tracker averaging presidential approval polls showed more Americans disapproved than approved of the job Biden was doing as president. His overall approval rating now, measured by FiveThirtyEight\\'s average at 49% disapprove and 45% approve, has worsened since late August, and that sentiment is reflected in the issue-specific approvals measured in this most recent ABC News/Ipsos poll. Biden\\'s performance on the coronavirus remains his strongest issue, with nearly six in 10 (57%) Americans still approving of how he is handling it. Still, compared to the ABC News/Ipsos poll in the field Aug. 27-28, Biden\\'s approval on this issue is down seven points overall and among independents, and down 14 points among Republicans. It\\'s also down 15 points from his late March record high on COVID-19 job performance in ABC News/Ipsos polling. Although some Americans are now eligible for a third shot of the vaccine, following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of boosters for certain populations, vaccinating the unvaccinated remains a central challenge for Biden as his administration works to end the pandemic. Children under 12 are not currently eligible for vaccines, but that\\'s likely to change soon. After submitting data on vaccine trials for 5- to 11-year-olds on Tuesday, Pfizer expects to formally request emergency use authorization from the FDA to vaccinate this population. But this poll, which was weighted to reflect the CDC\\'s adult vaccination rate, highlights how persuading vaccine-hesitant parents to have their children inoculated will be an additional obstacle for the Biden administration. A majority (56%) of parents with children under 12 say they are likely to have their child get the coronavirus vaccine when it is available for them. Still, over four in 10 (43%) say they are not likely to. Even among parents who are vaccinated with at least one shot, approximately two in 10 (21%) say they are not likely to get their child vaccinated when they are eligible. Nearly all (89%) unvaccinated parents say they are not likely to have their child get the coronavirus vaccine when eligible. About half of parents who have at most a high school degree or who attended some college, 49% and 48% respectively, say they are likely to get their child vaccinated when it\\'s available to their age group. Among parents with a bachelor\\'s degree or higher, seven in 10 say they are likely to have their child get the vaccine when possible. Parents who are Democrats are most likely to be vaccinated with at least one dose themselves (86%) compared to parents who are independents (65%) and parents who are Republicans (55%). For parents who are Democrats and independents, 78% and 61% respectively say they are likely to get their child vaccinated once eligible. However, though a majority of parents who are Republicans are vaccinated, fewer than four in 10 (38%) say they will have their child get the vaccine when it\\'s available to their age group. The economic recovery from the pandemic also continues to be a challenge for the president. About equal shares of the public approve and disapprove of his handling of the economic recovery, 51% to 48%. The percentage of Americans disapproving of Biden on the economy increased seven points since late August. Besides the pandemic, enacting a bill to rebuild the nation\\'s infrastructure is the most pressing priority for Biden this week, as it will be brought up for a vote on the House floor Thursday. By an 11-point margin, Americans approve of Biden\\'s handling of this issue, 55% to 44%, but disapproval has increased by nine points since late August. Among Republicans and independents, approval dropped 10 and nine points, respectively. Black and Hispanic Americans overwhelmingly support the president\\'s handling of the United States\\' infrastructure, with 71% and 70% respectively approving, while a majority of white Americans (54%) disapprove. In politics today, partisans usually are more unified in their support of or opposition to particular issues or people, but that is not the case for Biden on multiple issues. The vast majority of Democrats back the president on his handling of COVID-19 (91%), rebuilding U.S. infrastructure (87%) and the economic recovery (84%), but support among members of his party drops for his handling of Afghanistan (69%), gun violence (65%) and the immigration situation at the southern border (60%). Without overwhelming support from his party, Biden\\'s approval among U.S. adults overall falls below 40% on all three of those issues -- 38% on gun violence, 38% on Afghanistan and 33% on immigration and the situation at the border. The humanitarian crisis at the southern border was thrust into the spotlight over the last two weeks after a surge of migrants, mostly from Haiti, were sheltering under a bridge in Del Rio, Texas, hoping to claim asylum and remain in the United States. That migrant camp was cleared as of Friday, but more than 17,400 remained in the U.S., according to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. While the secretary said Friday that about 12,400 of those migrants will have an opportunity to have their asylum cases heard before an immigration judge and about 5,000 were still being processed, thousands did not have that chance before being flown directly back to Haiti or returning on their own to Mexico. The administration has employed a controversial policy using a public health rationale to immediately expel unauthorized migrants at the border. Most Americans (58%) believe the United States should allow migrants seeking asylum at the border to stay until their cases are heard while four in 10 believe they should be deported back to their native countries immediately, the ABC News/Ipsos poll found. By party, a majority of Democrats (83%) and independents (57%) believe migrants seeking asylum should be allowed to remain in the United States while their cases are heard, but about seven in 10 (72%) Republicans believe they should be deported immediately. Across racial groups, most Americans think these migrants should be allowed to stay until their asylum cases are heard, but white Americans (52%) are less likely to feel this way than Hispanic (66%) and Black (78%) Americans. METHODOLOGY - This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs\\' KnowledgePanel(r) September 24-28, 2021, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,101 adults, including an oversample of 537 parents with children under the age of 12. The overall results have a margin of sampling error of 3.7 points, including the design effect. Results among parents have a margin of sampling error of 4.7 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 31-24-36 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents. See the polls topline results and details on the methodology here. ABC News\\' Ken Goldstein and Dan Merkle contributed to this report.\\nThis report is a part of \"America Strong,\" an ABC News series highlighting stories of strength and resiliency across the nation. Tired, anxious and awaiting a new place to call home, almost 30,000 migrants were found camping or attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border in Del Rio, Texas, the Department of Homeland Security reported. The migrants, many of whom are Haitian, have trekked north through Latin America, through dangerous conditions to escape earthquakes, the worsening effects of climate change, and political unrest. Many were left without basic necessities, so the Texan activist group Black Freedom Factory answered their calls for help. The group put out calls for money, donations and other resources to help ease the burden for migrants seeking asylum. They collected, delivered and distributed tens of thousands of supplies to migrants in the United States and Mexico. \"We collected over 62,000 units in less than 48 hours last week,\" Kimiya Factory, executive director of Black Freedom Factory, said. \"People started to donate items from all over the country because the biggest question was, \\'how can we help if we\\'re not in Texas and we\\'re not near the border?\\' So we wanted to bridge that gap for people in the U.S. who care about immigrants and know what they contribute to our country.\" According to DHS, about 17,400 migrants are awaiting their turn to claim asylum in the U.S. Another 2,000 people were loaded onto planes and deported back to Haiti. And 8,000 more returned south to Mexico. Factory said the initial ask for donations quickly grew from a statewide initiative to a nationwide movement, as people across the country banded together to get these families what they need. They made an online shopping wishlist and within days, she said that her team was receiving hundreds of boxes a day. \"We\\'re bringing everything from clothes to baby supplies, hygiene products, menstruation items, food, snacks, nonperishable items -- anything you can think of has been donated,\" Factory said. The group is following the trail of where Haitians have been deported to or where they\\'ve been sent in the U.S. to help them get settled into their new lives. Interacting with the migrants has been tough for Factory and her volunteers. They say the migrants are exhausted, and the children are scared about what is next for them -- will they return to a country they don\\'t remember? But Factory said that the donations, the services and the kind gifts from donors makes the faces of migrants light up with joy and relief. \"Haitians are arriving with no clothes, no shower, so it\\'s really nice to see where [donors\\'] resources are going,\" Factory said. \"Their money and their donations are going to the right place.\" Viral photos of Haitian migrants being chased, grabbed and thrown around by Border Patrol agents in the   Rio Grande highlighted the unrest at the border, and the Biden administration and the DHS faced backlash for its treatment of the migrants. Border Patrol has temporarily stopped using agents on horseback against migrants. The agents involved in the incidents have been placed on administrative leave pending the results of a DHS investigation. \"It was horrible to see what you saw -- to see people treated like they did -- horses nearly running over people, being strapped,\" President Joe Biden said in response to a question from ABC News Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott about taking responsibility for the Border Patrol\\'s actions. \"It\\'s outrageous, I promise you, those people will pay. There is an investigation underway now, and there will be consequences. There will be consequences. It\\'s an embarrassment, beyond an embarrassment. It\\'s dangerous. It\\'s wrong, it sends the wrong message around the world, sends the wrong message at home.\" Biden was also criticized for deporting thousands of people without offering them the right to request asylum in the U.S. However, Biden defended this action by invoking Title 42, a part of U.S. public health code that \"allows the government to prevent the introduction of individuals during certain public health emergencies,\" like the coronavirus pandemic. But Factory says that she and her dedicated team of volunteers did what they felt was necessary to do, when they saw Black lives being threatened at the border. Black Freedom Factory began as a tool for Factory and other activists in the San Antonio area to address the issues of racial inequality hands on in their very own community. From gerrymandering, to gentrification, to economic inequality -- the Black Freedom Factory collaborates with other local leaders, including public officials and other grassroots movements helping change the culture. \"This further proves the anti-Blackness that is rampant in the United States, and that the pictures that we saw [of] Black migrants being whipped is indicative of the conversation about Black lives mattering,\" Factory said. \"Not just on U.S. soil but internationally, and as a Black community, we will not stand for the triggering and grotesque images that we constantly have to encounter with our people being harmed.\" Now, the Black Freedom Factory, along with the organizations they parttner with throughout the nation, say they hope that donors and volunteers continue this energy -- as the crisis at the border and the inequality faced by migrants and aslyum seekers continues. \"I hope people do not lose the sense of urgency that they felt when this news broke,\" Factory said. \"I hope that you know we continue to redistribute our wealth and our privileges as American citizens. And I hope that we understand that immigration issues and crises are everybody\\'s issue and crises, and it\\'s our duty to make sure that the democracy functions upon those values.\" \"This makes you more aware of the privilege that we have as Americans,\" she added.\\nTwo friends from Ohio have been sentenced to 45 days in jail for storming the U.S. Capitol together in January COLLEGE PARK, Md. -- Federal prosecutors assert that everybody who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 should be evaluated individually when deciding whether a prison sentence is warranted. On Wednesday, a judge accepted the Justice Department\\'s assessment that two friends from Ohio fall into a category of rioters who deserve to be incarcerated. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg sentenced Derek Jancart and Erik Rau to 45 days in jail. Prosecutors had recommended four months of imprisonment for both men. They must report to jail by Nov. 29. The jail sentences for Jancart and Rau could become benchmarks for how the courts resolve many other Capitol insurrection prosecutions, a caseload that tops 600 defendants and grows by the week. Like most of the insurrectionists who have pleaded guilty so far, Jancart and Rau aren\\'t accused of engaging in any violence or destruction at the Capitol or of conspiring to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Bidens electoral victory. Defense attorneys compared their actions to those of other Capitol riot defendants who avoided prison sentences after pleading guilty to non-violent misdemeanors. But prosecutors cited several factors in arguing that prison, not probation, was the appropriate sentence for both men -- and will be in many other cases. They said Jancart, an Air Force veteran, prepared for violence on Jan. 6 by bringing a gas mask and two-way radios to Washington. Rau, a steel mill worker, brought a medical kit and Kevlar-lined gloves. They said Jancart and Rau spent 40 minutes inside the Capitol, reaching House Speaker Nancy Pelosis conference room. Jancart celebrated the violence on social media and didn\\'t show any remorse when the FBI arrested him, according to prosecutors. They said Rau screamed, \"We have you surrounded!\" at police officers and shouted, \"Go, go, go!\" and \"Yeah, they just pushed through the guards!\" Those statements are \"akin to inciting a riot and contributed to the environment of terror on that day,\" prosecutors said. \"This was not a protest,\" prosecutors wrote. \"And it is important to convey to future rioters and would-be mob participants -- especially those who intend to improperly influence the democratic process -- that their actions will have consequences.\" The judge told Jancart and Rau that they and other rioters tried to undermine the peaceful transfer of power after a democratic election. \"There are few actions that are as serious as the one this group took on that day,\" Boasberg said. Jancart and Rau apologized and expressed remorse for their actions. \"I did get caught up in the moment,\" Jancart said. \"I just kind of followed the crowd and let my curiosity get the best of me.\" \"There is no excuse for my actions on Jan. 6,\" Rau said. \"I 100% know better than to do what I did that day.\" Jancart was arrested at his Ohio home in February. Rau was arrested in July. Both men pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum sentence of six months\\' imprisonment. Over 80 defendants have pleaded guilty to riot-related offenses, but only seven others besides Jancart and Rau have been sentenced so far. A Florida man who entered the U.S. Senate chamber was sentenced to eight months in prison. Two were sentenced to time served after six months in jail. Two were sentenced to house arrest. Two others received probation. Probationary sentences \"should not necessarily become the default,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Those who trespassed, but engaged in aggravating factors, merit serious consideration of institutional incarceration. While those who trespassed, but engaged in less serious aggravating factors, deserve a sentence more in line with minor incarceration or home confinement,\" they added. Prosecutors aren\\'t recommending prison terms for two other Capitol riot defendants who are scheduled to be sentenced separately on Friday. They\\'re seeking three months of home confinement for Andrew Ryan Bennett and two months of home confinement for Danielle Doyle, plus three years of probation for both of them. Bennett espoused conspiracy theories about the election, used \"pugnacious rhetoric\" in posting about his plans to be in Washington on Jan. 6, according to prosecutors. Surveillance video appears to show Doyle chanting near or yelling at a law enforcement officer after she entered the Capitol through a broken window, prosecutors said. Bennett and Doyle also pleaded guilty to misdemeanors punishable by a maximum of six months\\' imprisonment. Like Jancart and Rau, neither is accused of personally engaging in violence or property destruction. Rau\\'s attorney, Michelle Peterson, questioned the distinctions that prosecutors drew between Rau\\'s actions and those of Bennett and Doyle. \"Counsel points to these examples not to criticize the government -- it is not an easy task to compare cases and draw appropriate distinctions -- but rather to note that there is no perfect answer,\" she wrote. More than 50 other rioters are scheduled to be sentenced before the end of 2021.\\nMOSCOW -- Russia\\'s state censor has threatened to block YouTube in the country in retaliation for the Google-owned video platform deleting two German-language channels belonging to the Kremlin-funded broadcaster RT for allegedly publishing misinformation around COVID-19. The Russian censor, Roskomnadzor, sent a letter to Google warning that if it did not swiftly restore the two RT YouTube channels, then it faced a complete or partial block, according to Russian state news agencies that published parts of the letter Wednesday. YouTube this week deleted the two RT channels, RT DE and Der Fehlende Part, for posting what it said was misinformation on the coronavirus pandemic. YouTube in a statement said RT DE had initially received a week-long suspension, blocking it from uploading videos, because it had violated misinformation rules. But the platform said RT DE then tried to circumvent the restriction by using the other channel, Der Fehlende Part, to upload videos, a violation of YouTube\\'s user terms, which resulted in both channels being permanently banned. Russia\\'s government has responded with fury and a torrent of threats to retaliate. The Russian foreign ministry on Tuesday called the deletions an \"act of unprecedented information aggression\" and asked the state censor to take actions against YouTube and German media in Russia. RT\\'s editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, claimed the bans amounted to a \"true media war\" by Germany on Russia and said she was \"looking forward\" to Russia banning the main German public television broadcasters, ARD, ZDF and Deutsche Welle. Germany\\'s government on Wednesday said it had no involvement with YouTube\\'s decision to delete the RT channels and and criticized Russia\\'s threats to retaliate against German media. \"I want to say in crystal-clear terms that this is a decision by YouTube, and the German government, or representatives of the German government, have nothing to do with this decision,\" Steffan Seibert, the German government\\'s spokesman told reporters, according to Euronews. Seibert said anyone calling for retaliation against German media \"doesn\\'t show a good relationship with press freedom, from our point of view.\" Russian authorities have sought to pressure German state news media in Russia over the past two years amid a broader crackdown on free media. Russian officials have previously publicly threatened to withdraw the accreditation of Deutsche Welle, the foreign-focused public news agency, that has a Russian-language service. The Kremlin\\'s spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday said that in blocking the RT channels, \"there are signs\" YouTube had \"grossly\" violated Russian laws. He told reporters that if Russian law enforcement agencies concluded the same then it couldn\\'t be excluded that measures might be taken to \"oblige this platform to fulfil our laws.\" The threats to block YouTube come amid an escalating campaign by Russian authorities to pressure American tech companies, as the Kremlin seeks to take tighter control over Russia\\'s internet. Just over a week ago, Google and Apple bowed to Kremlin demands to remove some content relating to a tactical voting campaign promoted by the jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny during Russia\\'s parliamentary elections. Google removed an app as well as two videos from YouTube related to the campaign, called Smart Voting. The move was seen as the biggest concession the tech giants have made to Kremlin demands to delete content from opponents and it has alarmed liberal Russians that it is a step toward the companies accepting broader censorship in Russia. Apple and Google have largely declined to comment on the matter, except to indicate they were following local laws. Russia\\'s government has pressed Google, Facebook and Twitter for years to remove more content critical of president Vladimir Putin\\'s rule, imposing hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines on the companies. But the Kremlin had stopped short of blocking the platforms, partly because it lacked the technical capacity to do so and because it feared a backlash at home and internationally. Some experts believe that calculus has shifted though, and that the government is now prepared to take a hard line. Since earlier this year, Roskomnadzor has slowed down Twitter, causing videos and photos to load poorly. Google, in particular, has faced increased pressure in recent weeks. In the days before the company deleted the Navalny voting content, bailiffs visited its Moscow office to demand unpaid fines imposed by the censor. Google and Apple representatives were also summoned before a committee of the Russian senate, where the companies were accused of enabling \"election interference.\" The New York Times reported that Google deleted the Navalny materials after Russian authorities threatened to prosecute specific employees at its Moscow office.\\nFormer U.S. Olympic swimmer Klete Keller pleaded guilty Wednesday to a single felony charge for his participation in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Keller, a two-time gold-medalist, was seen in videos wearing a Team USA jacket in the Capitol rotunda surrounded by other members of the pro-Trump mob. He was indicted on seven federal counts in February, but in a deal reached with prosecutors he pleaded guilty to only a single count of obstructing an official proceeding, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail. Keller, however, is likely to receive a far lighter sentence after entering into a cooperation agreement with prosecutors. A separate Jan. 6 defendant who pleaded guilty to the same obstruction charge, Paul Hodgkins, was sentenced to eight months in prison in July. In charging documents, prosecutors said that while in the Capitol rotunda, Keller filmed law enforcement officers who were seeking to block the crowd from advancing through the building and at one point shook officers off him who were trying to remove him from the area. He also was captured on video yelling, \"F*** Nancy Pelosi,\" and \"F*** Chuck Schumer,\" prosecutors said. Following his participation in the riot, Keller said that that he destroyed his phone and memory card and threw away his Team USA jacket. Keller is next set to next appear before a judge in December, when prosecutors and his attorney will provide an update on the progress of his cooperation with the government. It\\'s not clear when Keller will be sentenced. More than 80 individuals have so far pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the riot at the Capitol. At least 620 have been arrested for crimes relating to the Capitol breach, according to an ABC News analysis of public court documents, and the FBI is continuing to seek tips on the identities of hundreds more.\\nSorokin, 30, was convicted in May 2019 on eight counts, including grand larceny The Anna Sorokin story is a tale of a young woman who decided to be someone else and became that person - but at an enormous cost. Dubbed names like the \"fake heiress,\" the \"Soho scammer,\" the \"Soho grifter,\" Sorokin assumed the name Anna \"Delvey\" and pretended to be a German heiress with a $67 million trust fund, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors argued Sorokin used that fake identity to swindle Manhattans elite, gaining access to exclusive parties, nightclubs and hotels until her deception came to light. She defrauded hotels, restaurants, a private jet operator and banks out of around $275,000 during a 10-month spree, prosecutors alleged. So who is the real Sorokin? \"Thats a loaded question,\" Sorokin told ABC News senior national affairs correspondent Deborah Roberts. \"I would like to show the world that Im not this dumb, greedy person that they portrayed me to be.\" Watch the full story on \"20/20\" FRIDAY at 10 p.m. ET on ABC The 30-year-old was convicted in May 2019 on eight counts, including grand larceny, attempted grand larceny and theft of services. She was sentenced to four to 12 years in prison, fined $24,000 and ordered to pay nearly $200,000 in restitution. She served just under four years and was released on good behavior in February. In reality, Sorokin, who is Russian-born but lived in Germany, comes from a middle class family. She arrived in New York City in 2013 in her 20s. Eventually Sorokin convinced people, from friends to financial institutions, that she was a wealthy socialite and a jetsetter, picking up tabs and often paying in cash -- living a glamorous and expensive life which she seemed to flaunt on Instagram and Twitter. As for the fake name \"Delvey,\" Sorokin said, \"I just came up with it.\" Sorokins plan when she moved to Manhattan was to set up a high-end members-only arts club, according to her former defense attorney Todd Spodek. \"Arts, fashion, entertainment, music, restaurants, everything in one place,\" he said. \"The name of this was the Anna Delvey Foundation, the ADF.\" But Sorokin said she never claimed to be an heiress and never claimed to come from money. She said she \"always knew\" she couldnt afford a lavish jet-setting lifestyle, and knew she couldnt pay back money she said she borrowed from others, but said she was \"trying to fix that\" before her 2017 arrest. Spodek, her defense attorney at trial argued that Sorokin did nothing wrong, that she simply exploited a system, easily seduced by glitz and glamour, and told little white lies along the way. \"Anna had every intention of doing things the right way, but she couldnt open those doors without doing something a little bit grey to open the door,\" he said. \"Everyone creates the version of themselves that they want the world to see... Everyone lies when it\\'s convenient to them... and Anna did the same thing. She couldn\\'t be 100% honest because no one would listen to her.\" \"I never had a fraudulent intent,\" Sorokin said. \"And I guess that\\'s what should really count.\" Her former friend Rachel DeLoache Williams said she was among the many people Sorokin betrayed. Williams recounted her experience in an interview with ABC News as well as in her new book, \"My Friend Anna: The True Story of a Fake Heiress.\" Williams said she met Sorokin in a Manhattan nightclub. At the time, Williams was a 28-year-old photo editor for Vanity Fair. She said her first impression of Sorokin was that she was \"slightly offbeat.\" \"People have asked [me], were there red flags?\" Williams said. \"I never questioned that she was who she said she was. I never had reason to and I wouldn\\'t have thought that way.\" Williams said that Sorokin often picked up the tab, treating her to fancy dinners, $300 private fitness sessions and infrared sauna treatments. Then, in spring 2017, Williams said Sorokin offered her an all-expenses-paid trip to Morocco. On the trip together, however, Sorokin\\'s credit cards mysteriously stopped working. \"I guess they gave me [the] impression that they pre-authorized my card or something like that,\" Sorokin said. Fearful of being stranded in a foreign country, Williams said she agreed to offer her credit cards -- her personal and company corporate card -- when asked as a temporary backup, even though she could not afford it. \"[The hotel] said to me, \\'Do you have a credit card? So I look at Anna and she\\'s like, \\'Can we just use it for now?\" Williams said. After she left Morocco and landed back in the U.S., Williams said she learned the total amount was $62,000. \"She owed me more money than I made in a year,\" she said. Sorokin told ABC News she intended to pay Williams back though she knew she didnt yet have the money. But as time went on, Williams was panicking. \"I am late with my rent,\" Williams said. \"I\\'m late with my credit card payments.\" Unrelated to the Morocco trip, Sorokin was arrested in July 2017 for theft of services when she couldnt pay her high-end Manhattan restaurant and hotel bills. Following her arraignment in court, Sorokin took off for California. Meanwhile, Williams, realizing she had been duped, went to the police and the Manhattan District Attorney\\'s Office. After Sorokin missed a court date, Williams ended up aiding investigators in a sting operation that eventually led to Sorokin\\'s second arrest in October 2017 in Malibu, California. When she was arrested, Sorokin was extradited back to New York City and taken to Rikers Island Jail, where she was held for 19 months. According to her former defense attorney, Sorokin was offered a plea deal of a three to nine-year prison sentence to resolve all criminal liability, but turned it down. \"I wanted to go to trial,\" she said. \"I felt like it was the only way to tell my story.\" Williams testified against Sorokin at her 2019 trial, and said it was the most traumatic moment of her life. \"I understand the word trauma is relative,\" Williams said. \"To have someone that I had put so much goodwill into turn out to just be like a liar and who had willfully hurt me, was very painful.\" Though Sorokin was found guilty on eight counts, she was acquitted on two, including the most serious charge against her which was attempting to steal more than $1 million from a bank. She was also acquitted of theft relating to Williams $62,000 credit card bill, which Williams said was \"extremely devastating.\" Following an investigation into the Moroccan resort charges, Williams credit card company forgave a bulk of her debt, though she was still required to pay back some of the expenses incurred. When Sorokin heard the verdict, she said she decided to \"just deal with the consequences.\" \"What, am I supposed to collapse and cry?\" she said. \"They\\'re, whatever, 50, 100 cameras in my face? So I don\\'t know. It\\'s just, like-- it\\'s really hard for me to, like, cry on demand.\" Sorokin sold the rights to her story to Netflix and Shonda Rimes, but because New York state law doesn\\'t allow criminals to profit from their crimes, the money from the deal had to first be used to pay her victims back. After her February prison release, Sorokins Instagram was back up and running, featuring photos of her drinking champagne from a claw-footed tub and seeming to be living the good life. Sorokin is now back in jail, currently in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody and could face deportation. But she is determined to stay in the U.S. So whats next for Anna Sorokin? \"I guess it remains to be seen,\" she said. \"I\\'m just trying to rewrite my story.\" ABC News\\' Catherine Thorbecke and Matt Knox contributed to this report\\nWhile the concept of the debt ceiling might seem \"in the weeds,\" it actually poses a very real threat to millions of Americans in a precarious economic period. If lawmakers on Capitol Hill remain deadlocked on raising the debt ceiling, the government could go into default -- essentially, unable to pay bills. That would directly impact the wallets of millions of Americans, including those who invest in the stock market and those who benefit from government programs such as Social Security and Medicaid. \"It would be disastrous for the American economy, for global financial markets, and for millions of families and workers whose financial security would be jeopardized by delayed payments,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned lawmakers in a hearing Tuesday. Raising the debt ceiling, she said, is \"necessary to avert a catastrophic event for our economy.\" But if you\\'ve ever wondered what exactly the debt ceiling is, you\\'re not alone. Here\\'s what it is and some of the real-world impacts it can have. What is the debt ceiling? The debt ceiling is a cap on the amount of money the U.S. government can borrow to pay its debts. Every year, Congress passes a budget that includes government spending on infrastructure, programs such as Social Security and salaries for federal workers. Congress also taxes people to pay for all that spending. But for years, the government has been spending more than it takes in from taxes and other revenue, increasing the federal deficit. The government needs to borrow money to continue paying out what Congress has already OK\\'d. The debt ceiling puts a limit on how much money the U.S. government can borrow to pay its bills. Why should I care about this? If the government cannot borrow money to continue paying for programs, there will be real-world effects for millions of Americans. Here are some of those potential effects, according to Yellen, the White House and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan organization. 15 million seniors could stop receiving Social Security payments, or see delays. 30 million families could stop receiving President Joe Biden\\'s expanded Child Tax Credit payments, or see delays. U.S. military servicemembers could stop receiving paychecks. Veterans\\' benefits could stop or be delayed. Postal workers and federal employees could stop receiving paychecks. The United States\\' credit worthiness could be downgraded, spiking interest rates, which would raise mortgage, car and credit card payments. Doubt in the typically reliable U.S. currency could tank the markets, hurting 401ks and other investments. (The S&P 500 lost 17% in the months surrounding the last debt ceiling standoff.) FEMA funding for hurricane and wildfire victims could stop. Public health funding for pandemic mitigation efforts could be cut off. Child nutrition program and other food assistance could stop. Moody\\'s Analytics has estimated that even a long impasse over the debt ceiling could cause the loss of nearly 6 million jobs, increase the unemployment rate to 9% (from 5.2% now) and cause the stock market to lose about a third of its value, wiping out $15 trillion in household wealth. Would this be worse than a government shutdown? Yes. This is an even bigger deal than a government shutdown. A government shutdown occurs when Congress does not approve a new spending bill for the next fiscal year, so new payments, such as paychecks, are stopped. In 2019, around 800,000 federal employees were impacted by a government shutdown, and markets dipped. But the United States has never defaulted on its credit. This would be uncharted territory. The suspension of basically all previously approved government programs, and the ensuing economic shocks, would be unprecedented. \"Many more parties are not paid in a default,\" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said. \"Without enough money to pay its bills, any of the payments are at risk, including all government spending, mandatory payments, interest on our debt and payments to U.S. bondholders. While a government shutdown would be disruptive, a government default could be disastrous.\" Since the debt ceiling system was instituted in 1917, Congress has never not raised the debt ceiling. Congress has voted 80 times to raise or suspend the debt limit since 1960. Why are we hitting the debt ceiling? Technically, we already hit the debt ceiling on Aug. 1. But at that time, the Treasury Department started taking so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to continue to pay the government\\'s bills. Basically, there is some accounting and investing sleight of hand going on. But one day, the department will run out of tricks and out of cash. Yellen pegged that date as Oct. 18 in a letter to lawmakers Tuesday. Right now, the federal debt is at $28.43 trillion, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation\\'s tracker. The current debt ceiling is actually $28.4 trillion -- underscoring the pressure Yellen is under to continue paying the bills through \"extraordinary measures.\" Does raising the debt ceiling allow the government to spend more? Nope. Here\\'s how Yellen put it during a Tuesday hearing on Capitol Hill: \"It has nothing to do with future programs of payments, it\\'s entirely about paying bills that have already been incurred by this Congress, in previous Congresses, and it\\'s about making good on past commitments -- as you said, paying our credit card bill.\" Democrats, who are depending on Republican help to raise the debt ceiling, are frequently reiterating the point that raising the debt ceiling does not authorize new government spending. It only allows the government to borrow money to pay for spending that previous politicians have already OK\\'d, including former President Donald Trump and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. But the standoff over the debt ceiling is coming as lawmakers, in an extremely polarized environment, debate passing one of the largest government spending packages in history, Biden\\'s $3.5 trillion Build Back Better agenda. The debate about government spending is leading to the politicization of raising the debt ceiling, and the negotiations have become completely intertwined. Republicans insist that if Democrats want to pass such a major spending bill through special budget rules that would require no Republican support, they can raise the debt ceiling on their own, too. Why do we even have a debt ceiling? One hundred years ago, Congress used to have to OK every instance of borrowing money -- a major inconvenience. So, in 1917, Congress passed a debt ceiling, which would allow the Treasury Department to borrow money for any approved spending without getting permission from Congress, up to a certain limit. The limit exists to ensure the \"power of the purse,\" or the ability to determine government spending, stays with the legislative branch, instead of shifting to the Treasury Department.\\nThe \"prime suspect\" in the case was found dead from an apparent suicide. The FBI has joined the search for 19-year-old Florida college student Miya Marcano as her desperate family said they suspect she was kidnapped from her apartment a week ago. Marcano, a student at Valencia College in Orlando, was last seen at her apartment complex on Sept. 24 and a man Orange County Sheriff John Mina named Thursday as a \"prime suspect\" in her disappearance was found dead from an apparent suicide after investigators searched his home and car. \"We\\'re just ready to bring her home, but we need everyone\\'s help. We need every resource at this point,\" Marcano\\'s aunt, Semone Westmaas, told ABC affiliate station WFTV in Orlando. Mina said at a news conference Thursday afternoon that 60 detectives from his agency\\'s Criminal Investigations Division are working exclusively on this case. \"I know that Miyas family and her loved ones are going through unimaginable anguish as they try and find out what happened to Miya,\" Mina said. \"Hundreds of sworn and civilian personnel here at the sheriffs office and beyond have been working around the clock to employ all the resources at our disposal to find Miya.\" Sheriff investigators initially named Armando Manuel Caballero, a maintenance employee at the Arden Villas apartments where Marcano lives as a person of interest in her disappearance. Authorities said Caballero had expressed a romantic interest in Marcano but she rebuffed his advances. Investigators said the 27-year-old Caballero possessed a key fob to access apartments and his was used at Marcano\\'s unit just before her disappearance. Caballero was found dead on Monday in his apartment from an apparent suicide. \"We believe that the suspect that we had named, Armando Caballero, is responsible. We dont know all the circumstances involved in what happened there, but he was obviously the prime suspect,\" Mina said. He said that at this time investigators do not believe another person was involved in the disappearance of Marcano, but have not entirely ruled out that possibility. Mina said the sheriff\\'s office Emergency Response Team and personnel from other law enforcement agencies have conducted nearly 30 searches since Marcano went missing across three different counties. He said at least 175 people have been involved in the searches. The sheriff said his agency reached out to the FBI for assistance and that the federal agency has provided resources. \"We are working with the FBI and they are assisting in this case. \"Ill just say in a manner of technology at this point,\" Mina said. He announced the FBI\\'s involvement after Marcano\\'s loved ones called on the bureau to help in the case. Mina said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has also loaned investigators a K-9 unit that is trained to search for electronics, specifically cellphones. Deputies were seen on Wednesday combing through storage facilities at the Arden Villas apartments in Orlando, where Marcano also works, and searching a nearby wooded area. Marcano was last seen at around 5 p.m. on Friday at her apartment complex, according to the Orange County Sheriff\\'s Office. Westmaas said relatives reported her missing after asking the sheriff\\'s department to conduct a welfare check on Marcano. She said that when she and other relatives entered Marcano\\'s normally tidy apartment, they found it \"a mess\" and discovered signs of an apparent struggle. WFTV obtained a video of Caballero walking through the parking lot of the Arden Villas apartments after Marcano went missing, carrying what her family said resembled items belonging to her. \"We were given that video right away,\" Mina said. \"That video led us to be able to do a search warrant on Caballero\\'s apartment and vehicle.\" Mina did not disclose what evidence investigators found.\\nDollar Tree, the national chain of stores that promises everything for a buck, will begin introducing items on its shelves that will exceed $1 CHESAPEAKE, Va. -- Dollar Tree embedded in its very name what it stands for: Behind these doors, everything can be had for just $1. The mantra to which the Chesapeake, Virginia, company has held true for decades will now be only mostly true. After expanding nationwide from only a handful of stores in Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, Dollar Tree is breaking the mold and will sell items in some locations that exceed the tantalizing $1 grab-n-go price. The cost of clothes, cars, food and just about everything else has soared this year as the global economy emerges from a pandemic uppercut and Dollar Tree has not been untouched. Last month the retail chain said that rising shipping costs would take a bite of $1.50 to $1.60 out of its per-share profits this year. Thats a huge hit for any business, perhaps more so for one founded decades ago steadfastly calling itself \"Only $1.00 Inc.\" \"For decades, our customers have enjoyed the \\'thrill-of-the-hunt for value at one dollar - and we remain committed to that core proposition - but many are telling us that they also want a broader product assortment when they come to shop,\" said CEO Michael Witynski in a prepared statement. Raising some prices will certainly give the national chain some flexibility and likely more variety on its shelves. But a dollar this year will not buy you what it did in 2020. Annual inflation in the U.S. reached 4.2% in July, the highest in three decades. And this week in an appearance before Congress, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that price increases have worsened amid snarled supply chains and rising labor costs. That has hit businesses of every type, perhaps especially one that has held the line at $1 for decades. Witynski said this week that Dollar Tree is a \"test-and-learn\" company, and they\\'ll be watching how customers react. The company had already begun testing higher prices at several hundred of its nearly 8,000 locations in a section of the store called \"Dollar Tree Plus\" with items that can go for as much as $5. Items that can go for $1.25 to $1.50 will soon be found in the mix at some locations amid the typical assortment of $1 products. Analysts with J.P. Morgan noted past conversations with Dollar Tree executives who cited a significant sales boost at stores offering a Plus section and if no one else is cheering the shift to the top side of $1 at Dollar Tree, Wall Street is. Shares of Dollar Tree Inc. jumped 13% at the opening bell Wednesday. As Dollar Tree breaks the $1 barrier, Witynski said the company would remain true to its promise of value. \"We will continue to be fiercely protective of that promise, regardless of the price point, whether it is $1.00, $1.25, $1.50,\" Witynski said.\\nMichigan lawmakers are poised to consider bipartisan bills aimed at helping potentially thousands of sex abuse victims sue for damages, including those molested by a University of Michigan sports physician LANSING, Mich. -- State lawmakers are poised to consider bipartisan bills aimed at helping potentially thousands of sex abuse victims sue for damages, including those molested by a University of Michigan sports physician. It is the second time since 2018 that the Legislature may overhaul laws in the wake of a major abuse scandal. Similar legislation was enacted following the conviction of Larry Nassar, who sexually abused hundreds of female athletes under the guise of medical treatment, including at Michigan State University. Under the new measures, victims of the late Dr. Robert Anderson at the University of Michigan and others would get additional time to bring lawsuits that might be barred by a statute of limitations. Government entities could not use the immunity defense if they knew or should have known of an accused\\'s prior sexual misconduct and failed to intervene. Similar government immunity legislation stalled three years ago -- after Michigan State agreed to a $500 million settlement for Nassar\\'s victims -- amid pushback from universities, schools, municipalities, businesses and the Catholic Church over the financial implications of facing an unknown number of suits for old allegations. Opposition could form again. \"I\\'m not trying to push the scales of justice in one way or another. I just think that these survivors deserve their day in court,\" said Rep. Ryan Berman, a Republican from Oakland Countys Commerce Township who is sponsoring the immunity bill. The House Oversight Committee on Thursday will hold the first of likely multiple hearings on the measures. Among those expected to testify are former University of Michigan wrestler Tad DeLuca, who sparked an investigation when he told the university in 2018 what Anderson did to him in the 1970s, ex-football player Jon Vaughn and at least one Nassar victim. \"They get to tell their stories. I think they\\'re so brave for doing that,\" said Rep. Karen Whitsett, a Detroit Democrat whose bill would open a one-year window for sex assault victims to sue retroactively, regardless of the time limit. Three years ago, the law was changed so Nassar victims could sue retroactively and people who were sexually abused as children could pursue legal action until their 28th birthday or three years from when they realize they have been abused. Whitsett\\'s legislation would expand the option to adults and let them file suit until whenever is later: 10 years from when the claim accrues, their 28th birthday or six years -- instead of three -- from when they realize they have been abused. \"We need to empower survivors. They need to have a platform to be heard on. They need the tools to be able to do that,\" she said. The university has acknowledged that assaults occurred. A report by a law firm hired by the school found that officials failed to stop Anderson, especially in the 1970s, despite hearing about assaults. The university is in mediation with lawyers who are seeking a settlement for at least 850 people, mostly men. Attorneys who have sued say the statute of limitations can be paused because the school \"fraudulently concealed\" the abuse for years. But the bills could provide the victims more certainty and increase pressure for a resolution. Some protested last week outside a meeting of the university\\'s governing board and called for more accountability by campus leaders. \"It will help the U of M victims. But it will also help so many men and women out there who may have been abused by a medical professional where, because of the knowledge imbalance between a doctor and patient, may not have found out or realized it for a number of years later,\" Mike Cox, a former Michigan attorney general who is representing more than 150 of the plaintiffs, said of the legislation. \"As a general matter, I think these bills are very good ideas.\" ------ Follow David Eggert at https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00\\nFederal investigators announced on Wednesday that they\\'d charged two Michigan men in a pair of unrelated schemes where each allegedly sold phony COVID-19 vaccination cards. The defendants, one of whom is a registered nurse, allegedly sold the fraudulent cards online via social media accounts and messenger services, prosecutors said. \"Regardless of whether an individual chooses to get vaccinated, we urge everyone to avoid turning to schemes like these to evade vaccination requirements. Importing these cards is a crime. Selling these cards is a crime.\" Saima Mohsin, acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said in a statement. Bethann Kierczak, 37, of Southgate, Michigan, was charged with theft of government property and theft or embezzlement related to a health care benefit program, the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office said. Kierczak, a registered nurse, allegedly stole or embezzled authentic COVID-19 vaccination record cards from a VA hospital along with vaccine lot numbers necessary to make the cards appear legitimate, prosecutors said. He allegedly sold the cards to individuals in the Detroit community for $150 to $200 each and began selling via Facebook Messenger in May. \"Since the matter of public health is so important the VA Office of Inspector General will continue to devote resources to these cases whenever and wherever they arise,\" Special Agent in Charge Gregg Hirstein of the VA Office of Inspector General said in a statement. Rapheal Jarrell Smiley, 32, of Detroit, was charged Wednesday with fraud involving department or agency seals, identity document fraud and trafficking in counterfeit goods, federal prosecutors said. Smiley allegedly ordered fraudulent COVID-19 vaccination cards from two distributors in China that have been accused of supplying the phony documents, according to the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office. Smiley allegedly advertised the cards for sale through his Facebook and Instagram accounts.\\nThe NBA has released tentative health and safety protocols to its teams to detail how players who haven\\'t gotten the COVID-19 vaccination will be tested far more often than their vaccinated colleagues and face a slew of other restrictions The NBA released tentative health and safety protocols to its teams Tuesday, detailing how players who havent gotten the COVID-19 vaccination will be tested far more often than their vaccinated colleagues and face a slew of other restrictions. Among the rules for unvaccinated players: They will not be able to eat in the same room with vaccinated teammates or staff, must have lockers as far away from vaccinated players as possible, and must stay masked and at least 6 feet away from all other attendees in any team meeting. Further, unvaccinated players will be \"required to remain at their residence when in their home market,\" teams were told in the draft of the rules, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. They will also need to stay on team hotel properties when on the road. In both cases, there are limited permissible exceptions -- such as going to buy groceries, taking children to school and the like. And unvaccinated players also will not be permitted to visit \"higher-risk settings,\" the NBA said, such as restaurants, bars, clubs, entertainment venues and large indoor gatherings. The league is working with the National Basketball Players Association to finalize the protocols, but some details were agreed upon weeks ago -- including provisions where unvaccinated players will be tested on all practice, travel, team activity and game days. Fully vaccinated players will not be subject to testing, with very limited exceptions. Fully vaccinated players -- the category that at least 90% of the league falls into -- will largely be back to business as usual. Unvaccinated players will be given coronavirus rapid tests on days where teams are practicing, traveling or having similar team events, plus they will need lab-based tests on game days. \"A vaccine mandate for NBA players would need an agreement with the Players Association,\" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said. \"The NBA has made these proposals but the players union has rejected any vaccination requirement.\" Later, the NBPA responded by celebrating the 90% vaccination rate and noting how it exceeds the national percentage. \"The real story is not why vaccination isnt mandated in the NBA. The real story for proponents of vaccination is how can we emulate the Players in the NBA,\" union executive director Michele Roberts said. LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers says he doesnt want to tell people what to do regarding vaccinations. But James -- who has more than 50 million Twitter followers and nearly 100 million on Instagram -- did reveal Tuesday that he is vaccinated. And like many other big NBA names such as Portlands Damian Lillard, Lakers teammate Anthony Davis and Milwaukees Giannis Antetokounmpo, James said he got the shots to keep his family safe. \"I think everyone has their own choice to do what they feel is right for themselves and their family and things of that nature,\" James said. \"I know that I was very (skeptical) about it all. But after doing my research and things of that nature, I felt like it was best suited for not only me but for my family and my friends. And, you know, thats why I decided to do it.\" Some top NBA players, including Washingtons Bradley Beal and Golden States Andrew Wiggins, have said they remain unvaccinated. Phoenix star Devin Booker missed the start of camp because he tested positive, revealing that over the weekend but not saying if he is vaccinated. Others, like Brooklyns Kyrie Irving -- an NBPA vice president -- have also refused to divulge their vaccination status, though Irving not attending Nets media day in person on Monday suggests he remains unvaccinated. Irving did practice with the Nets on Tuesday in San Diego, where theyre holding training camp. The status of Wiggins and Irving is particularly thorny since local ordinances in San Francisco and New York would require them to be vaccinated or get a league exception -- Wiggins has already tried that and failed -- in order to play in home games, which obviously make up half the schedule. Irving is due to make about $35 million this season, Wiggins nearly $32 million. \"Any player who elects not to comply with local vaccination mandates will not be paid for games that he misses,\" Bass said Wednesday. The difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated players will also govern the rules surrounding what happens when contact tracing flags a player as being possibly exposed to a person who is positive for COVID-19, the NBA told teams. Those who are fully vaccinated will not be required in most cases to quarantine, though will need seven days of testing. Unvaccinated players flagged by contact tracing will need to quarantine for seven days. The NBA and the players are still working on some final topics, all with hopes that this season -- unlike last year -- doesnt see waves of game postponements or players missing extended periods of time because of the virus. Remaining topics include what would trigger needs for fully vaccinated players to be tested. Some rules from last season will still apply, at least to begin this season. All players and staff, regardless of vaccination status, must wear masks in almost all situations inside team facilities, during travel and when on the bench during games. The bench rule will not apply to head coaches, who are not required to mask during games. Also, it was previously agreed that anyone in proximity to players -- stat-crew staffs, team attendants, even NBA referees -- must be vaccinated. ------ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports\\nIn a surprising development, a Russian man who was imprisoned in the U.S. for cybercrimes has been deported to Russia WASHINGTON -- In a surprising development, a Russian man who was imprisoned in the U.S. for cybercrimes has been deported to Russia, officials said Tuesday. Aleksei Burkov, 31, facilitated $20 million in credit card fraud and ran a sophisticated clearinghouse for international criminals. He was sentenced to nine years in prison last year after pleading guilty in federal court in Virginia. Burkov was flown Monday on a commercial flight back to Russia, said Dani Bennett, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She said Burkov was wanted in Russia for attempted theft and making and selling counterfeit credit cards. Burkov was arrested in Israel in 2015 at the request of the U.S. and spent several years in custody there while the Russian government fought his extradition and later filed its own extradition request. He arrived in the U.S. in 2019. His nine-year prison term included credit for time served in Israel. A New York attorney who has represented a number of high-profile Russian speakers accused of cybercrimes called Burkovs deportation while he was still in prison highly unusual and said it suggests Burkov may be involved in some sort of prisoner swap. \"After 20 years of practice I can tell you I never saw that kind of scenario\" unless the Russian government really wants that person back and is will to provide someone or something that the U.S. wants in exchange, said the attorney, Arkady Bukh. The United States and Russia do not have a treaty, as many friendly countries do, that allow prisoners to finish out their sentences in the other nation, he noted. Israeli officials suggested Russia had sought Burkovs release by offering an exchange for Naama Issachar, an Israeli woman who received a seven-year prison sentence in Moscow on marijuana charges. She was released after being pardoned by Russian President Vladimir Putin roughly a week after Burkov pleaded guilty in the U.S. Burkovs indictment in Russia drew suspicion because it occurred two years after his arrest in Israel. Analysts have likened it to a similar attempt to repatriate a different cybercriminal to Russia after his arrest abroad: cryptocurrency exchange director Alexander Vinnik. Arrested in Greece, Vinnik is currently serving a five-year sentence in France. Burkov, from St. Petersburg, Russia, operated a website called CardPlanet, which sold credit card numbers stolen through computer hacking. Prosecutors said a second website, Direct Connection, functioned as an invitation-only club where members could buy and sell stolen credit-card numbers, hacking services and malware, and criminals with different skill sets could join forces. --- Bajak reported from Boston.\\nThe City of Des Moines is confirming the longtime president of the Des Moines police officers union sent explicit photos to four female colleagues but retired before he could face disciplinary action IOWA CITY, Iowa -- The longtime president of the Des Moines police officers\\' union sent explicit photos to four female colleagues but retired before he could face discipline and wasn\\'t criminally charged, the city confirmed late Tuesday. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, four Des Moines Police Department employees alleged that they were sent unsolicited photos by Des Moines Police Bargaining Unit Association President Stew Barnes in 2019 and 2020, including many of himself naked. The department let Barnes, 61, retire in August 2020 with full benefits despite \"overwhelming evidence\" of his harassment of co-workers and employees of a tanning salon and a credit union, the lawsuit claims. Department leaders recognized him at a retirement banquet in October 2020. Iowa law allows the state pension system to deny retirement benefits to members who are not \"in good standing,\" including those who face pending disciplinary proceedings for misconduct. The lawsuit argues that Barnes should have been disqualified from benefits and faced a criminal investigation, alleging he was using police resources \"to find and stalk women\" and that his victims were ready to cooperate. \"It sends the message that you can sexually harass someone and walk away and retire if you are at the end of your career,\" said Des Moines attorney Jill Zwagerman, who is representing the women. Barnes had worked as an officer at the department since 1994 and led the nearly 300-member union since 2001. A statement issued Tuesday evening through the city managers office defended the department and the citys handling of the internal investigation but did not explain the lack of a criminal investigation. \"Consistent with state and federal law, when the City became aware of the behavior, the City immediately and thoroughly investigated the allegations and took all necessary remedial steps,\" the statement said. Barnes confirmed to have sent the inappropriate photos and resigned his job before the inquiry concluded, the statement said. Police Chief Dana Wingert later determined the misconduct occurred and that it would have been a fireable offense. \"Contrary to plaintiffs\\' complaints, the City does not have the authority to prevent the offending officer from resigning or receiving pension benefits,\" the statement said, adding that decisions on benefits fall to the Municipal Fire and Police Retirement System of Iowa. The lawsuit alleges that the departments handling of the case is part of a sexually hostile culture that needs to change. The lawsuit names the department and the city of Des Moines as defendants and alleges gender discrimination, sexual harassment and retaliation in violation of the Iowa Civil Rights Act. In addition to three officers and a digital evidence specialist who say Barnes harassed them, a fifth woman alleges she has been passed over for promotions because of her gender. The lawsuit claims that female employees are routinely subjected to sexist comments, unwanted advances and other demeaning behavior by male officers. The plaintiffs say they have been punished for filing complaints, while offending male officers get promotions or can quietly retire or resign. The plaintiffs include senior police officer Tracy Rhoads, who says she has faced sexual harassment from male employees since she was hired in 1997. She alleges Barnes approached her in 2019, saying, \"Get a load of this,\" before scrolling through his phone and showing her pictures of his penis and others in which he was naked. She and other women say that Barnes was relentless, continuing his harassment long after they told him to stop. Barnes pressured the women to participate in bets in which the loser would have to do \"naked dares\" and send photos, the lawsuit claims. Barnes sent photos of himself without clothes while riding a lawnmower and raking leaves, the suit says. The women say they were reluctant to report Barnes behavior because they feared alienating their union and had faced retaliation from the administration for prior complaints. The city\\'s statement faulted the women for failing to immediately report the misconduct \"as is required of all employees by policy.\" After Rhoads came forward in August 2020, she asked the assistant chief about the status of the inquiry days later. The lawsuit claims that he told her \"it was done\" because Barnes had quit, without looking up from the television he was watching. One department official told an employee who received nude photos from Barnes that she should be happy he was gone rather than critical of the lack of accountability, the lawsuit says. But the department\\'s problems continued. Just last month, another office resigned after making inappropriate comments to Rhoads and about another woman in front of superior officers, the lawsuit says.\\nThis is a Kaiser Health News story. Within a day of testing positive for COVID-19 in June, Miranda Kelly was sick enough to be scared. At 44, with diabetes and high blood pressure, Kelly, a certified nursing assistant, was having trouble breathing, symptoms serious enough to send her to the emergency room. When her husband, Joe, 46, fell ill with the virus, too, she really got worried, especially about their five teenagers at home: \"I thought, \\'I hope to God we dont wind up on ventilators. We have children. Whos going to raise these kids?\" But the Kellys, who live in Seattle, had agreed just after their diagnoses to join a clinical trial at the nearby Fred Hutch cancer research center thats part of an international effort to test an antiviral treatment that could halt covid early in its course. By the next day, the couple were taking four pills, twice a day. Though they werent told whether they had received an active medication or placebo, within a week, they said, their symptoms were better. Within two weeks, they had recovered. \"I dont know if we got the treatment, but I kind of feel like we did,\" Miranda Kelly said. \"To have all these underlying conditions, I felt like the recovery was very quick.\" The Kellys have a role in developing what could be the worlds next chance to thwart COVID: a short-term regimen of daily pills that can fight the virus early after diagnosis and conceivably prevent symptoms from developing after exposure. \"Oral antivirals have the potential to not only curtail the duration of ones COVID-19 syndrome, but also have the potential to limit transmission to people in your household if you are sick,\" said Timothy Sheahan, a virologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill who has helped pioneer these therapies. Antivirals are already essential treatments for other viral infections, including hepatitis C and HIV. One of the best known is Tamiflu, the widely prescribed pill that can shorten the duration of influenza and reduce the risk of hospitalization if given quickly. The medications, developed to treat and prevent viral infections in people and animals, work differently depending on the type. But they can be engineered to boost the immune system to fight infection, block receptors so viruses cant enter healthy cells, or lower the amount of active virus in the body. At least three promising antivirals for COVID are being tested in clinical trials, with results expected as soon as late fall or winter, said Carl Dieffenbach, director of the Division of AIDS at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who is overseeing antiviral development. \"I think that we will have answers as to what these pills are capable of within the next several months,\" Dieffenbach said. The top contender is a medication from Merck & Co. and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics called molnupiravir, Dieffenbach said. This is the product being tested in the Kellys Seattle trial. Two others include a candidate from Pfizer, known as PF-07321332, and AT-527, an antiviral produced by Roche and Atea Pharmaceuticals. They work by interfering with the viruss ability to replicate in human cells. In the case of molnupiravir, the enzyme that copies the viral genetic material is forced to make so many mistakes that the virus cant reproduce. That, in turn, reduces the patients viral load, shortening infection time and preventing the kind of dangerous immune response that can cause serious illness or death. So far, only one antiviral drug, remdesivir, has been approved to treat covid. But it is given intravenously to patients ill enough to be hospitalized, and is not intended for early, widespread use. By contrast, the top contenders under study can be packaged as pills. Sheahan, who also performed preclinical work on remdesivir, led an early study in mice that showed that molnupiravir could prevent early disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid. The formula was discovered at Emory University and later acquired by Ridgeback and Merck. Clinical trials have followed, including an early trial of 202 participants last spring that showed that molnupiravir rapidly reduced the levels of infectious virus. Merck chief executive Robert Davis said this month that the company expects data from its larger phase 3 trials in the coming weeks, with the potential to seek emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration \"before year-end.\" Pfizer launched a combined phase 2 and 3 trial of its product Sept. 1, and Atea officials said they expect results from phase 2 and phase 3 trials later this year. If the results are positive and emergency use is granted for any product, Dieffenbach said, \"distribution could begin quickly.\" That would mean millions of Americans soon could have access to a daily orally administered medication, ideally a single pill, that could be taken for five to 10 days at the first confirmation of COVID infection. \"When we get there, thats the idea,\" said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious diseases and immunology expert at Columbia University. \"To have this all around the country, so that people get it the same day they get diagnosed.\" Once sidelined for lack of interest, oral antivirals to treat coronavirus infections are now a subject of fierce competition and funding. In June, the Biden administration announced it had agreed to obtain about 1.7 million treatment courses of Mercks molnupiravir, at a cost of $1.2 billion, if the product receives emergency authorization or full approval. The same month, the administration said it would invest $3.2 billion in the Antiviral Program for Pandemics, which aims to develop antivirals for the COVID crisis and beyond, Dieffenbach said. The pandemic kick-started a long-neglected effort to develop potent antiviral treatments for coronaviruses, said Sheahan. Though the original SARS virus in 2003 gave scientists a scare -- followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, in 2012 -- research efforts slowed when those outbreaks did not persist. \"The commercial drive to develop any products just went down the tubes,\" said Sheahan. Widely available antiviral drugs would join the monoclonal antibody therapies already used to treat and prevent serious illness and hospitalizations caused by COVID. The lab-produced monoclonal antibodies, which mimic the bodys natural response to infection, were easier to develop but must be given primarily through intravenous infusions. The federal government is covering the cost of most monoclonal products at $2,000 a dose. Its still too early to know how the price of antivirals might compare. Like the monoclonal antibodies, antiviral pills would be no substitute for vaccination, said Griffin. They would be another tool to fight covid. \"Its nice to have another option,\" he said. One challenge in developing antiviral drugs quickly has been recruiting enough participants for the clinical trials, each of which needs to enroll many hundreds of people, said Dr. Elizabeth Duke, a Fred Hutch research associate overseeing its molnupiravir trial. Participants must be unvaccinated and enrolled in the trial within five days of a positive covid test. Any given day, interns make 100 calls to newly COVID-positive people in the Seattle area -- and most say no. \"Just generally speaking, theres a lot of mistrust about the scientific process,\" Duke said. \"And some of the people are saying kind of nasty things to the interns.\" If the antiviral pills prove effective, the next challenge will be ramping up a distribution system that can rush them to people as soon as they test positive. Griffin said it will take something akin to the program set up last year by UnitedHealthcare, which sped Tamiflu kits to 200,000 at-risk patients enrolled in the insurers Medicare Advantage plans. Merck officials predicted the company could produce more than 10 million courses of therapy by the end of the year. Atea and Pfizer have not released similar estimates. Even more promising? Studies evaluating whether antivirals can prevent infection after exposure. \"Think about that,\" said Duke, who is also overseeing a prophylactic trial. \"You could give it to everyone in a household, or everyone in a school. Then were talking about a return to, maybe, normal life.\" Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Top U.S. law enforcement officials on Thursday announced the seizure of more than 1.8 million counterfeit pills during a coordinated series of law enforcement raids throughout the country since early August. \"In recent years, we\\'ve seen an alarming increase in the number of counterfeit pills containing illicit fentanyl,\" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at a news conference. Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Anne Milgram said as part of the eight-week operation, DEA and other law enforcement partners made more than 800 arrests, seizing 158 weapons as well as 712 kilos of powdered fentanyl in addition to a myriad of other illicit drugs. The amount of fentanyl-laced pills seized by the DEA over the past eight weeks is enough to kill 700,000 people, Milgram said. \"We cannot stress enough the danger of these counterfeit pills,\" Milgram said. \"We\\'re seeing these pills being illegally sold in every state in the United States. They are cheap, they are widely available, they can be purchased online and on social media -- so through people\\'s phones, and they\\'re extremely dangerous.\" The DEA issued its first public safety alert in six years earlier this week, warning about \"unprecedented quantities\" of counterfeit pills found in every U.S. state and often containing fentanyl and meth. Agents have seized more fake pills so far this year than both of the previous two years combined, amounting to a total of 9.5 million, according to the DEA. \"They\\'re made to look nearly identical to real prescription pills,\" Milgram said. \"Their color, their size, their markings are virtually identical to what a real prescription pill would look like.\" Social media platforms including Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram have been used to market the counterfeits to teenagers, the officials said. The pills are often made to resemble real prescription opioid medication like Oxycontin, Vicodin, and Xanax, or stimulants like Adderall, according to the DEA. Most are made in Mexico with China supplying the chemicals. The DEA made clear in its announcement that legitimate prescriptions filled at a pharmacy are not impacted by this epidemic of fake pills. Only those sold on the black market. Fentanyl is the primary driver of the significant increases in drug overdose deaths in recent years. More than 93,000 people died of a drug overdose last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe school\\'s principal was wounded and later released from the hospital. Police identified the suspected gunman who stormed YES Prep Southwest Secondary school in Houston, Texas, on Friday and wounded the principal as 25-year old Dexter Harold Kelsey. Kelsey has been charged with aggravated assault against a public servant and deadly conduct in the 263rd State District Court, Houston Police announced Saturday. Houston police said a call about reports of an active shooting came in at 11:45 a.m. at 4400 Anderson Road at Hiram Clarke. Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said in a press conference Friday that officers arrived to the scene \"within minutes\" following the call and once inside the school came upon the suspect \"armed with a rifle\" and he \"surrendered without incident.\" Finner said Friday the suspect was a former student of the school. Police said Kelsey confessed to his role in the shooting and was subsequently charged. \"When he came to the building, the front door, the glass door, it was locked. He gained entry by shooting on the glass door and immediately fired upon one of the employees of the school,\" Finner said. The employee sustained a gunshot wound to the back. Police named the victim Saturday as school principal Eric Espinosa, 36, who was treated at a hospital and later released. Police said Espinosa was alerted about the shooting and attempted to warn teachers and students. \"During the gunfire, one of the bullets struck the principal in his lower back. As the principal continued to help students and teachers flee the school, responding police officers arrived, located the suspect and arrested him without further incident,\" Houston police said. YES Prep Southwest Secondary said in a statement Friday that \"no students have been injured.\" The school serves grades 6 through 12. Audio from a dispatch call reveals an official said: \"I\\'m gonna need units at 4411 Anderson Rd, just got a message that there\\'s a man with a gun in the school.\" The Houston Fire Department initially told ABC News one person was transported to Memorial Hermann Texas Medical Center Emergency Room. First responders were on the scene to actively clear the building, Houston Fire said after reports of the shooting. A seventh grader who was evacuated from the school told ABC Houston station KTRK, \"When I was coming out, I saw blood and glass shattering everywhere.\" \"My teachers told me to stay back in the classroom where nobody can see you and officers came, saying, \\'Put your hands up. Go outside,\" the student said. A staging area for parents was set up at West Fuqua and Hiram Clarke and students were sent to that location. The students had gone through active shooter training just two days earlier. Finner commended students for remaining calm during the evacuation. Finner said there are no other potential suspects and no further threat to the students.\\nPolice say they are investigating reports of a mid-air collision over Arizona. A helicopter and a fixed-wing plane collided in mid-air in Chandler, Arizona, Friday, local authorities confirmed. Chandler police tweeted that they are currently at the scene. \"We are at the scene of a mid-air collision between a plane and helicopter at a Chandler Airpark. We ask anyone who possibly witnessed or caught this incident on camera to contact Chandler PD at 480-782-4130,\" the police posted. The plane was able to land safely, but the helicopter crashed and caught on fire, the Chandler Fire department reported. Chandler Police have confirmed two deaths. This is a developing story.

The court\\'s credibility with the public also could be on the line, especially if a divided court were to overrule the landmark Roe v. Wade decision from 1973 that established a womans right to an abortion nationwide. The justices are returning to the courtroom after an 18-month absence caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and the possible retirement of 83-year-old liberal Justice Stephen Breyer also looms. It\\'s the first full term with the court in its current alignment. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the last of former President Donald Trump\\'s three high-court appointees, is part of a six-justice conservative majority. Barrett was nominated and confirmed last year amid the pandemic, little more than a month after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Trump and Republicans who controlled the Senate moved quickly to fill the seat shortly before the 2020 presidential election, bringing about a dramatic change in the court\\'s lineup that has set the stage for a potentially law-changing term on several high-profile issues. With abortion, guns and religion already on the agenda, and a challenge to affirmative action waiting in the wings, the court will answer a key question over the next year, said University of Chicago law professor David Strauss. \"Is this the term in which the culture wars return to the Supreme Court in a big way?\" Strauss said. No issue is bigger than abortion. The justices will hear arguments Dec. 1 in Mississippi\\'s bid to enforce a ban on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Lower courts blocked the law because it is inconsistent with high court rulings that allow states to regulate but not prohibit abortion before viability, the point around 24 weeks of pregnancy when a fetus can survive outside the womb. Mississippi is taking what conservative commentator Carrie Severino called a \"rip-the-Band-Aid-off\" approach to the case by asking the court to abandon its support of abortion rights that was laid out in Roe and the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Mississippi is among 12 states with so-called trigger laws that would take effect if Roe is overturned and ban abortion entirely. By a 5-4 vote in early September, the court already has allowed a ban on most abortions to take effect in Texas, though no court has yet ruled on the substance of the law. But that vote and the Mississippi case highlight the potential risk to the court\\'s reputation, said David Cole, the American Civil Liberties Union\\'s legal director. The arguments advanced by Mississippi were considered and rejected by the Supreme Court in 1992, Cole said. \"The only difference between then and now is the identity of the justices,\" he said. Jeff Wall, a top Justice Department lawyer under Trump, said the court could sharply expand gun rights and end the use of race in college admissions, but only abortion is likely to move public perception of the court. \"I still dont think thats going to create some groundswell in the public, unless its accompanied by some kind of watershed ruling on abortion,\" Wall said. In early November, the court will take up a challenge to New York restrictions on carrying a gun in public, a case that offers the court the chance to expand gun rights under the Second Amendment. Before Barrett joined the court, the justices turned away similar cases, over the dissents of some conservative members of the court. Until Barrett came along, some justices who favor gun rights questioned whether Chief Justice John Roberts would provide a fifth, majority-making vote \"for a more expansive reading of the Second Amendment,\" said George Washington University law professor Robert Cottrol, who said he hoped the court would now broaden gun rights. More than 40 states already make it easy to be armed in public, but New York and California, two of the nation\\'s most populous states, are among the few with tighter regulations. The case has gun control advocates worried. \"An expansive Second Amendment ruling by the Supreme Court could restrict or prohibit the sensible solutions that have been shown can end gun violence,\" said Jonathan Lowy, vice president and chief counsel at the gun violence prevention group Brady. Lowy included state laws requiring a justification to carry a gun as examples of such \"sensible solutions.\" A case from Maine gives the court another opportunity to weigh religious rights in the area of education. The state excludes religious schools from a tuition program for families who live in towns that don\\'t have public schools. Since even before Ginsburg\\'s death, the court has favored religion-based discrimination claims and the expectation among legal experts is that parents in Maine who sued to be able to use taxpayer money at religious schools will prevail, though it\\'s not clear how broadly the court might rule. Affirmative action is not yet on the court\\'s agenda, but it could still get there this term in a lawsuit over Harvard\\'s use of race in college admissions. Lower courts upheld the school\\'s policy, but this is another case in which the change in the composition of the court could prove decisive. The court upheld race-conscious admission policies as recently as five years ago but that was before Trump\\'s three appointments accentuated the court\\'s conservative tilt. Among other notable cases, the justices will consider reinstating the death sentence for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The Biden administration is pushing for the capital sentence, even as it has suspended federal executions and President Joe Biden has called for an end to the federal death penalty. The court will also weigh two cases involving \"state secrets,\" the idea that the government can block the release of information it claims would harm national security if disclosed. One case involves a Guantanamo Bay detainee who a lower court said was tortured in CIA custody. The other involves a group of Muslim residents of California who allege the FBI targeted them for surveillance because of their religion. Decisions in the most of the big cases won\\'t come before spring because the justices typically spend months drafting and revising majority opinions and dissents. Around then, Breyer might signal whether he is planning to retire from a job he has held since 1994. Retirement announcements often come in the spring, to give the president and the Senate enough time to choose and confirm a nominee before the court returns from its summer break and begins hearing cases again in October. The consequences of Ginsburg\\'s decision to remain on the court through Barack Obama\\'s presidency and her death while Trump was in the White House can\\'t be lost on Breyer, said Tom Goldstein, the founder of the Scotusblog website and a frequent advocate before the court. \"It\\'s overwhelmingly likely hell retire this term,\" Goldstein said. The courthouse still is closed to the public, but live audio of the court\\'s arguments will be available and reporters who regularly cover the court will be in attendance. The tradition-bound court first provided live audio in May 2020, when the court began hearing arguments by telephone during the pandemic. Justice Brett Kavanaugh will participate remotely from his home next week during oral arguments after testing positive for COVID-19 despite being vaccinated. The court said Friday that the 54-year-old justice has no symptoms. ------ Associated Press writer Jessica Gresko contributed to this report.\\nShe was an animal lover in Kentucky who was a \"bright ray of sunshine\" to all who knew her. He was a father of two and \"young soul\" in Florida who could often be found out on the water on his boat. They were excited about the next chapters in their lives -- for her, a wedding; for him, his first grandchild. Samantha Wendell and Shane O\\'Neal both also resisted getting vaccinated against COVID-19 for months, stemming from feelings of either fear or fearlessness, before deciding to make an appointment to get the shot. But before they could, they contracted COVID-19 and, following weeks of severe illness, died last month after doctors exhausted all options, their families said. Their two tragic tales were shared publicly on social media and to news outlets by grieving family members trying to make sense of what happened, and maybe prevent others from going through the same loss. They also represent a population that public health experts are still trying to reach, as millions in the United States remain unvaccinated against COVID-19 as the more contagious delta variant continues to spread. \\'Misinformation killed my cousin\\' Days after returning home from her Nashville bachelorette party in July, Wendell, a surgical technician from Grand Rapids, started to feel sick, her cousin, Maria Vibandor Hayes, told ABC News. Her fiance, Austin Eskew, also fell ill, she said, about a month before the two college sweethearts were set to tie the knot on Aug. 21. Eskew recovered, but Wendell\\'s illness progressed to the point where she was having trouble breathing and needed to be hospitalized the second week in August, according to Vibandor Hayes. The next month was a \"rollercoaster\" of progress and setbacks, her cousin said. Wendell was moved to a hospital in Indiana, where she was put on a BPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) machine to help with her breathing, but the week of her wedding she was intubated and put on a ventilator, Vibandor Hayes said. After a few more weeks of ups and downs, Wendell\\'s condition didn\\'t improve and doctors told the family they had done everything they possibly could, her cousin said. She died on Sept. 10 from COVID-19 at the age of 29. \"I didn\\'t think that this would be our story,\" Vibandor Hayes said. \"Surely, we\\'re gonna have a wedding to attend before the end of the year, Sam is gonna wake up and she\\'ll be better and we\\'re going to celebrate and live life. But that was not what was the case.\" \"I just never want another family to experience what our family has gone through, to say goodbye to somebody on the phone,\" she said. It was particularly hard to see what her cousin went through because Vibandor Hayes is a COVID-19 long hauler, after contracting the virus in March 2020. \"I remember how I felt, I remember how I thought I could possibly die,\" said Vibandor Hayes, who still suffers from brain fog. The couple had appointments to get vaccinated after Wendell returned from her bachelorette party, but then they both got sick, Vibandor Hayes said. They had previously hesitated due to concerns of infertility, but Wendell\\'s mother had encouraged them to get vaccinated ahead of their wedding and honeymoon, the cousin said. Wendell was not alone in her fears of the vaccine -- others have hesitated on getting the shot due to unfounded rumors that it might lead to infertility. Medical experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have stressed there is no link between the vaccines and fertility. \"Misinformation killed my cousin,\" Vibandor Hayes said. \"She is a smart young woman, she always has been. I feel like if she was able to look at things from another perspective and that if she had all the information at her hand, that she would have eventually not hesitated for so long.\" Delta variant a turning point O\\'Neal was an avid outdoorsman who could often be found fishing, jet skiing or hunting, his daughter, Kylie Dean, told ABC News. The resident of Maxville, outside Jacksonville, wasn\\'t too concerned about getting vaccinated against COVID-19 -- he mostly kept to himself on his boat when he wasn\\'t at his construction company, Dean said. \"He knew [COVID-19] was real, and he knew what was going on, but I don\\'t think he lived his life in fear of it,\" Dean said. The \"turning point,\" she said, was the delta variant, which has fueled a surge of cases and hospitalizations, particularly in the Jacksonville area. \"He knew people affected by it, that it\\'s not something that\\'s going away, it\\'s actually coming back with a vengeance almost,\" Dean said. \"So that\\'s why he was like, you know what, I\\'m just going to go ahead and do it.\" The week O\\'Neal planned to get the vaccine, though, he tested positive for COVID-19 in early August, his daughter said. He was hospitalized a week later and eventually put on a ventilator. He was a good candidate for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, a last resort for COVID-19 patients, though his hospital didn\\'t have the machine available, Dean said. After she put out a plea for an ECMO bed, doctors were able to find him one. But his condition deteriorated, and he died in the early morning hours of Sept. 3 at the age of 40. About 20 minutes after he died, Dean gave birth to her baby boy, O\\'Neal\\'s first grandchild. \"I literally broke down, hysterically crying,\" Dean said of when she got the call that her dad was going to pass soon. \"I didn\\'t want him to die alone.\" The family is still \"in shock,\" Dean said. Her father was young and had no comorbidities, but his illness progressed rapidly. Dean, an intensive care unit nurse, hopes to improve access to ECMO therapy and has been speaking out to warn others about the virus and urge them to protect themselves. \"It\\'s a monster and people need to be careful,\" she told ABC News Jacksonville affiliate WJXX. Personal perspective Wendell\\'s and O\\'Neal\\'s stories are akin to others shared by family members. Other recent reports of people who planned to get vaccinated but died after contracting COVID-19 include a 53-year-old former Texas councilman, a 39-year-old Illinois teacher, a 48-year-old teacher in Florida, and a 20-year-old college student in North Carolina. Nearly all COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are among people who are unvaccinated, as health care workers and in some cases those hospitalized themselves plead for vaccination. As of Wednesday, some 70 million people who are eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine remain unvaccinated, according to federal data. Over 65% of those ages 12 and up are fully vaccinated nationwide, which is low considering the level of access to free vaccines in the U.S., Rupali Limaye, director of Behavioral and Implementation Science at the International Vaccine Access Center, based at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told ABC News. At this stage, two main forces may get someone who is hesitant vaccinated, Limaye said -- one is hearing about someone regretting not getting the vaccine, the other a vaccine mandate. \"If someone they know themselves is dealing with a very severe case, and someone they know dies from it or they\\'re close to death, I think that tends to change their mind,\" Limaye said. \"Or the vaccine mandate, because then that\\'s sort of an economic sanction.\" Hesitancy continues to be fueled by safety concerns and distrust of the vaccine development process, as well as the belief that preventative measures are unnecessary, she said. Public health experts continue to work to dispel misinformation, but hearing personal stories could be impactful. \"If it is someone that you know where you can hear from a friend, \\'This is what happened to my mom,\\' I think that puts it into perspective for people a lot versus just public health folks saying you should get it,\" Limaye said. \"I think it makes it much more real.\" Vibandor Hayes said she has received \"hate mail\" from strangers after urging people to get vaccinated, but wants to continue to speak out to help prevent another family from experiencing the same heartbreak. \"If this is the gift she has left us, to share with others, then that\\'s what we\\'ll do,\" Vibandor Hayes said.\\nThe United States reached another grim milestone on Friday, as the confirmed coronavirus death toll topped 700,000, just over a year and a half into the pandemic, and despite the wide availability of vaccines. The milestone, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, comes less than two weeks after the national death toll surpassed the estimated number of fatalities in the U.S. during the 1918 influenza pandemic. Despite national COVID-19 metrics showing encouraging signs of decline, approximately 1,500 Americans are dying from the virus every day, according to federal data. \"Reaching 700,000 deaths is a tragic and completely avoidable milestone. We had the knowledge and the tools to prevent this from happening, and unfortunately politics, lack of urgency and mistrust in science got us here,\" said John Brownstein, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Boston Children\\'s Hospital and ABC News contributor. To put it in perspective, the staggering number of deaths is greater than the number of Americans who were estimated to have died of cancer last year, one of the nation\\'s leading causes of death. It\\'s higher than the total number of American troops who have died in battle throughout the recent history of the country, and it is about the same as the population of Boston, Massachusetts. Some experts believe that the current COVID-19 death count could already be greatly undercounted, due to inconsistent reporting by states and localities, and the exclusion of excess deaths, a measure of how many lives have been lost beyond what would be expected if the pandemic had not occurred. The country\\'s four largest states -- California, Texas, New York and Florida -- all have recorded more than 50,000 deaths, close to a third of the overall total. Once \\'unimaginable\\' The COVID death toll is now seven times what former President Donald Trump once predicted in the early days of the pandemic. \"The minimum number was 100,000 lives, and I think we\\'ll be substantially under that number. ... So we\\'ll see what it ends up being, but it looks like we\\'re headed to a number substantially below 100,000,\" Trump said in April 2020. However, many health experts, including Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University, already were concerned at the onset of the pandemic of the potentially devastating impact of the virus. \"My team and I could see very early on that this pathogen had the potential to kill this many people in the U.S. ... I did not anticipate just how fractious the response would be, how leaders would not be able to or interested in unifying the country to come together and overcome political differences in order to combat the virus,\" Shaman said. \"I\\'m saddened this did not happen. I think if it had, fewer people would have died and the economic consequences of the pandemic would also have been lessened.\" Each death is a unique tragedy and an irreparable loss. An analysis, tracking the extensive reach of COVID-19 loss of kin with a bereavement multiplier, published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, estimates that 6.3 million family members may be grieving the loss of a loved one due to the virus. Patricia Dowd, a 57-year-old San Jose resident, was the first known American to die of COVID-19 in February 2020. At first, Dowd\\'s cause of death was not known to be from the virus. It was only months later, in April, when an autopsy would reveal that she had died of coronavirus, three weeks before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had previously identified the first American coronavirus-related death. By late May of 2020, 100,000 Americans had been confirmed dead. In the months to come, the U.S. would log another 100,000 coronavirus deaths, and by the time a coronavirus vaccine was authorized for emergency use, a total of 300,000 Americans had died from it. When President Joe Biden took office in January, the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 had swelled to 400,000, and just a month later half a million Americans had died. By June, it was 600,000 Americans. \"A year and half ago, the idea of hitting 700,000 coronavirus deaths was completely unimaginable. While these horrific milestones were once a reflection of the failures of public health response, they are now a reflection of our inability to get millions of vulnerable Americans vaccinated,\" Brownstein said. Lower demand for vaccines The milestone is juxtaposed with a drop in demand in among Americans getting vaccines, with the current rate of new vaccinations nearing its lowest point since the shots were introduced last December. Approximately 117.4 million Americans remain completely unvaccinated, nearly 70 million of whom are over the age of 12 and eligible for a vaccine. On average, the number of Americans receiving a newly authorized Pfizer third dose is now higher than the number of Americans initiating a vaccination each day. \"Heading into the winter months, we can significantly delay the next grim milestone if more people, especially those at high risk for severe illness, choose to get vaccinated,\" said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist and associate professor of population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Earlier this week, the CDC released new data illustrating that, overall, vaccines are still dramatically reducing the risk of being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 during the current delta variant surge, same as before. People who have not been fully vaccinated are eight times more likely to test positive, 41 times more likely to be hospitalized, and 57 times more likely to die, compared with people who are vaccinated, according to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky \"We are laser-focused on getting more shots in arms, particularly to vaccinate the unvaccinated. That\\'s our path out of this pandemic. So if you\\'re unvaccinated, please go get a shot. It\\'s free, it\\'s safe, it\\'s easy. It\\'ll help make all of us safer,\" Walensky said at a press conference on Friday. Disproportionate impact Racial and ethnic minorities in the country have borne a disproportionate share of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. According to federal data, adjusted for age and population, the likelihood of death because of COVID-19, for Black, Latino and Native American people is two to three times that of white people. Although the metrics seem to show that the latest wave of the pandemic may be abating, experts caution. \"We are not in the clear,\" Shaman said. \"New variants may arise that cause more breakthrough and repeat infections, and the virus appears to be innately more transmissible during winter.\" Experts who spoke to ABC News agreed that it\\'s critical for more Americans to get vaccinated. \"The vast majority of deaths going forward will continue to be those that elected to delay vaccination,\" Brownstein added. \"While the current downward trajectory of cases provides an optimistic outlook, this path will unfortunately continue to include tens of thousands of vaccine-preventable deaths.\"\\nA federal court on Thursday ordered the Federal Election Commission to rule on pending complaints that allege the National Rifle Association used shell entities to illegally coordinate campaign spending with federal candidates, including with the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump. In 2019, the Washington-based nonpartisan watchdog group Campaign Legal Center Action sued the FEC on behalf of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun-control advocacy group led by former Democratic Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, after the federal agency failed to act on multiple complaints that accused the gun rights group of perpetrating what plaintiffs called \"an elaborate scheme ... to unlawfully coordinate with candidates it supports for federal office.\" The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday ordered the FEC to take action on the complaints within 30 days. In the 2019 suit, the plaintiffs alleged that the NRA used a \"network of shell corporations\" to circumvent contribution limits and coordinate approximately $35 million in ad spending with the campaigns of at least seven Republican candidates over the last three election cycles, \"thereby making millions of dollars of illegal, unreported, and excessive in-kind contributions.\" The complaint alleged that while the NRA deliberately circumvented FEC rules that prohibit vendor coordination between campaigns and outside groups, the federal agency responsible for oversight of election spending -- whose members frequently deadlock on matters along partisan lines -- had not taken any enforcement action. \"The failure of the FEC to enforce our campaign finance laws has resulted in an explosion of shady campaign spending,\" said Trevor Potter, the president of Campaign Legal Center Action CLC and a former FEC chairman. \"The FEC had the chance to do the right thing by taking action against the NRA for this blatant spending coordination, but failed to do so.\" \"This is a baseless effort engineered by anti-gun groups who want to silence the voices of our members,\" NRA spokesperson Lars Dalseide told ABC News in a statement. \"We welcome the FEC\\'s review so we can move on from this frivolous distraction.\" A spokesperson for the FEC declined to comment on the litigation. FEC rules prohibit outside groups from making coordinated expenditures with campaigns, stipulating that candidate campaigns should not be \"materially involved\" in the production and placement of ads purchased by the super PAC arm or the politically active nonprofit arm of the NRA. Vendors that are shared by the NRA and federal campaigns are also prohibited from sharing information in support of each other. \"Over the last several years and across election cycles, the NRA has been brazenly flouting campaign finance law by illegally funneling money to candidates while claiming to remain independent,\" said David Pucino, senior staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \"It is clear that the NRA will continue to violate the law until someone stops them,\" Pucino said. \"Today\\'s decision ordering the FEC to take action is a resounding win to keep dark money out of our politics.\"\\nIn today\\'s world of permanent campaigning, \"leadership PACs\" -- political action committees established by individual politicians -- have served as an invaluable vehicle for members of Congress to support their political allies. Leadership PACs were approved in 1978 as a way for politicians to raise money and then make contributions to other candidates. The money cannot be used on a politician\\'s own election expenses. But a new report by the good-government groups Campaign Legal Center and Issue One shows that numerous lawmakers have been dedicating most of their leadership PAC spending to overhead and fundraising for the PAC -- often at fancy restaurants and luxury resorts -- while spending comparatively little on actual contributions to other candidates or political allies. During the 2020 election cycle, there were at least 120 members of Congress whose leadership PACs reported that less than 50% of their spending was in the form of political contributions to other candidates, political allies, or parties, according to the report. Of those, 43 members\\' leadership PACs devoted less than 25% of their overall spending to political contributions during that cycle, while a handful of members\\' leadership PACs spent more than five figures without making any political contributions whatsoever. Early in 2019, then-North Carolina GOP Rep. George Holding\\'s leadership PAC made two such contributions, giving a total of $5,000 to a fellow North Carolina Republican House hopeful running in a GOP primary. But a few months later in December, Holding announced that he would not seek reelection in 2020 -- and that $5,000 remained the PAC\\'s only political contributions throughout the 2020 cycle. All the while, Holding\\'s PAC continued to rake in contributions from supporters, while the PAC spent nearly $200,000 on airfare and car services and on food and drink at restaurants and clubs, including the exclusive East India Club in London and the Union Club in New York City, according to the report. The report notes that none of the donor funds beyond the $5,000 contributions went toward supporting Holding\\'s political allies. \"Most members of Congress use their leadership PAC for their intended purposes -- aiding other candidates, their parties, and political allies,\" Issue One Research Director Michael Beckel told ABC News. For a typical member, Beckel said, 70% of their leadership PAC\\'s expenditures go toward political expenditures. But other members use their leadership PAC funds to spend lavishly on expensive meals, trips to elite resorts and rounds of golf at premier courses, which is \"purportedly done for the purpose of political fundraising,\" Beckel and his co-authors wrote in the report. However, the authors wrote, \"this explanation rings hollow when just a fraction of the money raised goes toward political contributions.\" \"Some politicians are simply raising money at one posh location to pay for the next fundraiser at the next fancy destination -- creating an endless fundraising cycle at luxurious restaurants and resorts, much of which is paid for by special interest money, with no cost to lawmakers\\' own pocketbooks,\" the authors wrote. When Holding launched his leadership PAC, Conservative Roundtable, in 2014, it devoted nearly 70% of its funds to supporting fellow Republicans running for office that year, past disclosure filings show. But over the years, according to the report, the PAC gradually spent less and less on supporting GOP allies. Out of the $202,000 the PAC spent in the last election cycle -- besides the $5,000 in political contributions and the funds spent on social clubs, airfare and lodging -- the bulk of the PAC\\'s expenditures went to a fundraising firm. Holding\\'s PAC did not respond to ABC News\\' request for comment, but the then-congressman told CQ Roll Call in a statement last year that as co-chair of the U.K. Caucus and co-chair of the British American Parliamentary Group, he \"traveled to London at no expense to the taxpayer for the purpose of developing and maintaining a leadership role on U.K./U.S. issues.\" \"In addition, I have developed a supporter base with the American expatriate community in the U.K,\" Holding said in the statement. It\\'s unclear from the report or from committee disclosure filings if his trips to London were paid for by his leadership PAC. GOP Sen. Rand Paul\\'s leadership PAC, Reinventing a New Direction, spent only 12% of its expenditures on political contributions out of the nearly $1 million it spent during the 2020 cycle, according to the report, with a big chunk of the PAC\\'s money going to political research and consulting, as well as to fundraising. Tens of thousands of dollars of Paul\\'s PAC money also went to travel, lodging and meals at high-end establishments, including The Breakers, a five-star resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and BLT Prime at former President Donald Trump\\'s hotel in Washington, D.C. Paul\\'s PAC also spent money on tickets at Nationals Park, home of Washington\\'s Major League Baseball team, and at Karlstejn Castle, a tourist destination outside Prague in the Czech Republic, according to the report. Paul\\'s spokesperson did not respond to ABC News\\' request for comment. Wisconsin Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore\\'s leadership PAC also reported using just 12% of its total spending during the 2020 election cycle on direct political contributions, while spending tens of thousands of dollars on fundraising, lodging and airfare. The PAC spent roughly $32,000 on meals and catering, including thousands of dollars at steakhouses and for delivery services, and spent thousands of dollars on event tickets purchased through Live Nation, StubHub and Ticketmaster, according to the report. Moore\\'s PAC did not respond to ABC News\\' request for comment. While some PACs may be skimping on direct political contributions to political allies, a number of lawmakers say they\\'ve found other ways for their PACs to support their political interests. GOP Sen. Ted Cruz\\' leadership PAC, while spending just 18% of its $2.2 million in total expenditures on directly supporting other Republican candidates and political groups in the 2020 cycle, spent more than 70% of its funds on media buys and online advertising promoting Republican political causes. Cruz\\' spokesperson told ABC News that \"in addition to making direct contributions to candidates, his strong fundraising has permitted Jobs, Freedom & Security PAC to go above and beyond the typical Leadership PAC by investing heavily in advertisements and messaging that empower and help give voice to the conservative movement.\" Cruz\\' PAC also spent more than $12,000 for facility and equipment rentals from the Houston Astros baseball team, as well as big sums on airfare and boutique hotels, according to the report. Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton\\'s two leadership PACs reported spending just 8% on political contributions out of their combined total expenditures of $1.7 million during the 2020 cycle, with the vast majority of their funds being spent on salaries, consulting and fundraising. In contrast, during the 2016 cycle, the majority of Moulton\\'s Serve America PAC money -- more than 84% -- went to other Democratic campaigns, past campaign disclosure filings show. Moulton, however, told ABC News in a statement that his PACs\\' political contributions to Democratic allies were lower in the 2020 election cycle because he had been mobilizing his donors to contribute directly to other candidates rather than asking them to cut a check to his PACs to then be forwarded along. Through this strategy, Moulton said, his team raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for then-candidate Joe Biden\\'s presidential campaign and for Democratic Georgia Senate candidates.\\nTexas\\' recent effective ban on almost all abortions was not only controversial but unusual as well, containing a provision incentivizing people to report violators, even if they are not directly connected to the procedure. Some are already trying to test the law, with former lawyers from out of state suing a doctor who defied the ban. Both have said that they are not anti-abortion and want the courts to weigh in on the law\\'s validity. A sum of at least $10,000 is at stake for those who bring successful legal action. The Texas law is just the latest and most prominent in a red-state wave of legislation being proposed or enacted deputizing and financially motivating everyday citizens to help enforce laws, even in cases where they can claim no damages, a usual barrier for legal action. And unlike whistleblower laws, for instance, experts say this type of legislation is designed to suppress the constitutionally protected rights of others. Some proponents say that they are a hedge against the encroachment of liberal policymakers. In Tennessee, students and parents can sue school districts that violate a law approved this year by Republican Gov. Bill Lee banning transgender students from using communal public restrooms of the sex with which they identify. In Florida, students and parents can drag public school officials and coaches to civil court for letting transgender girls compete on female sports teams under a law approved by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. \"It\\'s not just about abortion. It\\'s about all these other spaces of controlling a person\\'s reproductive health, their well-being and constraining them to a particular point of view which is not consistent with the United States Constitution,\" Michele Bratcher Goodwin, the chancellor\\'s law professor at the University of California, Irvine, told ABC News. \"It\\'s more aligned with the kind of orthodoxy we have not seen in terms of religion since the Salem Witch Trials.\" The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ civil rights organization, said more than 100 bills have been proposed or enacted in 33 states in 2021 alone that are designed to curb the rights of transgender people, the most tallied in the 15 years the organization has been keeping track of such legislation. No private citizens appear to have yet filed litigation to enforce the transgender laws that the Human Rights Watch Campaign argues discriminate on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the U.S. Constitution. Lawmakers in several states where Republicans control legislatures, including Arkansas, Idaho, South Dakota and Indiana -- have publicly expressed an interest in using Texas\\' so-called \"heartbeat act\" as a model for legislation. A Florida GOP state representative became the first to introduce a copycat bill last week.\" $10,000 \\'bounty\\' Ryan Bomberger, the co-founder of The Radiance Foundation, an anti-abortion faith-based nonprofit group, told ABC News that laws being passed in states where Republicans hold political sway are empowering parents like him to fight back against what they see as liberal values that have been foisted on them for decades. \"The Texas heartbeat act is a democratically passed law. Civilians being able to enforce a law is not new. It happens in a lot of different cases. That\\'s why people can bring a civil suit in a wrongful-murder situation for instance,\" he added. Rutgers University Law School professor David Noll told ABC News that the new breed of laws deploys somewhat similar mechanisms enabling private citizens to enforce legislation like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, laws enacted in the 1970s to protect people and private property against environmental damage. But he said those laws were intended to operate as a check on the government\\'s enforcement or its failure to enforce the laws, and require litigants to show damages. \"Thats not at all analogous to whats happening in these new laws,\" Noll said. \"These new laws are saying its private enforcement and private enforcement only.\" Noll and Jon Michaels, a law professor at UCLA, have been tracking what they call \"rights-suppressing laws\" that have been sweeping red states. In an essay published last month in the New York Times, Noll and Michaels argued that the laws are deputizing private individuals to wage a \"seemingly endless battle to deny disfavored groups equal citizenship.\" \"Theyve inverted private enforcement laws -- marshaled over the years to discipline fraudulent government contractors, racist or sexist bosses and toxic polluters -- to enable individuals to suppress the rights of their neighbors, classmates and colleagues,\" Noll and Michaels wrote. In an interview with ABC News, Noll said he expects red-state lawmakers to continue to push the envelope of what he described as legalized vigilantism. He said it wouldn\\'t be surprising if soon private individuals will be empowered to bring state lawsuits in other rights-suppressing situations such as handing out water to minority voters waiting in lines at the polls or suing landlords who house undocumented people. \"Whats unifying these laws is the fact that they\\'re empowering private parties to litigate really moral objections to the way that other people are living their lives,\" Noll said. \"Theyre fomenting grievances, they\\'re fomenting social division. These laws are about suppressing the rights of other people. Thats the thread that we see running through these laws.\" \\'Unprecedented\\' The law that has made the biggest waves recently is Texas\\' so-called \"heartbeat act\" prohibiting abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy even in cases where conception resulted from rape, sexual assault or incest. The law outlines a legal mechanism of relying on private citizens filing lawsuits to enforce it, as opposed to state officials or law enforcement. The law not only allows private individuals to sue doctors they allege are providing abortions but also healthcare workers who assist and anyone else who aids and abets in the process, including Uber drivers who take passengers to appointments to get abortions. The Texas law also provides what opponents describe as a \"bounty\" of at least $10,000, plus legal fees, to anyone who is successful in enforcing the law through the courts, creating a chilling effect on abortion providers who have suddenly stopped offering services. The novel legal maneuver makes the law hard to strike down in court because it\\'s designed to \"insulate the state from responsibility for implementing and enforcing the regulatory regime,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a dissenting opinion in a narrow Supreme Court 5-4 ruling on Sept. 1. The ruling denied an emergency appeal from abortion providers and others that sought to block enforcement of the Texas law. Roberts said the law\\'s enforcement mechanism was \"not only unusual but unprecedented.\" U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland responded by filing a federal lawsuit against Texas seeking a permanent injunction against the law, calling it \"clearly unconstitutional under long-standing Supreme Court precedent.\" \"The obvious and expressly acknowledged intention of this statutory scheme is to prevent women from exercising their Constitutional rights by thwarting judicial review for as long as possible,\" Garland said at a Sept. 9 news conference. \"This kind of scheme to nullify the Constitution of the United States is one that all Americans, whatever their politics or party, should fear.\" He warned that if the law prevails, it could \"become a model for action in other areas by other states and with respect to other constitutional rights and judicial precedent.\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who signed the bill into law in May, is confident the courts will uphold the law, according to a spokesperson for the governor. \"The most precious freedom is life itself. Texas passed a law that ensures that the life of every child with a heartbeat will be spared from the ravages of abortion,\" Renae Eze, Abbott\\'s spokesperson, said in a statement. \\'Deeply constitutional\\' or \\'incredibly punitive\\' For Bomberger, the debate over the Texas law is deeply personal and goes to the heart of the Constitution. \"The preamble of the Constitution says the reason why we do all these things is to secure the blessing of liberty for whom? For ourselves and our posterity, those yet to be born,\" Bomberger told ABC News. \"So, its deeply constitutional to protect our posterity.\" Bomberger said he was conceived as a result of rape and praised his birth mother who \"courageously not only gave me the gift of life but gave me the incredible gift of adoption.\" \"That same heart and that same mentality, that world view, continues and thats why were in this fight. Were fighting against a judiciary that in essence legalized commercial killing of the unborn,\" Bomberger said. On the other hand, Goodwin -- author of a book published last year titled \"Policing The Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood\" -- said the Texas abortion law is \"incredibly punitive for anybody who has a uterus.\" She said it is disproportionately harmful to the health of poor Black and Hispanic women who may not be able to afford to travel out of state to seek an abortion or other medical care groups such as Planned Parenthood provides like contraceptive care, prenatal and postnatal care, and screenings for breast, cervical and ovarian cancer. Goodwin also told ABC News she believes that the law has \"eerie similarities\" to the Fugitive Slave laws and Jim Crow laws of the 1800s, which were passed by state legislatures and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. \"What they provided for was that random individuals could go hunt, surveil, stalk, spy on, and capture Black people who were seeking to be free. It provided incentivized financial rewards for individuals who were successful in doing this,\" Goodwin said. \"Where are we now? In Texas, there is a law that has been passed that provides bounty just like the Fugitive Slave Act did. It incentivizes, it legalizes individuals spying on their neighbors, tracking their neighbors, reporting their neighbors, and taking them to the court of their choice, again, like the Fugitive Slave Act, making it easy for the bounty hunters.\" Bomberger, who is African American, agreed with Goodwin\\'s analogy, but for an entirely different reason. \"There are no two cases in American jurisprudence that are any closer than Dred Scott and Roe v. Wade, where you had the Supreme Court rule that certain human beings of my complexion were less than human, therefore they could be sold, traded, killed,\" Bomberger said. \"The same decision, 7 to 2, in a later Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade said, \\'Yes, this group of human beings, well theyre not really humans and we can do whatever we want with them.\\'\"\\nAfter two days of Democratic infighting and drama, the fate of President Joe Biden\\'s infrastructure agenda remained unclear after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had to repeatedly put off a vote on a bipartisan infrastructure bill because progressive Democrats had vowed to vote against it -- unless there\\'s a deal on a larger spending package. After voting to approve a 30-day extension of federal highway and transit funding, House members were told late Friday that they could return home for a two-week recess. But they were put on 72-hours\\' notice for the possibility of votes on various legislation, including infrastructure. Overnight, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D- N.J. and co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, railed against Pelosi, issuing a statement saying, \"Its deeply regrettable that Speaker Pelosi breached her firm, public commitment to Members of Congress and the American people to hold a vote and to pass the once-in-a-century bipartisan infrastructure bill on or before September 27.\" \"We cannot let this small faction on the far left -- who employ Freedom Caucus tactics, as described by the New York Times today -- destroy the Presidents agenda and stop the creation of two million jobs a year -- including for the millions of hard-working men and women of labor,\" he added. The feuding has so jeopardized Biden\\'s top legislative priorities that he went to Capitol Hill Friday afternoon to meet with House Democrats to make clear he wants both the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and the $3.5 trillion social safety net and climate policy measure to pass. \"It doesnt matter when. It doesnt matter whether its in six minutes, six days, or six weeks. Were gonna get it done,\" Biden told reporters as he emerged. Behind closed doors, Biden suggested that a smaller topline social policy bill price tag ranging from $1.9-$2.2 trillion could be the compromise in tense negotiations involving the White House, Democratic progressives, moderates and two key Senate Democrats, according to sources in the room. Such an investment, together with the $1.2 trillion bipartisan highway bill, would still be a huge investment, he told the caucus, the sources said. \"Even a smaller bill can make historic investments,\" they quoted Biden as saying. The bipartisan infrastructure bill \"aint going to happen until we reach an agreement on the next piece of legislation,\" he added, according to the sources. \"Lets try to figure out what we are for in reconciliation ... and then we can move ahead.\" He made clear he campaigned on the proposals in the larger package, they said, but did not suggest or endorse a specific timeline for votes in the House or Senate. One Democrat inside the room told ABC News Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott they were \"massively disappointed.\" Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the lawmaker told her \"when the president of the United States comes, it\\'s to close the deal -- not to say hello.\" The member added, \"Most of us are at a loss for words. There was no plan. No strategy. No timing.\" Earlier Friday, Pelosi and House Democrats held another caucus meeting for more than two-and-a-half hours as they tried to find a path forward on their policy agenda after Democratic leadership and the White House failed to bring progressives and moderates together behind the president\\'s broader agenda. Inside that closed-door gathering, which typically has the feel of a pep rally-turned-group therapy session, Pelosi seized the opportunity to take the temperature of her caucus. Centrist members from swing districts pushed for an immediate vote on the Senate-passed infrastructure bill. Progressives insisted that they will block it unless the Senate first approves the massive social policy package - hardening the stance they have taken for several weeks. \"No. We need a vote,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said outside the morning caucus meeting. \"We need to be real. Are we going to deliver universal pre-K to this country, or not? Are we going to expand health care to our seniors and improve vision and dental, or not?\" Pelosi told members that Democrats ought to move quickly and that the situation was \"perishable,\" according to sources familiar with her comments. \"We cannot and I will not ask you to vote for the BIF (Capitol Hill shorthand for bipartisan infrastructure framework) until we have the best possible offering that we can stick with,\" Pelosi told Democrats. \"And it\\'s not just me. This is about the president of the United States.\" \"So, that\\'s why it is our intention to bring up the vote today. It is our intention to win the vote today,\" she added, according to sources familiar with her comments. As she arrived at the Capitol Friday morning, ABC News asked Pelosi whether she was trying to get members on board by promising a second reconciliation bill early next year in an effort to appease members now, after vowing again on Thursday that a reconciliation bill would follow the vote on the bipartisan package. \"I don\\'t know about that but a reconciliation bill is not excluded. It\\'s not necessarily connected to this,\" she said. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer arrived a minute ahead of Pelosi, telling reporters only \"we\\'ll see\" when asked whether the House would vote on the measure before the end of the day. Pelosi had insisted for two mornings that she planned to go ahead with a vote on the Senate-passed $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., exiting the morning caucus meeting on Friday, said she\\'s \"seen more progress in the last 48 hours than we\\'ve seen in a long time on reconciliation.\" She reiterated the progressives\\' position that they\\'ll vote \"no\" unless there is agreement with the moderate Democratic senators on a larger social spending package to accompany it. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who along with and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. object to the larger bill\\'s cost, told reporters on Thursday he already conveyed to leadership his topline number is $1.5 trillion -- far below progressives $3.5 trillion number.\\nLawyers from the Justice Department and the state of Texas squared off in court Friday as the Biden administration seeks an order that would halt enforcement of the state\\'s restrictive abortion law that took effect exactly one month ago. It was the first court hearing on the matter and presents the first opportunity for a judge to get abortion rights fully restored in Texas, at least temporarily. In an overnight filing, DOJ officials accused Texas of mounting a \"brazen\" effort to enact a law purely designed to obstruct women\\'s right to an abortion while evading all traditional methods of judicial review. \"S.B. 8s novel enforcement scheme is calculated to accomplish what no state should be able to do in our federal system: deter, suppress, and render moot rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States,\" department officials said in its filing. \"The State does not dispute that S.B. 8 has virtually eliminated previability abortions after six weeks of pregnancy in the State. Moreover, the approach Texas has taken need not be confined to the abortion context. If this mechanism works here, it would serve as a blueprint for the suppression of nearly any other constitutional right recognized by the Supreme Court but resented by a state government.\" SB8, or the \\'Texas Heartbeat Act,\\' bars physicians from providing abortions once they detect a so-called fetal heartbeat -- which can be seen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. But the language of the law makes it so private citizens can sue anyone they \"reasonably believed\" provided an abortion, and effectively removes any government officials from being part of its enforcement. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced last month that the Justice Department would sue Texas over its law just one week after the U.S. Supreme Court let it take effect. Soon after, the department filed for an emergency injunction seeking to halt enforcement of the law entirely as the legal fight plays out. In a filing Wednesday, Texas officials urged District Judge Robert Pitman, a 2014 Obama-appointee, who consented to rare live streaming of the hearing on Zoom to members of the press given the high public interest, to dismiss DOJ\\'s request for an injunction -- arguing the Biden administration had no standing to bring it before a federal judge and that the matter should instead be resolved before state courts. \"The federal government asks the Court to dispense with the normal cause-of-action requirement based on unfounded fears that the Texas Heartbeat Act will otherwise \\'evade judicial review.\\' Nothing could be further from the truth,\" officials wrote in their filing. \"The constitutionality of the Texas Heartbeat Act can be reviewed in the same way that virtually all of state tort law is: State-court defendants raise constitutional defenses before neutral judges sworn to follow the U.S. Constitution and, if necessary, appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\" Also in their brief, Texas officials made an eyebrow-raising counterargument to DOJ\\'s contention that the abortion law hinders interstate commerce -- the state instead pointed to reports of women seeking an abortion being forced to travel out of the Texas to Oklahoma, saying that \"is stimulating rather than obstructing interstate travel.\" Appearing on behalf of the state of Texas, Will Thompson, deputy chief for litigation in the AG\\'s office, said the DOJ\\'s allegation that the state enabled an \"unprecedented scheme of vigilante justice\" was \"completely untrue.\" \"There\\'s nothing unprecedented about private individuals enforcing state tort law rights in state court, and state tort law defendants being allowed to raise constitutional defenses, and if necessary, appeal up to the state court system to the US Supreme Court,\" Thompson said. \"Nothing happens to a defendant in a heartbeat lawsuit until a state court hears the case. This is not some kind of vigilante scheme.\" The judge pressed Thompson about the idea that so-called \"bounty hunters\" can bring suit against an abortion provider without experiencing any individual injury themselves. \"What do you say about the idea of private parties acting as proxies for the state? That\\'s what the statute is designed to do. What do you do with the idea that this is putting private individuals in the shoes of the state?\" Pitman said. Later he asked: \"If the state\\'s so confident in the constitutionality of the limitations on a woman\\'s access to abortion, then why did it go to such great lengths to create this very unusual private cause of action rather than just simply doing it directly?\" The judge questioned who could technically be a defendant to face an injunction over the law if not the state itself. Thompson responded that technically nobody could be enjoined because of how the law is crafted to prevent any state official, other than judges, from being responsible for enforcement. Thompson said he disputed the characterization that the statute effectively deputizes private citizens to take on the role the state would normally take -- and said that citizens would have their own interests in bringing lawsuits against abortion providers. He also pushed back on the Justice Department\\'s contention it has standing to sue Texas based on injuries caused by the abortion law, arguing that nobody in the state has been specifically punished yet as a result and accused the federal government of seeking \"extraordinarily broad power\" by claiming the ability to usurp Texas state law. \"The United States is apparently asking the court to issue an injunction to stop the execution of a judgment that does not exist,\" Thompson said. \"It\\'s entirely speculative whether such a judgment would exist, will exist at any point, or if it existed whether it would violate the federal Constitution.\" Thompson also attempted to argue that there\\'s no \"near-total ban\" on abortion at all, and that women in the state are not unduly burdened in any way. DOJ Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Netter said during his opening argument in the hearing that there is \"no doubt under binding constitutional precedent that a state may not ban abortions at six weeks. Texas knew this, but it wanted a six week ban anyway.\" \"So the state resorted to an unprecedented scheme of vigilante justice that was designed to scare abortion providers and others who might help women exercise their constitutional rights while skirting judicial review,\" Netter said. Netter said the administration didn\\'t bring the suit \"lightly\" but that the rare step is necessary -- zeroing in on SB8\\'s enforcement mechanism as \"depriving the ability [of a woman or clinic] to redress\" a constitutional violation. Netter said this isn\\'t so much about the abortion restriction itself -- which he said is plainly unconstitutional -- but the \"mechanism\" Texas is using, which denies constitutionally protected rights. This is \"an end run around the Supremacy Clause,\" he said. \"The U.S. surely has an interest in defending and upholding the supremacy of the Constitution.\" Netter argued that Texas\\' efforts so far are \"working\" and pointed to recent reports of women seeking abortions being forced to flee the state \"under sometimes harrowing circumstances\" to get care. Arguing that Texas\\' law \"imperils the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution,\" Netter argued the DOJ was a \"proper plaintiff\" because of the Heartbeat Act\\'s \"unprecedented attack on the supremacy of the federal government and the federal Constitution.\" He noted that the law has already achieved its desired effect, referring to one provider who has already been sued for performing an abortion after the Heartbeat Act\\'s enactment. The former attorney who brought the suit, Oscar Stilley, appeared as an intervenor at Friday\\'s hearing. Stilley has said he does not oppose abortions but brought the suit to force a court review of the law. In his argument, Netter also sought to frame the potential ramifications of similarly crafted laws being allowed to take effect in other states, \"so as to create the same result -- to create unconstitutional ends through deterrence.\" Pitman asked Netter what limits there are on DOJ\\'s claims that it has the authority to challenge a state law like Texas\\', and described the DOJ\\'s theory in the case as \"pretty expansive.\" Netter responded that such a challenge would based on the law being in violation of the Constitution, having a major effect on the state\\'s citizens and, most notably, preventing citizens from having the ability to vindicate their rights -- all of which he said the Texas law does. \"What\\'s unique and what\\'s different about this law is that it specifically deprives those who are affected by the law to have an ability to obtain the redress that is necessary in order to defend the Constitution,\" Netter said. After returning from recess, Thompson from the Texas AG\\'s office asked the judge that if he rejected the state\\'s arguments that he also grant a stay pending appeal -- which would leave the abortion law in place at least until it is argued before the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Pitman then asked Thompson what actions he believes the state would have to take if he granted the government\\'s request for an emergency injunction, to which Thompson answered, \"Honestly, Your Honor, I\\'m not sure.\" Thompson said the state\\'s position remains that it has no role in enforcing the law so it\\'s not clear how it would play a role in enjoining any private citizens from taking advantage of it. Netter, in his response to Thompson\\'s argument, called it \"stunning\" that Thompson said the state took serious efforts to comply with Supreme Court precedents in enacting the abortion law. \"It doesn\\'t take a lot of reading between the lines to see what the state\\'s objectives were,\" Netter said. \"Why would the state of Texas have an interest in adopting a stated policy, a public policy that the state itself has no authority to enforce?... There\\'s no answer to the question of why they decided to structure the law this way other than because it was trying to avoid the sort of constitutional litigation that any observer could have told you would lead to a speedy injunction of a six-week abortion ban.\" Netter described Texas\\' argument that no injunction could be enforced against the law as \"aggressive and terrifying.\" \"...Such an argument is that a state can pass a law that actively violates the Constitution and deprives individuals of constitutional rights without any recourse, I think that\\'s their position,\" he said. In adjourning the hearing, Pitman said he would take all parties\\' arguments under advisement but did not give any specific timeline on when he would make his decision on the DOJ\\'s request for an emergency injunction. Any ruling is likely to face a quick appeal from either Texas or the DOJ to try and put the matter before the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which in a separate challenge previously ruled the law could take effect.

Newly released police body cam footage shows the moments before a white police officer attempted to tackle a Black woman walking her dog in a closed park, allegedly unprovoked. Nikkita Brown said that on Aug. 28 the officer drove up to her as she was walking her dog in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago and told her to leave the area immediately. She said that she was walking out of the park, adhering to his instructions, when the incident occurred. The video shows that the officer identified himself and showed his badge at Brown\\'s request. It also shows that Brown repeatedly asked the maskless officer to remain within six feet of her, citing concerns over potential exposure to COVID-19. \"Please don\\'t. Please respect my space. It\\'s COVID. Six feet,\" Brown said. \"Respect your space? I\\'m about to put handcuffs on you,\" the officer replied. Brown said she consistently told him, \"I am leaving\" and \"I am walking away,\" as she actively walked toward the exit, but he got out of his car and continued to follow her. The officer got out of his car and told her, \"You can go to jail,\" according to a video taken by Brown who recorded part of the encounter. Brown\\'s attorney identified the officer as Bruce Dyker through his badge. A Chicago Police Department spokesperson told ABC News earlier this month, \"The officer in question has been placed on desk duty as the COPA investigates the video.\" At one point during the argument with Brown -- while she had her phone out to record -- Dyker ran toward her and attempted to tackle her. The physical struggle between the two lasted for more than a minute and Dyker repeatedly threatened to arrest Brown. In the end, no arrest was made. Brown told \"Good Morning America\" earlier this month that she believes she was targeted because she\\'s Black and said she hopes that her speaking out will stop others from being targeted. \"I walked past four kids that were behind me ... white males. As soon as I saw the car pull up, I looked behind me to see if he said anything to the kids. He didn\\'t,\" Brown said. The bodycam video was released last Thursday by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA), the group investigating the incident. A COPA spokesperson told ABC News that the investigation is ongoing and once it concludes, COPA will send recommendations to the Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown to review. \"Ultimately. we want him fired, given this incident and his horrible disciplinary record,\" Brown\\'s attorney, Keenan Saulter, told ABC News. Dyker has 24 allegations of misconduct filed against him, three of which resulted in discipline.\\nThe prime minister of Georgia says former President Mikheil Saakashvili has been arrested after he had returned to the country TBILISI, Georgia -- Former President Mikheil Saakashvili was arrested after returning to Georgia, the government said Friday, a move that came as the ex-leader sought to mobilize supporters ahead of national municipal elections seen as critical to the country\\'s political makeup. The announcement by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili came hours after Saakashvili, who was convicted in absentia on abuse of power charges and has lived in Ukraine in recent years, posted on Facebook that he was back in the country. Details of the arrest were not immediately clear, but Georgian TV on Friday evening broadcast video of Saakashvili in handcuffs, with a wide smile on his face, being taken into custody by police. In earlier Facebook video, Saakashvili said he was in Batumi, the Black Sea port and resort that is Georgia\\'s second-largest city. Georgian officials earlier in the day had denied he was in the country. In the posts, Saakashvili said Saturday\\'s elections were \"crucial\" for Georgia and had called for a rally in Tbilisi on Sunday, promising to join it. Saakashvilis attempts to rally Georgians could upend the ruling partys plans to secure dominance in the balloting for mayors and local assemblies that is widely regarded as a vote of confidence in the national government and could trigger early elections next year. The European Union brokered a deal in April to ease a political crisis between the ruling Georgian Dream party and opposition groups, including Saakashvili\\'s United National Movement, the second-biggest political force in the country. The agreement stipulated that snap parliamentary elections should be called in 2022 if Georgian Dream receives less than 43% of all proportional votes in the local elections in the countrys 64 municipalities. It is unclear whether the EU deal will be followed, however. In July, Georgian Dream withdrew from the agreement because United National Movement hadnt signed onto it by then. The opposition party finally signed this month, and Saakashvili has urged supporters to turn out in force at the polls. Saakashvili\\'s intense grin in police custody underlined his penchant for public drama, particularly his bold entrances into unwelcoming places. He first gained international attention in the 2003 Rose Revolution protests when he led a crowd of demonstrators that broke into a parliament session, forcing then-President Eduard Shevardnadze to flee; Shevardnadze, a former Soviet foreign minister, resigned a day later. In 2017, he forced his way with a crowd of supporters into Ukraine from Poland, after his Ukrainian citizenship was rescinded. By going back to Georgia even though he faced certain arrest, Saakashvili also echoed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who returned to Moscow from Germany in January, was arrested on arrival and later sent to prison. Hours after his arrest on Friday, a video was posted on his Facebook page in which he and Ukrainian parliament member Yelizaveta Yasko declared they were in love and \"together.\" They said the video was recorded ahead of his departure for Georgia. Saakashvili was president in 2004-13 and was renowned for his energetic efforts against Georgias endemic corruption, but Georgians became increasingly uneasy with what they saw as his authoritarian inclinations and his sometimes-mercurial behavior. Saakashvilii left the country soon after the 2013 election, in which he could not run, was won by the candidate from Georgian Dream. In 2018, Georgian courts convicted and sentenced him to up to six years in prison. Saakashvili moved to Ukraine, where he became governor of the corruption-plagued Odesa region, and obtained Ukrainian citizenship, which nullified his Georgian citizenship. However, he fell out with then-President Petro Poroshenko, resigned his post and was stripped of Ukrainian citizenship. He forced his way back into Ukraine in 2017, but was eventually deported to Poland. After Poroshenko\\'s successor Volodymyr Zelenskyy came to power, Saakashvili returned to Ukraine and was named to a top corruption-fighting position. \"Zelenskyy is concerned by this news,\" his spokesman Serhiy Nikiforov said. \"Ukraine is appealing to Georgia for explanations of all circumstances and the reasons for this move in regards to this Ukrainian citizen.\" The Georgian prosecutor\\'s office said a case had been opened against Saakashvili for illegally crossing the border, although the basis for such a charge is unclear because Ukrainian citizens do not need visas to enter Georgia. ---= Associated Press writer Jim Heintz in Moscow contributed.\\nAs a former Division I college football player for the University of Alabama Crimson Tide, Justin Moon faced many challenges on the field. But more than a decade later, the 36-year-old step dad may have met his toughest opponent yet, when coronavirus left him fighting for his life earlier this summer just days before he was set to get his first dose of vaccine, he said. \"There\\'s only one other step beyond where I was at, and that\\'s cremation or going in your box,\" Moon, who is still hospitalized but on the road to recovery, told ABC News. \"I actually died for 4 minutes, and they paddled me and brought me back.\" Moon, of Guntersville, Alabama, was an athlete his entire life, and prior to his COVID diagnosis, he said he had no known underlying health conditions. \"I was never sick, and never missed a day of work,\" said Moon, who has spent more than 10 weeks in the hospital, including nearly six weeks on a ventilator. \"I could not do anything but blink. I could not talk, did not raise my head up off the pillow. You got to understand, being a 300-pound former athlete... man, that was tough.\" Now he and his wife, Mel, have dedicated themselves to spreading the word about vaccination and said that their efforts have helped encourage some 250 people to get their shots. \\'Never dreamt...this would be our story\\' What had first seemed to be a sinus infection in July, turned out to be much more severe than anyone could have imagined, said Moons wife, Mel. \"We never dreamt in a million years that this would be our story,\" said Mel. When his symptoms worsened, Justin was taken to the hospital, and within six days of hospitalization, he was put on a ventilator. \"At one point, the doctors told my aunt, my stepdaughter and my wife to prepare to get a call in the next 24 hours, to come up here, you know, say goodbye. It is going to happen, it\\'s just a matter of time,\" said Moon. When the vaccines became widely available, Moon said he was hesitant given the mixed messaging on vaccinations in political circles. Even though the company he works for, Waste Connections, encouraged workers to get vaccinated, he chose not to get the shot after avoiding the disease during the first wave of the pandemic. \"I was very unsure, so I stood still. And I was wrong,\" Moon said. \\'COVID doesn\\'t care\\' Across the state of Alabama, just 42% of residents have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus as of Wednesday, a reality that drove the state to a record-breaking surge over the summer. Although infection rates are beginning to abate, less than 2% of intensive care unit beds remain available across the state. The vast majority of the patients who are currently hospitalized at the University of Alabama Birmingham have not been vaccinated, according to the hospital, Brent Patterson, and those who tend to fare better and avoid severe illness are vaccinated. \"COVID doesnt care. If you are healthy, but unvaccinated, it is gonna take everyone,\" Patterson said. Just prior to his diagnosis, Moon grew concerned by the increasing number of infections in the state. After a colleague tested positive for the virus, Moon said he overcame his skepticism, and made the decision, along with his wife, Mel, to get vaccinated. His decision, ultimately, came too late, when he tested positive for the virus just days prior to when he planned to get the shot. \"If I had not been unsure of the vaccine, it would have probably gone like a lot of other stories,\" said Moon. \"Headaches, short breath, laying on the couch.\" \\'Do your homework\\' In an effort to help people truly understand the realities of COVID-19, the Moon family decided to share their story in their community. \"We don\\'t want anyone to ever have to go through what we\\'ve gone through. And that\\'s the lesson we learned: don\\'t stand still, do your homework. Don\\'t listen to the wrong forces, talk to your physician, and your family,\" Mel said. \"There cant be anything about being vaccinated that is as bad as this.\" So far, Moons wife, who is working to get the word out along with his employer, says his story has convinced at least 250 unvaccinated people within the community to get the shot. Moon\\'s family have been collecting texts and emails from people, who have reached out to let them know that they have got vaccinated after hearing Justin\\'s story. As of this week, they said they have heard from at least 250 newly vaccinated people. \"They hear the entire story of what\\'s going on with me, and, if they were in doubt, or we\\'re just in the same situation that I was, they see me, and see that I very, very seldom got sick or had any issues... if we could affect Justin like this... it can be much, much worse,\" Justin Moon said. Moon still has a long road ahead of him, undergoing grueling rehabilitation, as he works to regain his strength and his sense of feeling in his dominant right arm, which is still completely numb. He is also learning how to stand up and walk again, and he still needs oxygen after walking a few feet. \"Not too many people get a second chance at life,\" said Moon. \"But it didn\\'t have to be like that. The story could have gone very different.\"\\nHis move comes as Democrats are at an impasse over passing his agenda. President Joe Biden went to Capitol Hill Friday afternoon to meet with House Democrats, White House officials said, amid party infighting that has put his legislative agenda in jeopardy. Biden, who has kept a low public profile most of the week while negotiating behind the scenes trying to break the impasse, spoke behind doors with liberal and moderate lawmakers for about half an hour. As he emerged, he told reporters, \"Im telling you, were gonna get this done.\" He added, \"It doesnt matter when. It doesnt matter whether its in six minutes, six days, or six weeks. Were gonna get it done.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has twice had to delay a vote on a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan Biden supports because progressive Democrats are vowing to defeat it unless they also get a vote on $3.5 trillion social safety net and climate policy measure he also supports -- but one that two moderate Democratic senators have objected to as too costly. Beforehand, some Democrats said they were excited to be hearing from Biden directly and some had complained in recent days that he was not more involved in negotiations. \"He\\'s going over there to make the case for his legislative agenda, which includes the infrastructure bill, and it includes his Build Back Better agenda that would be in the reconciliation package, so he wants to speak directly to members, answer their questions and make the case for why we should all work together to give the American people more breathing room,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters shortly before Biden was scheduled to leave for the Capitol. Asked whether he expected to walk out of there with an agreement, Pskai said, \"Im not going to make a prediction of whether there will or won\\'t be a vote. I\\'ll leave that to Speaker Pelosi to determine when she will call a vote. But he\\'s making the case he believes its -- it\\'s the right time for him to go up there.\" \"The case that the White House is making is that compromise requires everybody giving little. That\\'s the stage we\\'re in. But no matter where we end, if we can get something done here, we\\'re going to have a historic piece of legislation passed Congress that\\'s going to have a huge impact on the American people,\" she added.\\nThe first big Womens March of the Biden administration reached the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court WASHINGTON -- The first Women\\'s March of the Biden administration headed straight for the steps of the Supreme Court on Saturday, part of nationwide protests that drew thousands to Washington to demand continued access to abortion in a year when conservative lawmakers and judges have put it in jeopardy. Demonstrators filled the streets surrounding the court, shouting \"My body, my choice\" and cheering loudly to the beat of drums. Before heading out on the march, they rallied in a square near the White House, waving signs that said \"Mind your own uterus,\" \"I love someone who had an abortion\" and \"Abortion is a personal choice, not a legal debate,\" among other messages. Some wore T-shirts reading simply \"1973,\" a reference to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which made abortion legal for generations of American women. Elaine Baijal, a 19-year-old student at American University, said her mother told her of coming to a march for legal abortion with her own mother in the 1970s. \"Its sad that we still have to fight for our right 40 years later. But its a tradition I want to continue,\" Baijal said of the march. Organizers say the Washington march was among hundreds of abortion-themed protests held around the country Saturday. The demonstrations took place two days before the start of a new term for the Supreme Court that will decide the future of abortion rights in the United States, after appointments of justices by President Donald Trump strengthened conservative control of the high court. \"Shame, shame, shame!\" marchers chanted while walking past the Trump International Hotel on their way to the Supreme Court. Some booed and waved their fists at the Trump landmark. The day before the march, the Biden administration urged a federal judge to block the nations most restrictive abortion law, which has banned most abortions in Texas since early September. It\\'s one of a series of cases that will give the nation\\'s divided high court occasion to uphold or overrule Roe v. Wade. The Texas law motivated many of the demonstrators and speakers. \"Were going to keep giving it to Texas,\" Marsha Jones of the Afiya Center for Black womens health care in Dallas, pledged to the Washington crowd. \"You can no longer tell us what to do with our bodies!\" Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood nationally, told of women forced to drive many hours across state lines -- sometimes multiple state lines -- to end pregnancies in the weeks since the Texas law went into effect. \"The moment is dark ... but that is why we are here,\" Johnson told the crowd packed into Freedom Square and surrounding streets. With the upcoming Supreme Court term, \"No matter where you are, this fight is at your doorstep right now.\" In Springfield, Illinois, several hundred people rallied on the Old State Capitol square. Prominent among them were the Illinois Handmaids, wearing red robes and white bonnets reminiscent of the subjugated women of Margaret Atwoods novel \"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\" and carrying signs that said, \"Mind Your Own Uterus\" and \"Mother By Choice.\" Brigid Leahy, senior director of public policy for Planned Parenthood of Illinois, said just two days after the Texas restrictions took effect, Planned Parenthood saw the first women from Texas traveling to Illinois for the procedure, with more following since. \"They are trying to figure out paying for airfare or gas or a train ticket, they may need hotel and meals,\" Leahy said. \"They have to figure out time off of work, and they have to figure out child care. This can be a real struggle.\" With a sign reading \"Not this again\" attached to a clothes hanger, Gretchen Snow of Bloomington, Illinois, said, \"Women need to be safe and they need to not have to worry about how much money they have to be safe.\" On the West Coast, thousands marched through downtown Los Angeles to a rally in front of City Hall. Protesters chanted \"Abortion on demand and without apology: only revolution can make women free!\" Kayla Selsi said she was carrying the same sign she has held in three past Womens Marches. It stated, \"If only my vagina could shoot bullets, it will be less regulated.\" \"Unfortunately, I cant retire this sign,\" Selsi said. \"Womens rights are being taken away, and its highly affecting women of lower class.\" \"I feel safer in California as a woman, but Texas is obviously going in one direction and it scares me that other states could go the same way,\" she said. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul spoke at rallies in Seneca Falls and then Albany. \"I\\'m sick and tired of having to fight over abortion rights,\" she said. \"It\\'s settled law in the nation and you are not taking that right away from us, not now not ever.\" Addressing demonstrators at the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix, Democratic state Rep. Melody Hernandez said abortion foes emboldened by the recent developments in Texas and at the Supreme Court would not prevail. \"An overwhelming majority of Arizonans, of Americans, support everything we are standing here for today,\" Hernandez said. \"And dont let anyone fool you -- we are the majority. We are made ... of people from all walks of life, ethnicity, party, nationality.\" At an unrelated event in Maine, Republican Sen. Susan Collins called the Texas law \"extreme, inhumane and unconstitutional\" and said shes working to make Roe v. Wade the \"law of the land.\" She said shes working with two Democrats and another Republican, and theyre \"vetting\" the language of their bill. Collins declined to identify her colleagues, but said the legislation will be introduced soon. An opponent of women\\'s access to abortion called this year\\'s march theme \"macabre.\" \"What about equal rights for unborn women?\" tweeted Jeanne Mancini, president of an anti-abortion group called March for Life. The Women\\'s March has become a regular event -- although interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic -- since millions of women turned out in the United States and around the world the day after the January 2017 inauguration of Trump. Trump endorsed punishing women for getting abortions and made appointment of conservative judges a mission of his presidency. With the sun beating down in Washington on Saturday, Ramsay Teviotdale of Arlington, Virginia -- who when asked her age said she was \"old enough to remember when abortion wasnt legal\" -- was one of the few wearing the hand-knitted pink wool caps that distinguished the 2017 Womens March. Without Trump as a central figure for women of varied political beliefs to rally against, and with the pandemic still going strong, organizers talked of hundreds of thousands of participants nationally Saturday, not the millions of 2017. Teviotdale said this does not lessen the urgency of the moment. \"This Texas thing -- no way can it stand. Its the thin edge of the wedge,\" she said. Security in the capital was much lighter than for a political rally a few weeks ago in support of Trump supporters jailed in the Jan. 6 insurrection. No fence was placed around the U.S. Capitol, with the Capitol Police chief saying there was nothing to suggest Saturday\\'s rally would be violent. ------ Associated Press writers John O\\'Connor in Springfield, Illinois; David Sharp in Bath, Maine; and Daisy Nguyen in San Francisco contributed to this report. .\\nOregon congressional candidate and hero soldier Alek Skarlatos formed a nonprofit to advocate for veterans after he lost his 2020 race WASHINGTON -- Alek Skarlatos, a hero soldier-turned-Republican congressional candidate, started a nonprofit shortly after his 2020 defeat in a western Oregon race, pledging to advocate for veterans \"left high and dry\" by the country \"they put their lives on the line for.\" The group, which Skarlatos seeded with $93,000 in leftover campaign funds, has done little since then to advance that cause. What it has nurtured, though, are Skarlatos\\' political ambitions, providing $65,000, records show, to his 2022 bid for a rematch with longtime Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio in a district stretching from the college town of Corvallis to the Oregon shore. It\\'s a seat that Republicans are targeting in their quest to win back the House. Campaign finance laws prohibit candidates from self-dealing and from accepting illicit money from often opaque and less regulated world of political nonprofits. That includes a prohibition on candidates donating campaign cash to nonprofit groups they control, as well as a broader ban on accepting contributions from such groups, legal experts say. But years of lax campaign finance law enforcement have fostered an environment where many candidates are willing to challenge the long-established boundaries of what\\'s legal. \"You cant do that,\" said Adav Noti, a former lawyer for the Federal Election Commission who now works for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington. \"Theres serious corruption potential. The law contemplates that.\" Skarlatos\\' campaign did not make him available for an interview, did not address the activities of the nonprofit and would not say whether Skarlatos currently holds a role with the group. Campaign manager Ross Purgason said the transactions were \"completely legal.\" \"Despite an attempt to smear Alek Skarlatos, who served in Afghanistan, he was never paid a dollar,\" said Purgason. In 2015, Skarlotos, a member of the Oregon National Guard, gained a measure of fame when he helped disrupt an attack on a train bound for Paris by a heavily armed man who was a follower of the Islamic State group. Hailed as a hero, he appeared on \"Dancing with the Stars,\" visited the White House and was granted dual French citizenship. It also led to a role starring as himself in the Clint Eastwood movie \"15:17 to Paris.\" Once he turned to politics, his biography served as a cornerstone of his campaign against DeFazio, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, who went on to beat Skarlatos by 5 percentage points in November 2020. Skarlatos started the nonprofit the month after his loss, naming it 15:17 Trust -- a reference to the train attack. It was registered in Virginia, with his campaign treasurer also serving as the group\\'s treasurer, records show. \"Our service men and women are special people -- heroes -- who have and will put their lives on the line for ours, and we owe it to them to make sure theyre taken care of,\" Skarlatos said in a March 2021 fundraising email. \"This is why I am proud to announce that I am officially launching the 15:17 Trust, a new 501(c) 4 non-profit organization dedicated to advocating on behalf of and supporting our veterans.\" But the group has had a decidedly low profile. It has an active online fundraising page, but its website is offline. A Facebook page is \"liked\" by only nine people. Its Twitter account has zero followers and only one tweet from April, soliciting input for a survey on veterans\\' concerns. A search of media databases shows no instance of the group being mentioned in news stories. Federal candidates and officeholders are allowed to donate campaign funds to nonprofit groups. But they are prohibited from donating to nonprofits that they operate. Skarlatos\\' campaign account gave $93,000 in February to his 15:17 Fund. The law is intended to prevent candidates from sidestepping a prohibition on the personal use of campaign funds by routing money to a separate group that they could then use to collect a salary or payments. Separately, federal campaigns face tight limits on how much and who can give to them. That includes a ban on accepting donations from corporations, including nonprofits, which can accept unlimited sums from anonymous donors. Though the transfer of $65,000 from Skarlatos\\' nonprofit to his campaign was listed as a \"refund\" in filings, that likely doesn\\'t square with the law, said Noti, the former FEC attorney. \"You cant, months later, send a different amount from a nonprofit company to a campaign and say it was a refund for a larger amount that was transferred much earlier,\" he said. Skarlatos has collected payments from his campaign in the past. During the 2020 campaign, Skarlatos paid himself more than $43,000 in mileage reimbursements, rent and expenses vaguely listed as \"contractor campaign staff,\" records show. In the two months after launching his 2022 GOP primary bid -- the only period of time reflected yet in quarterly filings submitted so far -- he has collected another $2,521 in mileage reimbursements. The payments Skarlatos\\' collected from his campaign were made at a time when he had an inconsistent stream of personal income, according to his congressional financial disclosures. He reported making $40,000 from speaking fees, endorsements and residuals from his movie work in 2018. But in 2020 that income dropped to $20,000. His most recent disclosure, which was filed this past week, shows he has earned at least $78,000 this year. But it did not reveal any income from his nonprofit and did not indicate whether he holds a role with the group. Who works for the nonprofit, as well as who has earned income from it, will become clearer next year when the group files publicly available tax paperwork.\\nKierra Coles was last seen on Oct. 2, 2018. She was about three months pregnant. Three years ago, a 26-year-old postal worker who was eagerly expecting her first child mysteriously disappeared in her own neighborhood. There\\'s still no resolution, leaving her heartbroken mother desperate to know if her daughter is even alive or dead. Kierra Coles was about three months pregnant when she vanished on Oct. 2, 2018, on Chicago\\'s South Side. Her car was found in front of her apartment with her phone and packed lunch still inside. The Chicago Police Department considers the case \"a high-risk missing person investigation with potential foul play suspected.\" For Coles\\' mother, Karen Phillips, having no answers is torturous. Phillips said police have not provided any information whenever she\\'s called over the last year. \"I could never reach nobody. They\\'re gone to lunch, they\\'ll call me back, they\\'re out of the office. It\\'s always something,\" she told ABC News last week. \"They don\\'t even reach out and say, \\'Well, Ms. Phillips, we\\'re still going through this\\' ... or, \\'We don\\'t have any new leads.\\' Just say something.\" The Chicago police didn\\'t respond to Phillips\\' claim that they ignored her calls, but in a statement to ABC News the police department said it urges \"anybody with knowledge of her last whereabouts ... to contact the Chicago Police Department.\" \"We are seeking any and all information in an attempt to locate her and we won\\'t stop until we do,\" police said. For Phillips, the loss is \"unbearable.\" \"I went from seeing my child every day -- if not seeing her, at least talking to her every day -- to not seeing her in three years,\" Phillips said. \"I try to stay strong for the other kids, I try to not really break down in front of them. But we talk about her all the time, we got pictures everywhere. We just really want her home.\" Coles\\' siblings range in age from 35 to 24. Coles, a devoted aunt to her nieces and nephews, was the last of Phillips\\' children to have a baby. Phillips said she misses the grandchild she never got a chance to meet. \"I miss him -- he or she -- even though they wasn\\'t born yet. I just miss him because she would\\'ve been a great mother,\" she said. \"For her to be a mother, we were so excited. ... That was the last thing she was waiting for.\" Coles had a plan for her life and so far \"everything was going according to plan,\" her mother said. Coles first wanted a good job, and after years with the post office she had saved for a car and a home. Then, she and her boyfriend decided they were ready for a baby, Phillips said. For her to vanish \"out of the blue,\" she said, \"I can\\'t understand it.\" The United States Postal Inspection Service and the FBI are both working with the Chicago police on the case. \"Since October 2018, Postal Inspectors have tracked down and vetted nearly 400 leads across the country. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service distributed thousands of reward flyers,\" the Postal Inspection Service said. \"Kierra Coles is a member of our Postal family and we will continue looking for her and following up on all leads,\" the agency continued. \"If you know something, no matter how trivial it may seem, please come forward as it may be crucial to our investigation. Please contact the U.S. Postal Inspection Service hotline at (877) 876-2455 and reference case number 2693502.\" Some days Phillips said she \"really can\\'t function because my mind just, you know, keeps wondering -- where\\'s my child? Is she being harmed? Is she dead or alive?\" \"It\\'s hard waking up every day wondering,\" she said. \"I just want somebody to come forward and say what happened.\"\\nAfter multiple delays to a House vote on his infrastructure deal this week, President Joe Biden says he still believes his party can overcome disagreements to move the plan forward. Speaking with reporters Saturday, Biden pledged to \"work like hell\" to get both the bipartisan and reconciliation infrastructure bills passed as his ambitious domestic agenda hangs in the balance. \"Everybody is frustrated. Its part of being in government -- being frustrated,\" Biden said, when asked for his message to moderates in the House who wanted to see a vote move forward on the bipartisan bill that would fund traditional infrastructure. During a frantic week of negotiations, Democratic leaders struggled to strike a deal after progressive Democrats threatened to tank the vote on the package unless the party agreed on Bidens reconciliation bill that focuses on social spending and climate and which Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz,. have said they would not support due to its $3.5 trillion price tag. In a statement Saturday afternoon, Sinema slammed Democratic leadership in the House for delaying its vote on the bipartisan Infrastructure deal, saying the failure to do so is \"inexcusable, and deeply disappointing for communities across our country.\" \"There is no reason why both these bills couldn\\'t pass independently except that there\\'s not the votes to do it that way,\" Biden said. Asked if he was surprised by how difficult it\\'s been to get moderate and progressive Democrats to bridge their divides, Biden pointed to the 50-50 split in the Senate that his party must contend with. \"We can bring the moderates and progressives together very easy if we had two more votes. Two. Two people,\" Biden said, appearing to take aim at Manchin and Sinema. Bidens comments came as he departed the White House for Wilmington, Delaware, Saturday morning, where White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the president will continue to work on negotiations. \"The President and his team will continue close engagement with Members of both the House and the Senate through the weekend. And he looks forward to not only welcoming Members to the White House next week, but also traveling the country to make the case for his bold and ambitious agenda,\" Psaki said in a statement. \"I\\'m going to try and sell what I think the American people will buy,\" Biden told reporters Saturday morning. \"There\\'s nothing in any of these pieces of legislation that\\'s radical, that is unreasonable that is--when you look at it, individually.\" Friday afternoon, Biden took a trip to Capitol Hill to make the case for his economic agenda directly to House Democrats amid the precarious stand-off. Behind closed doors, Biden suggested that a smaller price tag for his social policy bill -- ranging from $1.9 to $2.2 trillion -- could help legislators come to a compromise, according to sources in the room for the meeting. That, along with the $1.2 trillion traditional infrastructure bill, would still be a huge investment, he is said to have told the caucus, acknowledging both bills need to be agreed upon to move forward. In a letter to Democratic lawmakers Saturday afternoon, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the bipartisan infrastructure bill would need to be passed \"well before\" Halloween, when the 30-day extension of federal highway and transit funding approved by the House on Friday is set to expire. \"We will and must pass both bills soon. We have the responsibility and the opportunity to do so. People are waiting and want results,\" Pelosi wrote. The president would not outline a timeline for passing the bills when pressed Saturday morning, and he bristled at questions about his confidence while making it clear he remained optimistic that he would get to sign both pieces of legislation. \"I believe I can get this done. I believe once the American people are aware what\\'s in it, we\\'ll get it done,\" he said.

Baird\\'s resignation was announced by the league late Friday, a day after The Athletic published the accounts of two former players who claimed misconduct, including sexual coercion, by North Carolina coach Paul Riley. Riley was fired by the Courage on Thursday and the allegations touched off a wave of condemnation by players that forced this weekend\\'s games to be called off. Additionally, FIFA on Friday opened an investigation into the case. It is rare that soccer\\'s international governing body gets involved in a controversy involving a member association. U.S. Soccer also announced an independent investigation on Friday. U.S. Soccer was instrumental in founding the NWSL in 2013 and helped support the league until last year, when it became independent. The federation continues its financial support of the league. \"Player safety and respect is the paramount responsibility of every person involved in this game. That is true across every age, competition and ability level,\" U.S. Soccer President Cindy Cone said in a statement. \"We owe it to each athlete, each fan and the entire soccer community to take every meaningful action in our power to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.\" U.S. Soccer suspended Rileys coaching license Thursday after The Athletic published claims of abuse made by former NWSL players Sinead Farrelly and Mana Shim. FIFA told The Associated Press it was \"deeply concerned\" by the case and will now be seeking further details from American soccer authorities about the issues raised. \"Due to the severity and seriousness of the allegations being made by players, we can confirm that FIFAs judicial bodies are actively looking into the matter and have opened a preliminary investigation,\" FIFA said in a statement to the AP. \"As part of this, FIFA will be reaching out to the respective parties, including US Soccer and NWSL, for further information about the various safeguarding concerns and allegations of abuse that have been raised.\" The alleged harassment of Farrelly started in 2011 when she was a player with the Philadelphia Independence of the now-defunct Womens Professional Soccer league. She told the website the harassment continued when Farrelly was with the Portland Thorns. Shim, a former Thorns player, also allegedly experienced harassment. The Thorns said Thursday that the team investigated claims about Riley and passed those on to the league when he was dismissed. Riley told The Athletic the allegations were \"completely untrue.\" Outcry over the allegations rocked the league and forced this weekends games to be called off. The NWSL Players\\' Association said it hoped fans would understand and support the decision. \"It is OK to take space to process, to feel and to take care of yourself,\" the union said. \"In fact, its more than OK, its a priority. That, as players, will be our focus this weekend.\" Baird became commissioner of the NWSL in February, 2020, after serving as chief marketing officer of the United States Olympic Committee. She was praised for brining new sponsors to the NWSL and increasing the league\\'s visibility on the national stage. OL Reign midfielder Jess Fishlock, who has been playing in the NWSL since its inception in 2013, suggested the league, and womens sports overall, are in the midst of a reckoning. \"I think women athletes specifically have gone through so much over the years, not just womens football,\" Fishlock said. \"I think everybody knows whats happened with USA Gymnastics that has gone on, and this is something that has been happening in womens sports over and over and over again for years and years and years. And weve never felt safe enough to talk about it, and if we ever felt brave enough to talk about it, then it would just get swept under the rug, or we were told that we were in the wrong ... and I think were at a point now where were just done.\" Riley was head coach of the Thorns in 2014 and 2015. After he was let go by the Thorns, he became head coach of the Western New York Flash for a season before the team was sold and moved to North Carolina. In its ninth season, the NWSL has been rocked by a series of recent scandals involving team officials. Washington Spirit coach Richie Burke was fired after a Washington Post report detailed verbal and emotional abuse of players. The league formally dismissed Burke and sanctioned the Spirit on Tuesday after an independent investigation. Gotham FC general manager Alyse LaHue was fired in July after an investigation connected to the leagues antiharassment policy. She has denied any wrongdoing. Racing Louisville coach Christy Holly was fired in September but the reasons for his dismissal were not made public. OL Reign coach Farid Benstiti abruptly resigned in July. On Friday, OL Reign chief executive officer and minority owner Bill Predmore said Benstiti was asked to step down after an undisclosed incident during practice. Benstiti had previously been accused by U.S. national team midfielder Lindsay Horan of sexist behavior during his time as coach of Paris Saint-Germain. Horan has said she was berated by Benstiti because of her weight. ------ AP Sports Writer Eddie Pells contributed to this report. ------ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports\\nAfter being vaulted into the New York governors office two months ago, Democrat Kathy Hochul is preparing to run for the job in her own right next year NEW YORK -- After being vaulted into office two months ago, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is preparing to run for the job in her own right next year. But as she works to sculpt her reputation in the wake of Andrew Cuomos resignation, a cohort of fellow Democrats is making moves to potentially challenge her in the primary. At least half a dozen Democrats could set up the 2022 race with a historically diverse field of top contenders, including Attorney General Letitia James, the state\\'s first Black attorney general. James, who oversaw the sexual harassment investigation that prompted Cuomos resignation, has not said whether shell run, but she sounded like a candidate Wednesday as she addressed an influential civic group in New York City. In a campaign-style speech, she rebuked Cuomo, called for reforms to a state ethics commission and issued a call to begin a new era in government and \"to make history, to break ground, to shatter societys self-imposed glass ceilings.\" She dodged a question about whether shes running: \"I am focusing on my work, putting my head down and serving all of you as the attorney general.\" At a dinner Thursday night, James told another group of Democrats, \"Stay tuned.\" \"I love serving as the attorney general of the great state of New York,\" she said, according to a recording of her remarks obtained by the New York Post. \"But the question, again, is: Can I make more change?\" New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams announced this week hes formed a committee to explore a run for governor, an office he could become only the second Black man to hold. And New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is term limited, hinted this week that he is also considering a gubernatorial campaign. De Blasio, Williams, James and Hochul all attended a Brooklyn Democratic Party breakfast fundraiser Thursday. \"We havent had a wide open, Democratic primary for governor like this in a long, long time,\" said Neal Kwatra, a Democratic strategist who worked on Cuomos 2014 campaign and once served as chief of staff to former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. \"This is an authentically open primary, which I think makes it irresistible,\" he said. Of all the potential challengers, James \"is unquestionably the most formidable,\" Kwatra said, citing big battles she took on as attorney general and her strong base of support in New York City. In less than three years, James has used her office to take on powerful targets beyond Cuomo, suing opioid manufacturers and the National Rifle Association and investigating former President Donald Trumps business affairs. Hochul, a 63-year-old centrist and former member of Congress from the Buffalo area, is meanwhile working to quickly seize a political spotlight that Cuomo once dominated. \"Most New Yorkers didnt know who the heck she was until about a month ago,\" said Patrick J. Egan, an associate professor of politics at New York University. \"So she not only has to get her name out there, she also has to establish her record and give people the sense that shes somebody that they want to lead the state.\" To do that, shes been giving cable news interviews and making frequent appearances in the heavily populated, heavily Democratic New York City area, seen as critical in a statewide primary. If several city politicians challenge her and split the downstate vote -- James, Williams and de Blasio all call Brooklyn home -- Hochul\\'s connections to upstate and western New York could be a decisive advantage, Egan said. During a news conference Thursday, Hochul said shes not preoccupied with potential challengers. \"I dont have to have the time to be distracted by the political noise,\" she said. \"Everybody is free to do what they want. Ive got a job to do and that is my focus.\" She has pledged a fresh break from the decadelong Cuomo era, which ended amid sexual harassment allegations and the revelation that his administration released misleading statistics on COVID-19 deaths. Cuomo\\'s spokespeople have argued that the investigation into his conduct that James oversaw was biased against him because of her political ambitions -- a charge that James has dismissed as unfounded. Williams, a 45-year-old former city councilman, said if he runs, hed present a break from the \"toxicity and \"egos\" seen in Albany, New Yorks capital. \"What I would like to bring is a different way of doing politics,\" he said in interview this week on NY1, a cable news station. Williams, a regular presence at street demonstrations on racial injustice for years, is perhaps the most progressive potential contender to emerge so far. Hochul has already beaten him once before, when the two faced off in a race for lieutenant governor in 2018. De Blasio, who launched a short-lived presidential campaign in 2019, has struggled with skewering tabloid headlines during his time running the nation\\'s largest city. His twilight months as mayor, intended as a full-throated celebration of the city\\'s resurgence following the pandemic, have been marred by the coronavirus\\' refusal to go away and a crisis at the city\\'s Rikers Island jail, which has struggled with staffing shortages and prisoner deaths. De Blasio said this week that he wants to keep serving the city and the state after his term ends in December. \"I want to continue working on issues that I care about deeply,\" he said at a news conference this week. \"So, you know, Im going to figure out the best way I can serve going forward.\" Other potential candidates include Steve Bellone, the Suffolk County executive overseeing eastern Long Island. He has been traveling around the state and has hired political strategists as he weighs a campaign. U.S. Rep. Thomas Suozzi, who represents Long Island and Queens and whose name has been in the mix as a candidate, demurred when asked by The Washington Post last week when he would make a decision about whether to run for governor. Though New York is a blue state where more than half of registered voters are Democrats and a Republican hasnt held the governors mansion in 15 years, several Republicans are planning to make their case to voters next year. The GOP candidates include: Lee Zeldin, a Trump-aligned congressman from Long Island; Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani; and former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, who lost to Cuomo in 2014. ------ Associated Press writer Michael R. Sisak contributed to this report.\\nTwo salmon species have all but disappeared from Alaska\\'s Yukon River this year, prompting the state to shut down fishing in an effort to save them STEVENS VILLAGE, Alaska -- In a normal year, the smokehouses and drying racks that Alaska Natives use to prepare salmon to tide them through the winter would be heavy with fish meat, the fruits of a summer spent fishing on the Yukon River like generations before them. This year, there are no fish. For the first time in memory, both king and chum salmon have dwindled to almost nothing and the state has banned salmon fishing on the Yukon, even the subsistence harvests that Alaska Natives rely on to fill their freezers and pantries for winter. The remote communities that dot the river and live off its bounty -- far from road systems and easy, affordable shopping -- are desperate and doubling down on moose and caribou hunts in the waning days of fall. \"Nobody has fish in their freezer right now. Nobody,\" said Giovanna Stevens, 38, a member of the Stevens Village tribe who grew up harvesting salmon at her family\\'s fish camp. \"We have to fill that void quickly before winter gets here.\" Opinions on what led to the catastrophe vary, but those studying it generally agree human-caused climate change is playing a role as the river and the Bering Sea warm, altering the food chain in ways that aren\\'t yet fully understood. Many believe commercial trawling operations that scoop up wild salmon along with their intended catch, as well as competition from hatchery-raised salmon in the ocean, have compounded global warming\\'s effects on one of North America\\'s longest rivers. The assumption that salmon that aren\\'t fished make it back to their native river to lay eggs may no longer hold up because of changes in both the ocean and river environments, said Stephanie Quinn-Davidson, who has worked on Yukon River salmon issues for a decade and is the Alaska Venture Fund\\'s program director for fisheries and communities. King, or chinook, salmon have been in decline for more than a decade, but chum salmon were more plentiful until last year. This year, summer chum numbers plummeted and numbers of fall chum -- which travel farther upriver -- are dangerously low. \"Everyone wants to know, \\'What is the one smoking gun? What is the one thing we can point to and stop?\" she said of the collapse. \"People are reluctant to point to climate change because there isnt a clear solution ... but its probably the biggest factor here.\" Many Alaska Native communities are outraged they are paying the price for generations of practices beyond their control that have caused climate change -- and many feel state and federal authorities aren\\'t doing enough to bring Indigenous voices to the table. The scarcity has made raw strong emotions about who should have the right to fish in a state that supplies the world with salmon, and underscores the powerlessness many Alaska Natives feel as traditional resources dwindle. The nearly 2,000-mile-long (3,200-kilometer) Yukon River starts in British Columbia and drains an area larger than Texas in both Canada and Alaska as it cuts through the lands of Athabascan, Yupik and other tribes. The crisis is affecting both subsistence fishing in far-flung outposts and fish processing operations that employ tribal members in communities along the lower Yukon and its tributaries. \"In the tribal villages, our people are livid. Theyre extremely angry that we are getting penalized for what others are doing,\" said P.J. Simon, chairman and chief of the Tanana Chiefs Conference, a consortium of 42 tribal villages in the Alaska interior. \"As Alaska Natives, we have a right to this resource. We have a right to have a say in how things are drawn up and divvied up.\" More than a half-dozen Alaska Native groups have petitioned for federal aid, and they want the state\\'s federal delegation to hold a hearing in Alaska on the salmon crisis. The groups also seek federal funding for more collaborative research on effects that ocean changes are having on returning salmon. Citing the warming ocean, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy requested a federal disaster declaration for the salmon fishery this month and has helped coordinate airlifts of about 90,000 pounds (41,000 kilograms) of fish to needy villages. The salmon crisis is one of the governor\\'s top priorities, said Rex Rock Jr., Dunleavys advisor for rural affairs and Alaska Native economic development. That\\'s done little to appease remote villages that are dependent on salmon to get through winter, when snow paralyzes the landscape and temperatures can dip to minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 29 C) or lower. Families traditionally spend the summer at fish camps using nets and fish wheels to snag adult salmon as they migrate inland from the ocean to the place where they hatched so they can spawn. The salmon is prepared for storage a variety of ways: dried for jerky, cut into fillets that are frozen, canned in half-pint jars or preserved in wooden barrels with salt. Without those options, communities are under intense pressure to find other protein sources. In the Alaska interior, the nearest road system is often dozens of miles away, and it can take hours by boat, snow machine or even airplane to reach a grocery store. Store-bought food is prohibitively expensive for many: A gallon (3.8 liters) of milk can cost nearly $10, and a pound of steak was recently $34 in Kaltag, an interior village about 328 air miles (528 kilometers) from Fairbanks. A surge in COVID-19 cases that has disproportionately hit Alaska Natives has also made many hesitant to venture far from home. Instead, villages sent out extra hunting parties during the fall moose season and are looking to the upcoming caribou season to meet their needs. Those who can\\'t hunt themselves rely on others to share their meat. \"We have to watch our people because there will be some who will have no food about midyear,\" said Christina Semaken, a 63-year-old grandmother who lives in Kaltag, an Alaska interior town of fewer than 100 people. \"We cant afford to buy that beef or chicken.\" Semaken hopes to fish next year, but whether the salmon will come back remains unknown. Tribal advocates want more genetic testing on salmon harvested from fishing grounds in Alaska waters to make sure that commercial fisheries aren\\'t intercepting wild Yukon River salmon. They also want more fish-tracking sonar on the river to ensure an accurate count of the salmon that escape harvest and make it back to the river\\'s Canadian headwaters. Yet changes in the ocean itself might ultimately determine the salmon\\'s fate. The Bering Sea, where the river meets the ocean, had unprecedented ice loss in recent years, and its water temperatures are rising. Those shifts are throwing off the timing of the plankton bloom and the distribution of small invertebrates that the fish eat, creating potential chaos in the food chain thats still being studied, said Kate Howard, a fisheries scientist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Researchers have also documented warming temperatures in the river that are unhealthy for salmon, she said. Because salmon spend time in both rivers and the ocean during their unique life cycle, it\\'s hard to pin down exactly where these rapid environmental changes are most affecting them -- but it\\'s increasingly clear that overfishing is not the only culprit, Howard said. \"When you dig into all the available data for Yukon River salmon,\" she said, \"its hard to explain it all unless you consider climate change.\" Alaska Natives, meanwhile, are left scrambling to fill a hole in their diet -- and in centuries of tradition built around salmon. On a recent fall day, a small hunting party zoomed along the Yukon River by motorboat, scanning the shoreline for signs of moose. After three days, the group had killed two moose, enough to provide meat for seven families, or about 50 people, for roughly a month in their small community of Stevens Village. At the end of a long day, they butchered the animals as the Northern Lights blazed a vibrant green across the sky, their headlamps piercing the inky darkness. The makeshift camp, miles from any road, would normally host several dozen families harvesting salmon, sharing meals and teaching children how to fish. On this day, it was eerily quiet. \"I dont really think that there is any kind of bell out there that you can ring loud enough to try to explain that type of connection,\" said Ben Stevens, whose ancestors founded Stevens Village. \"Salmon, to us, is life. Where can you go beyond that?\"\\nFront-line workers at a Missouri hospital are being provided with personal panic buttons after the number of assaults against employees has recently tripled, officials said. Between 300 and 400 staff working in the emergency department and inpatient hospital rooms at Cox Medical Center in Branson will wear the buttons on their badges, the hospital said. If they are in distress, they can push the button, which alerts security on hospital computers showing the employee\\'s exact location. The distress calls will also be displayed in the hospital\\'s nurse call system. The safety button system is set to be implemented by the end of the year and comes amid a \"spike\" in assaults against employees, the hospital said. Between 2019 and 2020, Cox Medical Center has seen its total violent events increase from 94 to 162, total assaults increase from 40 to 123, total injuries jump from 17 to 78, and assaults leading to injury tick up from 42.5% to 63%, according to hospital data. Most of the assaults come from patients, according to the hospital, but staff have also seen several visitors become violent. Not all incidents are reported to the police, as staff sometimes may feel like it\\'s just part of the job, hospital officials said. \"A lot of workplace violence events are underreported as staff don\\'t feel like they would be able to do anything about it,\" Angie Smith, Cox Branson Patient Safety facilitator, said in a statement. A new law that went into effect in Missouri in August makes it a Class D misdemeanor to threaten health care workers. Cox Medical Center staff said they were grateful for the added security measure. \"We\\'ve had a large number of violence cases that have been reported in the emergency department that\\'s been going on over the last three or four, three to five years,\" nurse Kimber Unruh told ABC News in a video diary. \"Staff have complained of being spit [on], grabbed, held -- a variety of other things. So we\\'re very thankful to have this as an option to help keep our staff safe.\" Normally employees carry a radio, which they can use to radio staff who can then contact security, but the panic button \"gets security to us faster when staff feels threatened or unsafe in this environment,\" nurse Whitley Gott told ABC News in a video diary. Health care workers are common targets of assault while on the job, accounting for three-quarters of all workplace assaults, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Although the recent uptick at Cox Medical Center has not been directly correlated to COVID-19, hospital officials said they realize that frustrations are generally quite high right now. The American Hospital Association told ABC News that nationally it has heard of \"anecdotal reports of increased mistreatment, harassment and violence directed at health care workers in hospital and health system settings.\" According to the Missouri Hospital Association, other hospitals are using similar tools. Every hospital must conduct a threat assessment to define the best strategies to protect patients and staff. Others include surveillance video and body cameras. The safety button system at Cox Medical Center is being implemented through a $132,000 grant from the Skaggs Foundation. \"This project protects our No. 1 resource - our health care workers,\" Skaggs Legacy Endowment Grant Committee Chairman Nita Jane Ayres said in a statement. \"Our health care workers already sacrifice so much but their safety should never be sacrificed.\"\\nThe plan is to double the rapid tests available in the next 60 days. With at-home rapid COVID-19 tests hard to come by and many stores limiting purchases, the White House on Friday acknowledged the current supply crunch, promising to double the number of rapid tests available for sale within the next two months. \"Youre right that the at-home rapid test is under a lot of demand,\" White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said, emphasizing that \"overall, testing capacity across the country remains robust.\" \"The manufacturing is scaling up significantly, doubling across the next couple of months, and we\\'re just going to keep at it to encourage those manufacturers to increase capacity and to drive down the cost of those tests.\" The White House has touted the effectiveness of its new vaccine mandates and employee testing requirements, and it has committed to shoring up testing by investing billions of dollars. Yet the U.S. has struggled since the start of the pandemic to meet demand for tests. As he began his tenure, President Joe Biden pledged a World War II-style production push to ramp up supply. But while PCR tests, which rely on labs to process them and take longer to produce results, are now widely available, the at-home rapid tests are hard to find. Demand for testing generally has soared some 300% to 650% in some areas of the country, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told senators Thursday, making the case that while \"sufficient supply\" remains, the issue becomes \"getting [it] to the right places.\" Senators on both sides of the aisle grilled Becerra on the testing shortage they\\'re seeing in their states, saying that even though the federal government has supplied billions of dollars for schools and businesses to acquire tests, actually securing them has become a challenge. \"You need to know that right now there is a real crush to be able to get the testing that can get the results back in a timely enough manner to make a difference,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said, adding that schools and businesses have told her \"there\\'s no place to get the testing, or certainly not to get the rapid test.\" Consumers have felt that crush at checkout. \"Due to high demand, deliveries may be delayed,\" reads a banner across the CVS at-home testing page. \"We appreciate your understanding as our associates work around the clock to support you.\" \"We may experience intermittent delays in supply in some locations and are working with all of our testing partners to meet patient demand,\" Walgreens corporate spokesperson Erin Loverher told ABC News. Following the doubling of testing volume in June to July, with much of the heightened consumption coming from the southern surge states, Walgreens is seeing \"incredible demand,\" the Loverher said. As such, a cap has been placed on over-the-counter at-home COVID testing products \"in an effort to help improve inventory,\" while the company continues to \"work diligently with our partners to best meet demand.\" CVS spokesperson Matthew Blanchette told ABC News the company has also begun to ration rapid test-kit purchases. In order to preserve the straining supplies of point-of-care and over-the-counter rapid tests, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked labs in September to use laboratory-based tests over rapid ones whenever possible to \"meet the current test demand\" despite what it called a \"temporary shortage.\" In late September, the Biden administration struck a new $1.2 billion deal for millions more rapid COVID-19 tests from Abbott and Celltrion, part of the $2 billion already announced by the White House to expand testing. Abbott spokesperson John Koval told ABC News that the company would be ramping up production significantly, and by the end of October it aims to produce \"as many or more\" rapid tests as at the height of their production -- surging capacity up to at least  50 million tests a month. The company is restarting production at its Illinois plant and rehiring in Maine after laying off several hundred workers when demand was down, Koval said. \"Overall, we\\'ll continue to pull every lever we can to further expand the manufacturing and the production of these tests in order to make them more widely available and to drive down the cost per test,\" Zients said Friday. ABC News\\' Anne Flaherty and Cheyenne Haslett contributed to this report.\\nThe COVID-19 vaccine will be added to the list of required vaccines for school. California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Friday that the state will require COVID-19 vaccines for all school children ages 12-17 once the FDA grants full approval, becoming the first state in the country to move forward on mandating vaccines for school children. The mandate will not be implemented earlier than January, when the next school term starts, and could come as late as July 2022, depending on when the FDA gives full approval for vaccines for kids under 16 years old. But Newsom, a Democrat, encouraged local districts to move more quickly if they see fit. \"I believe we will be the first state in America to move forward with this mandate and requirement but I do not believe, by any stretch of the imagination, we will be the last state,\" Newsom said during a press conference at a San Francisco school on Friday. Americans 12 years old and up are already eligible for the Pfizer vaccine under an emergency use authorization, but the vaccine has been fully approved -- an FDA process that takes longer -- for those over 16. \"Once the FDA approves the vaccination, in different cohorts starting with 12 and above -- grade 7 to 12 -- we will begin to apply that requirement in the next term, either January 1 or July 1, whichever comes sooner,\" Newsom said in a press conference on Friday. So far, no other state has required vaccines for school children, though private grade schools and universities around the country have done so. The requirement puts the vaccine on par with 10 other vaccines that are already required to attend school. California has so far vaccinated 63.5% of residents aged 12-17 with at least one dose, compared with 84% of all eligible residents. \"For 12 to 17, we\\'re not where we need to be. And so we hope this encourages folks to get vaccinated,\" Newsom said. At the same time as requirements go into place for 7th to 12th graders, the vaccine will also be required for all California school staff, including teachers, paraprofessionals, bus drivers and custodians. There will be exemptions allowed for medical reasons, personal beliefs and religious beliefs, as is the case with other vaccine requirements, Newsom said. \"We want to end this pandemic. We are all exhausted by it. And the purpose of this is to continue to lead in that space,\" Newsom said.\\nDays before the Supreme Court is set to resume in-person oral arguments for the first time in 18 months, Justice Brett Kavanaugh has tested positive for COVID-19, a court spokeswoman said on Friday. Kavanaugh, who has no symptoms and has been fully vaccinated since January, is the first member of the court known to have contracted the virus. All of the justices have been vaccinated since early this year, the court has said. The justices have been mostly convening virtually since March 2020 but are preparing to reopen the iconic courtroom to attorneys and a limited number of reporters for the fall docket of cases. On Monday, the justices met in-person in private for their first conference of the term. The court said all of the justices, including Kavanaugh, tested negative for coronavirus ahead of that meeting. Kavanaugh, 56, was informed Thursday evening that he had tested positive during a routine test ahead of an investiture ceremony for Justice Amy Coney Barrett that had been long postponed due to the pandemic, according to the court. \"As a precaution, Justice and Mrs. Kavanaugh will not attend Justice Barretts investiture this morning,\" the court\\'s spokesperson Patricia McCabe said in a press release. She noted that Kavanaugh\\'s family has tested negative for the virus. Barrett was scheduled to have a traditional investiture photo-op on Friday, walking down the steps of the Supreme Court Building with Chief Justice John Roberts and her husband. She was confirmed to the bench in October 2020; on Monday she will take her seat on the bench for the first time since the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\nThe rules are meant to reform the way authorities make deportation decisions. The Department of Homeland Security issued new immigration enforcement guidelines on Thursday in an effort to reform the way federal authorities make decisions about which unauthorized immigrants are priorities for deportation. The guidelines set forth a variety of \"mitigating factors\" that describe situations where arresting and removing someone might be deferred. Some examples include elderly people, young people, victims of crimes or those who have been in the U.S. for a \"lengthy\" amount of time. The approach gives Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents more discretion over who to deport. The memo establishing these guidelines lays out \"aggravating factors\" that might prompt federal authorities to make an arrest. However, it removes categories previously in place that outlined which specific criminal offenses would warrant making someone an enforcement priority. \"To treat people and questions of a public safety threat categorically like that actually is not effective,\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters. \"It could lead to ineffective and unjust results.\" Immigrant advocates reacted swiftly to the news, making clear they plan to hold the administration accountable given the broad nature of the guidelines. \"No matter where you are born, everyone deserves to be safe from detention and deportation, including people who have recently arrived in the United States seeking safety and protection and those who have had contact with the criminal legal system,\" said Stacy Suh of the Detention Watch Network, an organization that advocates for the abolishment of immigration detention centers. While advocates remain concerned that the guidelines still reflect hard-line measures by making \"public safety threats\" and recent border crossers a priority, the measures allow for a more holistic approach in assessing deportation priorities, the department said. The memo takes into consideration circumstances where a noncitizen might be exploited and unable to act due to their immigration status, Mayorkas said, offering the example of a landlord seeking unusually high rent or an employer paying low wages. \"The memorandum speaks of the need -- the obligation -- to guard against the use of immigration enforcement as a tool of retaliation for the assertion of legal rights,\" he said. Federal law enforcement personnel will now also consider a wider range of elements including race, religion, gender and sexual orientation if those factors are relevant to a person\\'s case in immigration court. Severe criminal offenses, as well as the \"use or threatened use of a firearm or dangerous weapon,\" would make an offender a higher priority for deportation, according to the new memo. The department will work on implementing the guidelines over the next two months before they officially take effect. A formal review of the protocols will be issued in three months, Mayorkas said.\\nHouse Democrats scrapped plans on Thursday to vote on the Senates bipartisan infrastructure agreement after leadership and the White House failed to bring progressives and moderates together behind a path forward for President Joe Bidens broader agenda. \"The President is grateful to Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer for their extraordinary leadership, and to Members from across the Democratic Caucus who have worked so hard the past few days to try to reach an agreement on how to proceed on the Infrastructure Bill and the Build Back Better plan,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Thursday night. \"A great deal of progress has been made this week, and we are closer to an agreement than ever. But we are not there yet, and so, we will need some additional time to finish the work, starting tomorrow morning first thing.\" \"While Democrats do have some differences, we share common goals of creating good union jobs, building a clean energy future, cutting taxes for working families and small businesses, helping to give those families breathing room on basic expenses--and doing it without adding to the deficit, by making those at the top pay their fair share,\" Psaki added. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., left the Capitol just after midnight, and told Rachel Scott that progressives and moderates are closer to reaching an agreement on the size of their social policy package than it appeared earlier in the week. \"We\\'re not trillions of dollars apart,\" Pelosi said. Asked about the vote on the Senate-approved infrastructure bill that didn\\'t take place Thursday, Pelosi said, \"There will be a vote today,\" in what appeared to be a reference to the legislative calendar. The decision to delay the vote came after Pelosi insisted Thursday morning that she planned to go ahead with a vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill -- despite progressive Democrats vowing to defeat it. \"We\\'re on a path to win. I don\\'t want to even consider any options other than that,\" Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference. \"We go in it to win it.\" Earlier, as she arrived on Capitol Hill, pressed by a reporter that the bill is facing \"insurmountable opposition at the moment,\" Pelosi responded that it\\'s \"our plan\" to bring the bill to vote Thursday, her self-imposed deadline. \"Hour by hour,\" she responded. \"You\\'re moment by moment. I\\'m hour-by-hour.\" \"You cannot tire. You cannot concede. This is the fun part,\" Pelosi said later at her news conference. \"Our best interest is served by passing this bill today.\" Yet her comments suggested the House was in a holding pattern, with no firm decision on whether to hold or cancel the vote. \"We are proceeding in a very positive direction,\" Pelosi said brightly, even though the bill has not been scheduled for the House floor and her top lieutenants have said publicly that it lacks the votes to pass. Meanwhile, the White House wasn\\'t ruling out Biden heading to Capitol Hill Thursday to make a last-minute push to House Democrats just before the big vote. While lawmakers were expected to agree separately on a government funding resolution with hours to spare Thursday, the outcome of the House vote on the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill -- central to Biden\\'s agenda -- was still in serious doubt. Pelosi spent the afternoon meeting with various factions of her caucus. Even as progressives left the meeting vowing to withhold support for the infrastructure bill absent progress on Democrats\\' larger agenda, two groups of moderates left meetings with Pelosi predicting a vote later Thursday evening. Progressive Democrats have all but guaranteed that they will defeat the bipartisan bill on the floor -- to the embarrassment of Pelosi who vowed to pass the bill this week -- absent any breakthroughs on the larger policy spending package. Those breakthroughs seem unlikely as negotiations between the White House and Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, who oppose the package\\'s $3.5 trillion price tag, have fallen flat. Roughly half of the nearly 100-member progressive caucus -- at least 50 members, urged on by Sen. Bernie Sanders -- have vowed to vote no on the bipartisan bill, effectively holding it hostage until a larger infrastructure bill passes via the reconciliation process. While progressives bashed Manchin and Sinema over their objections to the larger package, Pelosi praised Manchin at her news conference, calling the West Virginia Democrat \"a good member of Congress\" and said negotiations are focused on \"substance\" rather than \"rhetoric\" or \"dollars.\" At midday, Manchin told reporters his topline number for the larger bill -- that he\\'s conveyed to Biden -- is $1.5 trillion, something bound to harden progressive opposition and put the House vote in even more jeopardy. Attempting to also sway progressives, Pelosi said Thursday members should \"remove all doubt\" that there will not be a reconciliation bill following a bipartisan vote on Thursday. \"We will have a reconciliation bill. That is for sure. today the question is about. We are proceeding in a very positive way to bring up the bill, to bring up the \"BIF\" (the bipartisan infrastructure framework), and to do so in a way that can win. And so far so good for today, it\\'s going in a positive direction,\" she said. Pelosi, who met with her leadership team ahead of news conference, hinted that getting a larger human infrastructure and climate policy bill is vital to her and her legacy. \"I just told members of my leadership that the reconciliation bill was a culmination of my service in Congress \\'cause it was about the children,\" she said. But progressives appear to be holding firm in opposition. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., reiterated on Thursday that progressives are in the \"same place\" and will not vote to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill unless there is agreement with the moderate Democratic senators on a larger social spending package. \"We will not be able to vote for the infrastructure bill until the reconciliation bill has passed,\" Jayapal told reporters after a meeting with Pelosi. \"It\\'s not about trusting the speaker, it\\'s not about trusting the president, it\\'s really about the vote as an ironclad assurance from the Senate,\" she added, referring to Manchin and Sinema. At her midafternoon White House briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters, \"We\\'re working towards winning a vote tonight. We have several hours left in the day.\" She added, \"We know that compromise is inevitable. We\\'ve also seen that play out over the last couple of days. And right now, we\\'re clearly in the thick of it. Pelosi told ABC News\\' George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\" that she\\'s \"never bringing a bill to the floor that doesn\\'t have the votes\" -- raising questions of whether she\\'ll stop the vote in the 11th hour. Asked on Sunday by Stephanopoulos if she was confident that progressive members would vote yes, Pelosi answered, \"Well, let me just say we\\'re going to pass the bill this week.\" Biden stepped out of the White House Wednesday night, rubbing elbows at the congressional game with his former colleagues, appearing to be in good spirits, amid the tense legislative negotiations, while Pelosi appeared to do some last-minute lobbying on her cell phone, in a show of the stakes of the infrastructure bill passing this week -- as opposed to later. The $3.5 trillion bill progressives insist the House passes before or at the same time as the $1.2 trillion package includes significant new investments in health care, child care, higher education, workforce training, and paid family and medical leave which would include 12 weeks paid family and medical leave for most working Americans.\\nNewly retired boxing star Manny Pacquiao has filed his certificate of candidacy for the Philippine presidency at the start of the registration period for the May elections MANILA, Philippines -- Newly retired boxing star Manny Pacquiao filed his certificate of candidacy for the Philippine presidency Friday as registration opened for candidates seeking to lead a Southeast Asian nation that has been hit hard by the pandemic and deep political conflicts. Elections officials placed heavy restrictions to prevent the Oct. 1-8 registration period from drawing huge crowds of political supporters and becoming hotbeds for coronavirus infections. Aside from the presidency and vice presidency, more than 18,000 national, local and congressional posts will be contested in the elections on May 9, 2022. Considered an Asian bastion of democracy, the Philippines has also seen electoral mayhem and violence. In 2009, gunmen deployed by the family of Maguindanao provinces then-governor massacred 58 people, including journalists, in an attack on an election convoy that shocked the world. About 3,000 police officers, including some patrolling in armored police vans, were deployed around the seaside convention complex in Manila where presidential candidates were expected to register. The area was declared a no-fly and no-fishing zone. Aspirants can bring only up to three companions, who were required to undergo COVID-19 swab tests, when registering their candidacies to prevent past chaotic scenes of candidates showing up with movie stars, musical bands and rowdy mobs of followers. \"We really went to great extent to make sure that the filing would be sober,\" Commission on Elections spokesman James Jimenez said. Still, hundreds of fans and supporters in face masks and holding Pacquiaos portrait and small Philippine flags lined the street leading to the heavily secured elections registration center by Manila Bay to cheer his convoy. Many expect the race to succeed controversial President Rodrigo Duterte to be crowded and politically hostile. Pacquiao, former national police chief Panfilo Lacson and Manila Mayor Isko Moreno have declared they will seek the presidency and others are expected. Pacquiao and Duterte were staunch allies until they had a well-publicized falling out this year as the elections season loomed. The two and their camps fought over control of the ruling party and Duterte threatened to campaign against Pacquiao if the boxing legend could not prove his remarks that corruption has worsened under the current administration. \"Those who take advantage of the nation, stealing, robbing the Filipino nation, your happy days of taking advantage in the government are already numbered because if the Lord places me there, I promise not only to the Filipino people, but also my promise to God, that they all will be put in prison,\" Pacquiao told reporters after registering his candidacy. The 42-year-old senator announced his retirement from boxing Wednesday after winning fans with his rags-to-riches life story and legendary career. Duterte, 76, has accepted the ruling partys nomination for him to run as vice president in a move that whipped up a constitutional debate and shocked opponents who have long condemned him as a human rights calamity. Philippine presidents are constitutionally limited to a single, six-year term, and a constitutional expert has said he would question Dutertes candidacy before the Supreme Court since a successful vice-presidential run would put him within one step of the office again. Western governments led by the United States and human rights activists have long raised the alarm over Dutertes police-enforced crackdown against illegal drugs that has left more than 6,000 mostly petty drug suspects dead since he took office in mid-2016. The killings are being investigated by the International Criminal Court. Although Duterte remains popular based on opinion polls, the drug killings, along with his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to one of the worst economic recessions and widespread unemployment and hunger, are expected to be key issues in the elections. Activists have long compared Duterte to the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who was ousted in a 1986 army-backed \"people power\" revolt that became a harbinger of change in authoritarian regimes worldwide. A son and namesake of Marcos, former senator Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., is expected to contest the presidency and has received good support in independent opinion polls. \"The stakes are high for Philippine democracy,\" Manila-based analyst Julio Teehankee said, adding the candidate who can provide a clear and workable roadmap to navigate the country out of the pandemic and economic shocks would have a crucial edge. The Philippines has reported more than 2.5 million COVID-19 cases, with 38,164 deaths in the second-worst pandemic tolls in Southeast Asia after Indonesia. ------ Associated Press journalists Kiko Rosario and Jim Gomez contributed to this report.\\nThe clothing found matched what Xavior Harrelson was last seen wearing. The remains of an adolescent were discovered by a farmer in rural Iowa Thursday, along with clothes that matched what a boy who lived in the region was last seen wearing before he vanished in May, authorities said. Xavior Harrelson was last seen the morning of May 27, days before his 11th birthday, when he left his home in Montezuma to go on a bike ride, authorities said. His disappearance sparked a widespread search by police and community volunteers through miles of cornfields, lakes, ravines and wilderness in Poweshiek County. Around 2 p.m. local time Thursday, the local sheriff\\'s office received a call from a farmer working in a field a few miles outside of Montezuma who had discovered what they believed to be human remains, authorities said. The remains were found in a grassy area of a combined field, and the state medical examiner determined them to be human and likely those of an adolescent, according to Mitch Mortvedt, assistant director of Iowa\\'s Division of Criminal Investigation. \"We are not saying it is Xavior Harrelson at this time,\" Mortvedt told reporters at a press briefing near the scene Thursday. \"There\\'s a lot of work yet to be done at the scene here, and as you can imagine, the state medical examiner\\'s office and state anthropologist have a lot of work left ahead of them in the days and weeks, even, to come.\" The remains had likely been in the field for a \"significant\" amount of time, Mortvedt said, and the documentation at the scene will be a \"very slow and methodical process.\" The clothing found was \"consistent with what we knew Xavior to last be wearing,\" he said. Xavior was last seen wearing a red T-shirt, blue pajama pants and black high-top shoes, according to the sheriff\\'s office. His family has been contacted about the development, Poweshiek County Sheriff Thomas Kriegel told reporters. \"Naturally she was upset,\" he said of the boy\\'s mother. The field where the remains were found had not been previously searched on foot as part of the investigation, Kriegel said. The medical examiner will be working to identify the remains, a process that could take weeks, Mortvedt said. The cause and manner of death will be investigated, and \"whether or not there was foul play,\" he said. A reward for information in the case has grown to $36,000. Anyone with information or tips is urged to call the Poweshiek County Sheriff\\'s Office at 641-623-5679.\\nWhen Walt Disney dreamed up his \"Florida Project,\" I think he had days like this in mind. I was standing at the gates of Magic Kingdom Park this morning as guests cheered with joy as they entered the park to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World Resort. This was a moment five decades in the making, and we were fortunate to capture a few snapshots of the magical moments happening all over the park. We met parents and children, siblings, friends ... it was a day for being with loved ones, celebrating their collective love for Walt Disney World. From daybreak at Cinderella Castle to Disney bounding to popcorn and so much more, Oct. 1, 2021, will live on in the memories of so many, adding to the tapestry of magical moments Walt Disney World has created for millions upon millions who came before us today. And ... this is just the beginning! \"The Worlds Most Magical Celebration\" continues for the next 18 months, and well be following it all along the way here on the Disney Parks Blog. Keep checking back with us here and follow #DisneyWorld50 on social channels to be part of the fun. We hope to see you real soon!\\nLast week, we introduced you to the Class of 1971 -- the cast members who are celebrating 50 years of service alongside the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World Resort. Today wed like to introduce you to one of those inspiring cast members: Forrest. Forrest Bahruth has spent his entire career in Disney Live Entertainment. He was here for many of the most historical and memorable moments in The Walt Disney Companys history, marking a true dedication to dreaming, inspiring and creating a world of entertainment and magic. In 1968, Forrest was hired as a consultant choreographer at Disneyland Resort helping to bring the first large stage show at the park to life. Soon after its success, he was asked to choreograph the 1971 Grand Dedication Opening at Walt Disney World. It was then that he officially became a Disney cast member. Over the past 50 years, Forrest has staged and choreographed thousands of Disney Live Entertainment shows all over the world. From parades, castle shows and nighttime spectaculars to marketing tours, dedications and TV specials -- if you have a favorite Disney Parks show, Forrest was probably involved. Earlier this year, Forrest was recognized by his fellow cast members and leaders with a 50-year service celebration at Magic Kingdom. The event included the presentation of Forrests 50-year service award statue, featuring Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Along with Forrests leaders and coworkers, Walt Disney World Ambassadors Stephen and Raevon were also there to share in the celebration and recognition. \"In 1923, Walt Disney started this company,\" Stephen said. \"If you do the math, he spent 43 years of his life building Disney. What is special about today is that we get to celebrate a cast member who has exceeded that milestone. Today, we get to celebrate Forrest, who has had the privilege and honor to serve The Walt Disney Company for 50 years.\" As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World Resort today, the curtain closes on Forrests Disney career. He spent his final day at work in Magic Kingdom Park this morning -- taking in the magic as a cast member one last time, and snapping a selfie after watching the new 50th Anniversary Let the Magic Begin Welcome Show on the Cinderella Castle stage. As Show Director, Forrest played an important role in bringing the show to life by helping with its rehearsals and staging before its debut this morning. \"Time goes by very quickly when you are involved in creating the Disney magic,\" Forrest said. \"It still has the same energy it did 50 years ago. I love Disney, the guests and my fellow cast members.\" When asked what he will miss most, Forrest said it was the love and admiration the cast members have for each other and the guests.\\nAn epic Digital Pin Experience is about to begin, and you wont want to miss it.

As we reflect on this historic moment together, there is no better way to commemorate this occasion than by giving back to the community weve called home all this time. Our Central Florida family has played such an important role for us since Walt Disney World Resort opened in 1971. Its where our cast members live, go to school, raise their families and thrive. For decades, we have remained inspired by the local nonprofits and magic makers in our community who make a difference for so many - giving back to these organizations is a proud tradition we are committed to continuing into the future. In celebration of our 50th anniversary, I am deeply humbled to share that Disney is granting a total of $3 million to six amazing nonprofit organizations in Central Florida, helping to support important causes and inspire a world of difference for children and families in our community.

Physicians went beyond the call of duty to make sure their patients felt safe in a time of uncertainty; high schoolers put aside their after-school fun to assist elderly members of their community, and neighbors from every corner of the country answered the call to help so that no one in their neighborhood was left behind. The Disney Magic Makers contest was created to shine a light on all of the people whose good deeds spark everyday magic. Magic comes in all shapes and sizes, from sincere and simple acts between neighbors to massive acts of kindness and generosity. To honor their contributions, Disney searched the nation to find 50 amazing Disney Magic Makers and rewarded them with a trip to Walt Disney World Resort in celebration of its 50th anniversary and a one-year subscription to Disney+. The 50 Disney Magic Makers chosen reminded us that we all have the power to make a difference. The friendship of two women in Ohio sparked a vaccine revolution for elderly and at-risk members; local heroes in Utah, Illinois and California showed that the good deeds of one person can affect an entire community; a high schooler in Ohio and a college student in Rhode Island proved that one is never too young to bring awareness to a cause; the Muppets slap-stick quipster Fozzie Bear even received a nomination for bringing magic to his peers; and in celebration of the inaugural World Princess Week, we discovered women from all corners of the nation whose acts of service embody the temperament of a Disney hero. And that was just the tip of the iceberg. Today, Walt Disney World Resort kicks off the 50th celebration and new Disney Magic Makers have been chosen for their work in changing the lives of people in their community. James Gordon works as the principal of Oak Grove/Bellemeade Elementary School where he serves predominantly Black families in southside Richmond, VA. To ensure no family went hungry, James organized food drives and distributed full turkey meals to families during Thanksgiving for over three years. In addition, James developed the AAA program (Attitude, Attendance, and Achievement) with the goal of encouraging students to strive for excellence. But his most prominent contribution is awarding five elementary school students from low-income families with full scholarships to Virginia Union University, an HBCU in Richmond. Disney was so inspired by James goodwill that we brought him to Walt Disney World Resort to surprise him with the news that weve donated an extra $50,000 to his college fund to help him continue the good work. Weve always believed that our cast members were the original magic makers, and Chef Ashley Keyes of Atlanta, GA is a former culinary intern who continued to spread magic long after she left Disney. Ashleys passion in life is to feed and serve people and she is now the Executive Chef for C.H.O.I.C.E.S. (The Center Helping Obesity In Children End Successfully, Inc.) where she offers free cooking classes for families in and around her community. Ashley also hosts mobile food distributions. Since the pandemic, she has passed out 20,000 pounds of food to over 500 families each month! Lauren Page of Miami, FL felt all children should have access to literature. She founded Page by Page and has so far distributed over $1.5 million worth of books to more than 450,000 underprivileged children around the world. In May 2020 during the pandemic, Lauren delivered over 30,000 books to the doorsteps of children who were at home with no internet access and provided books for the public to take at COVID-19 test facilities. These Disney Magic Makers, and the thousands whose stories have yet to be heard, all had one thing in common: they wanted to help. Though the contest has ended, the footprint these individuals have left behind will inspire communities for years to come.\\nWe hope youre feeling all the magic in the air as Walt Disney World Resort begins its 50th anniversary celebration!

A major oil spill off the coast of Southern California has forced Huntington Beach and activities scheduled to take place in the region to shut down. On Saturday, Huntington Beach Mayor Kim Carr said a leak from an offshore oil production facility leaked 3,000 barrels of oil, which is about 126,000 gallons, but on Monday night, state and federal officials updated the potential oil spill amount to 144,000 gallons, meaning it was worse than initially believed. The leak is expected to have occurred about 4.5 miles offshore, officials said. The U.S. Coast Guard was notified of the spill around 9 a.m. Saturday, Carr said. By early Sunday morning, the oil had reached the shore. It had entered the Talbert Marshlands and the Santa Ana River Trail, fanning out over an area of about 5.8 nautical miles, the city of Huntington Beach announced in a press release Sunday morning. The size of the spill \"demanded prompt and aggressive action,\" officials said, but the pipeline has been capped and is no longer leaking into the ocean. Skimming equipment and booms have been deployed to prevent the oil from flowing into the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve and Huntington Beach Wetlands, according to the city. On Sunday night, Laguna Beach closed all its beaches, asking that \"all individuals remain clear of the beach and pay close attention to any beach closure or warning signs,\" according to a statement released by the city. \"Some bad news for my Laguna Beach constituents (and everyone else). I just learned projections have the #HuntingtonBeachOilSpill reaching Crystal Cove around 10pm tonight. We need more resources deployed ASAP. And then we need to end all offshore oil drilling off the CA coast,\" California Sen. Dave Min tweeted. The Coast Guard has recovered 3,150 gallons of oil from the water as of Sunday night, and 5,360 feet of boom have been deployed, they said in a statement. The shoreside response was conducted by 105 government agency personnel. Fourteen boats conducted oil recovery operations while three Coast Guard boats enforced a safety zone off 1,000 yards around the oil spill boats. Also, four aircrafts were dispatched for overflight assessments. It is not yet clear what caused the spill. The final day of the Pacific Airshow was canceled in order to facilitate cleanup operations, city officials announced Sunday morning. In addition, residents were advised not to swim, surf or exercise near the beach due to the potential health hazards, such as toxic fumes. The oil spill is already affecting wildlife, with dead birds and fish already washing up on the beaches, Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley tweeted. Newport Beach Mayor Brad Avery reported to Foley that he saw dolphins swimming through the slick oil plumes as he headed back to shore from Catalina, Foley tweeted. Foley told ABC News she believes the spill is \"irreversible.\" \"You cant get wildlife back that are killed in this process, and some of the habitat the plant species, theyre going to be impacted for years to come,\" she said. She added that the damage to the environment isn\\'t the only thing she fears as she has received reports of surfers getting sick. \"It feels like you have a thick coating in your mouth, if you\\'re out there too long. Its definitely the vapors in the air, and theyre impacting the environment,\" she said. Marine animals will be taken to the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, where they will be triaged and later sent to Sea World San Diego for rehabilitation, animal rescuers told ABC News. The Pacific Marine Mammal Center is currently in a \"holding pattern\" as it awaits the arrival of oiled animals in the next hours, days and weeks, Krysta Higuchi, communications representative for the organization, told ABC News. The center is \"preparing for the worst, hoping for the best,\" Higuchi said. Ocean conservation nonprofit Oceana urged policymakers to begin a widespread shift to clean energy and to end offshore drilling to prevent future spills. \"This is just the latest tragedy of the oil industry,\" Jacqueline Savitz, chief policy officer for, told ABC News. \"The reality of our reliance on oil and gas is on full display here.\" Saturday\\'s spill is just the latest in American waters this past month. After Hurricane Ida tore through the Gulf Coast in early September, it left a trail of oil in its wake, with nearly 350 oil spills reported to the Coast Guard in the days after the storm made landfall. An analysis by the organization also found that ending new leasing for offshore oil and gas in the U.S. could prevent over 19 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions as well as more than $720 billion in damages to people, property and the environment in the country. The risk of oil spills may rise a climate change creates stronger offshore disturbances, experts told ABC News. The California Department of Wildlife has set up a hotline to report wildlife impacted by the oil. Individuals are advised not to handle the wildlife but to report incidents to 877-823-6926.

An 11-year-old girl was shot to death and her 5-year-old sister was wounded in Milwaukee on Saturday night when a gunman in a passing vehicle unleashed a barrage of bullets targeting a family car the girls were sitting in, authorities said. The shooting unfolded around 9 p.m. local time in the Sherman Park neighborhood in northwest Milwaukee, according to Milwaukee Police Department. The girls were taken to Children\\'s Hospital in Milwaukee, where the 11-year-old died from her injuries, the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner told ABC affiliate station WISN in Milwaukee. The younger girl was in stable condition, police said. The girls were in the car with family members when a vehicle pulled up alongside them and shots rang out, police said. A relative immediately drove the wounded children to the District 7 police precinct several blocks away, where officers and firefighters from the Milwaukee Fire Department performed first aid, according to WISN. The names of the children were not immediately released. No arrests have been made and police are asking for the public\\'s help in identifying the suspect. The shooting marked the 148th homicide in Milwaukee this year, according to a database on homicides compiled by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. At least 22 of the homicide victims this year have been children 18 years old or younger, according to the newspaper. The city of roughly 600,000 had a record 190 homicides in 2020. The Gun Violence Archive, an online database that tracks homicides and shootings, shows that at least 1,156 children 17 years old and younger have been shot to death nationwide in 2021, and another 3,182 have been wounded.\\nSALT LAKE CITY -- Police arrested a man early Sunday in connection with the shooting death of Utah sophomore cornerback Aaron Lowe. Homicide detectives with the Salt Lake City Police Department located Buk M. Buk, 22, in Draper and booked him on charges of aggravated murder, attempted murder and felony discharge of a firearm. Online jail records do not indicate if he has an attorney who can speak on his behalf. \"Because of the incredible work of our homicide detectives, we have justice for Aaron,\" Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said during a news conference Sunday. \"When I talked to Aaron\\'s mother on Monday, I made her a promise. We would find her sons alleged killer.\" Brown did not discuss a motive and declined to answer questions from reporters. But he did say the shooting was not a targeted attack on the university, its athletic department or Lowe, nor was it gang-related. Lowe, 21, was shot at a house party just after midnight Sept. 26 after other, uninvited guests were asked to leave, police said. A 20-year-old woman also was shot and critically injured at the party, which was thrown hours after the Utes beat Washington State 24-13. Police had previously received noise complaints about the party, but officers didn\\'t respond because they were dealing with other emergency calls, police spokesman Brent Weisberg has said. When dispatchers got a call about a fight with a weapon more than an hour later, officers immediately went to the house in the Sugar House neighborhood. Lowe\\'s death came less than a year after his teammate Ty Jordan was killed in an accidental shooting. Lowe was a high school teammate of Jordans in Mesquite, Texas, and switched his jersey from No. 2 to No. 22 to honor his friend after the 19-year-old died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen on Christmas night 2020. In August, Lowe was named the first recipient of the Ty Jordan Memorial Scholarship, voted on by the team. The Utes credited Lowe for persuading Jordan to play at Utah after decommitting from the school. Jordan was named the Pac-12 freshman of the year and led all freshmen nationally in rushing yards per game before he was killed. Lowe appeared in 16 combined games on special teams his first two seasons and played in four games this season.\\nFormer U.S. Rep. Todd Akin, a conservative Missouri Republican whose comment that women\\'s bodies have a way of avoiding pregnancies in cases of \"legitimate rape\" sunk his bid for the U.S. Senate and became a cautionary tale for other GOP candidates, has died. He was 74. Akin had cancer for several years, his son Perry said in a statement. He died late Sunday at his home in Wildwood, a St. Louis suburb. \"As my fathers death approached, we had people from all different walks of life share story after story of the personal impact he had on them,\" Perry Akin said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"He was a devout Christian, a great father, and a friend to many. We cherish many fond memories from him driving the tractor at our annual hayride, to his riveting delivery of the freedom story at 4th of July parties dressed in the full uniform of a colonial minuteman. The family is thankful for his legacy: a man with a servants heart who stood for truth.\" Akin represented a Republican-leaning eastern Missouri district that included St. Louis-area suburbs for 12 years, giving up a safe seat to run for the U.S. Senate in 2012. He emerged from a crowded GOP primary to challenge then incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, only to seriously hurt Republicans\\' chances of recapturing a Senate majority less than two weeks later. Akin, a strong abortion opponent, was asked during an interview by a St. Louis television station whether he supported allowing abortions for women who have been raped. He answered that \"from what I understand from doctors\" that such pregnancies are \"really rare.\" He added: \"If its a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\" His comments sparked an outcry. The Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, immediately rebuked Akin and said his campaign would allow abortions in such cases. Criticism of Akin\\'s remarks clouded his U.S. Senate bid until the end, making him a symbol of how Republicans could fumble away races they had a good chance of winning with a candidate deemed too far to the right. Akin\\'s campaign initially said he \"misspoke,\" and Akin later said he was wrong. Akin faced pressure from the national GOP to withdraw and allow the state party to pick a replacement. He refused and ended up losing the race by nearly 16 percentage points, receiving 39% of the vote. Yet other Republican officials and officeholders across the U.S. occasionally echoed his remarks -- signaling how conservative some of the party\\'s base had become on the issue. Two years later, Akin published a book, \"Firing Back,\" in which he accused GOP leaders of abandoning him and letting McCaskill win and labeling news organizations as bullies. In the book, he also retracted his public apology for his \"legitimate rape\" remark. Akin never ran for office again, though early in 2015, he briefly fueled speculation about a 2016 primary challenge to GOP U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt with remarks that tea party Republicans wanted \"new blood.\" Akin was born July 5, 1947, in New York City, but grew up in the St. Louis area. He received a bachelor\\'s degree in engineering and management from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts in 1970, served in the U.S. Army and worked for IBM. He worked in corporate management at the St. Louis-based Laclede Steel Co. He won a seat in the Missouri House in 1988 and served in the Legislature for 10 years. He won Missouri\\'s 2nd Congressional District seat in 2000 and was reelected five times. He also served on the board of the anti-abortion group Missouri Right to Life. Republican U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, who has represented Missouri\\'s 2nd District since winning election in 2012, said in a statement that Akin \"was a man of great faith and an unwavering conservative. He was deeply devoted to God, his Country, and Family.\" Another Republican congressman from eastern Missouri, Blaine Luetkemeyer, called Akin \"a dedicated husband, father, grandfather and public servant, serving the Show-Me-State for decades at both the state and federal level.\" In the 2012 U.S. Senate primary, Akin faced two formidable opponents, former State Treasurer Sarah Steelman and businessman John Brunner. Many Democrats thought McCaskill\\'s best shot at winning reelection would be with Akin as the GOP nominee. Her campaign aired television ads suggesting Akin was too conservative, Brunner was not a reliable conservative and Steelman represented \"more politics as usual.\" Republicans took the ads as McCaskill\\'s attempt to help Akin win the GOP primary. An autobiography that McCaskill published in 2015 said she also tried to boost Akin\\'s campaign by urging it through back channels to resume airing a television ad featuring an endorsement from former conservative GOP presidential candidate and ex-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. McCaskill\\'s moves paid off. Akin prevailed in the eight-person GOP field with only 36% of the vote. Funeral information has not been announced. Survivors include Akin\\'s wife, Lulli Boe Akin, his mother, Nancy Bigelow Akin, four sons, two daughters and 18 grandchildren. ------ Hanna reported from Topeka, Kansas. Salter reported from O\\'Fallon, Missouri.\\nIn an exclusive interview with ABC News\\' George Stephanopoulos, Stephanie Grisham, one of former President Donald Trump\\'s most senior and longest-serving advisers, said she regrets enabling a culture of dishonesty at the White House. \"You are talking about this cultural culture of casual dishonesty at the White House, so you were, as press secretary, even if you weren\\'t getting briefings, enabling that culture, weren\\'t you?\" Stephanopoulos asked Grisham on Good Morning America Monday morning. Grisham, whose new tell-all book \"I\\'ll Take Your Questions Now\" is out this week, responded, \"Yes, I was. And I\\'ve reflected on that and I regret that. Especially now when watching him, and so many people, push the false election narrative. I now want to, in whatever way I can, educate the public about the behaviors within the White House because it does look like he\\'s going to try to run in 2024.\" Stephanopoulos challenged Grisham, who served nearly the entire four-year term in the Trump White House before resigning after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, asking, \"but you stayed until the final two weeks ... what took you so long?\" \"Yes, that\\'s a fair question and it\\'s a complicated question,\" Grisham responded, adding that she was at first drawn to Trump\\'s ability to attract large crowds and his support among Republicans. But she said that when she joined the West Wing, she \"started to see what it was really like and I regretted that decision immediately.\" The former president has forcefully responded to the latest tell-all book by a former close ally, with Melania Trump\\'s office saying in a statement, \"The author is desperately trying to rehabilitate her tarnished reputation by manipulating and distorting the truth about Mrs. Trump. Ms. Grisham is a deceitful and troubled individual who doesn\\'t deserve anyone\\'s trust.\" Grisham, who also told Stephanopoulos it was the former president who told her not to hold briefings during her time in the role, said she is unsure if she could have done more to protect a young female staffer who she writes in her new book Trump had developed a \"unusual interest\" in and had \"behaved inappropriately\" toward. \"Should you have done more to protect her?\" Stephanopoulos pressed. Grisham responded, \"I don\\'t know if I could have, there\\'s, there\\'s not an HR department at the White House,\" before Stephanopoulos pushed back and suggested she could have brought the issue to White House chief of staff. \"I didn\\'t feel comfortable talking to Mark Meadows,\" Grisham responded. \"I don\\'t believe he would have done anything. So I did the best I could, in terms of never letting her be alone with him in the cabin. I tried to keep her off trips as often as I could. I did the best I could, I think, in that environment.\" Another major theme in the book is the former president\\'s infatuation with world dictators. Grisham recalls how the former president tried to cozy up to Russia\\'s Vladimir Putin during an overseas trip for the Group of 20 summit in Osaka in 2019. \"How do you explain why the president was so placating of President Putin?\" Stephanopoulos asked. Grisham said that, in her opinion, \"I got the feeling that he wanted to impress dictators, I think he almost admired how tough they were.\" While other top aides resigned or were forced out, with some even speaking out against Trump while he was still in office, Grisham stood by the president throughout nearly the entirety of the Trump administration\\'s four-year term, through numerous controversies -- and when asked on Monday by Stephanopoulos if it was a mistake to work for President Trump, she quickly replied, \"Yes.\" \"Why do it?\" Stephanopoulos asked. \"I do believe he gave voice to a lot of people who did feel forgotten,\" Grisham said. \"But I think that many of us, myself included, got into that White House, and got heavy with power and ... we didn\\'t think about serving the country anymore, it was about surviving.\"\\n\"Now I understand that it has nothing to do with me,\" she told ABC News. Growing up, Shelley Lynn Thornton said she had a nice childhood with parents who she knew adopted her and took good care of her. As a teenager, she said her biggest concerns were \"shoes and boys.\" She had no reason to think much beyond herself, until reporters at the National Enquirer revealed her birth identity to her around her 19th birthday in 1989. Her biological mother, they told her, was Norma McCorvey. \"They\\'d asked me if I\\'d ever heard of her before and I said no,\" Thornton, 51, told ABC News\\' Linsey Davis in an exclusive interview. \"And they said, \\'Well, she is the woman who they used to do the Roe versus Wade case. She was Jane Roe.\\'\" Thornton\\'s identity has been unknown to the public for more than 50 years. She was first named as McCorvey\\'s daughter last month in an article published in The Atlantic. She is speaking out now, she told ABC News, in her first on-camera interview, because \"it\\'s my turn.\" \"My story is my story,\" Thornton said. Watch the full interview on ABC News Live TONIGHT at 7 p.m. ET. \\'Oh God, everybody\\'s going to hate me\\' Nineteen years earlier, McCorvey, then 22 and unmarried, was pregnant and having already given up two babies decided she didn\\'t want to have a third. At that time, the legality of abortion was based on state\\'s decisions, and McCorvey was in Texas, where it was illegal. She went on to become the plaintiff, going by the pseudonym \"Jane Roe,\" in the case that made abortion a federally protected right. But the Supreme Court didn\\'t make that decision until 1973. By then, McCorvey had already given birth and placed the child, who was Thornton, for adoption. Before she was hit with this news at age 19, Thornton said she hadn\\'t thought much about abortion. Most of what she knew, she said, was the \"Hollywood version\" based on movies. Within the scope of her family, abortion was \"a non-thing,\" she said. Especially as someone who was adopted, she had grown up with the idea that \"if a family member had a baby, they couldn\\'t take care of it then somebody else in the family took it and took care of it.\" The reporters had contacted Thornton -- without disclosing they were reporters, she said -- and said they\\'d tell her the identity of her biological mother at a restaurant in Seattle\\'s Space Needle, so she went with Ruth, the mother who raised her. After dropping her identity on her, she said the reporters asked Thornton if she was \"pro-choice or pro-life.\" She said she told them she didn\\'t even know what that meant. Ruth shut down the meeting and got Thornton out of the situation. Leaving, Thornton says she completely broke down. \"My whole thinking is that, \\'Oh God, everybody\\'s going to hate me because everyone\\'s going to blame me for abortion being legal.\\' You know, it\\'s like \\'it\\'s all my fault,\\' is pretty much what I was thinking,\" she said. \"And that\\'s really hard to grasp when you\\'re in that kind of a situation and you\\'re just kind of like learning all of this stuff.\" \\'She didn\\'t deserve to meet me\\' McCorvey died in 2017, and her own opinion on abortion -- if it was ever truly black and white -- went to the grave with her. She became publicly known shortly after the Supreme Court decision and became part of the abortion rights activist movement in the 1980s, making appearances and announcing she wanted to find the child she\\'d placed for adoption. But in the 1990s, McCorvey joined activists on the anti-abortion side. That was thought to be her opinion -- until the documentary \"AKA Jane Roe\" was released in 2020 including a late-life interview where she said she wasn\\'t actually against abortion. She claimed she had been paid by the anti-abortion movement to say she was. \"I think she was taken advantage of by both sides, but I think she also took advantage of both sides,\" Thornton told ABC News. Thornton talked to McCorvey on the phone after the Space Needle ambush. \"It became apparent to me really quickly that the only reason why she wanted to reach out to me and find me was because she wanted to use me for publicity,\" Thornton said. She never agreed to meet her biological mother in person and has \"no regrets\" about that, not just because of how they were introduced, but also because of comments McCorvey had made to the press about alternatively feeling guilty for placing her for adoption and wishing she\\'d gotten the abortion. \"She didn\\'t deserve to meet me,\" Thornton said. \"She never did anything in her life to get that privilege back. She never expressed genuine feeling for me or genuine remorse for doing the things that she did, saying the things that she did over and over and over again. She wasn\\'t sorry, about giving me away or anything.\" Thornton has never forgiven McCorvey and has no plans to do so, \"mostly because I feel that she could have handled things a lot better,\" including by being \"upfront\" about wanting to meet her for the media attention. \"I can deal with that. I can\\'t deal with lies and treachery and things like that. To me, that\\'s like no, sorry, not playing that game with you. And that\\'s all it was. It was a game. It was a game. I was just a pawn, and I wasn\\'t going to let her do it,\" she said. \\'I\\'m not going to let either side use me\\' Thornton is wary of anyone trying to make her a pawn in their game. No longer 19, she has an opinion on abortion, but she keeps it \"close to my chest.\" \"I don\\'t really talk about that just because I\\'m not going to let either side use me for their advantage,\" she said, \"because that\\'s not me and -- you know -- find somebody else.\" This particular moment is ripe for opinions with little room for nuance. Last month, the Supreme Court allowed a law to go into effect in Texas -- where McCorvey\\'s case started -- that is a near-total ban on abortion. Later this year, the Supreme Court is hearing another case that directly challenges the decision Thornton\\'s conception made happen. Since that fateful meeting with the National Enquirer reporters 30 years ago, Thornton has come to terms with the fact that \"the actions of Norma are not mine.\" The story people try to put on her, the blame she initially felt for others\\' feelings -- she\\'s outgrown them. \"I had nothing to do with it,\" she said. \"I was just a little itty-bitty thing and, you know, circumstances prevailed.\" Keeping her biological identity a secret for three decades has been a weight on her, but she made a stable life for herself with a husband, career and kids of her own. She also has been able to open up with her biological sisters. Before Thornton, McCorvey gave birth to two daughters, who were also placed for adoption. Thornton was able to connect with one of them in their early 40s. \"It was an instant bond between us,\" her older sister Jennifer Ferguson said in a joint interview with ABC News. \"We have a lot of similarities. We both like the same colors, we both like to do the same crafts and things like that. We both have probably about the same patience level with things.\" Ferguson said Thornton choosing to keep her identity a secret for so long was \"a big burden\" for Thornton. \"For her to have to keep that under lock and key for so many years and not talk about it, it can only hurt, and she doesn\\'t want to do that anymore,\" Ferguson said. \"So, yeah, I\\'m 100% behind her.\" The two women said they talk almost daily now and have a close bond. \"I know that no matter what I do, what I say, where I go, whether if she agrees with it or not, she\\'s going to have my back 100%,\" Thornton said. \"She\\'s not going to let anybody take advantage of me and she\\'s not going to let anybody get away with anything because I\\'m her baby sister.\"\\nTwo weeks before the \"calamity\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen predicts could strike by Oct. 18, President Joe Biden on Monday blasted Republicans for \"playing Russian roulette with the U.S. economy\" in refusing to join Democrats to raise the debt ceiling so the U.S. does not default on its debt for the first time ever. \"The Republicans in Congress -- what they are doing today is so reckless and dangerous in my view. Raising the debt limit is It\\'s about paying what we already owe, what has already been acquired. Not anything new,\" Biden said. \"The United States is a nation that pays its bills and always has. From its inception, we have never defaulted.\" \"Not only are Republicans refusing to do their job, they are threatening to use their power to prevent us from doing our job, saving the economy from a catastrophic event. Frankly, I think it\\'s hypocritical, dangerous, and disgraceful. Their obstruction and irresponsibility knows no bounds, especially as we are clawing our way out of this pandemic,\" he continued. Biden\\'s amping up the pressure on the GOP to get on board comes ahead of Senate Republicans planning to block another bill this week to raise the debt limit -- an issue lawmakers have historically come together on for years. Democrats are trying to pass a straightforward debt limit hike on their own with 50 votes -- and no Republican support. But Republicans are filibustering the Democratic strategy -- requiring 60 votes to move forward -- and insisting that Democrats raise the debt ceiling through the much more complicated process of budget reconciliation that Biden says could involve hundreds of votes that could mean it wouldn\\'t get in time to avoid catastrophe. Republicans have said they won\\'t support spending on Biden\\'s agenda, while Democrats are reiterating the point that raising the debt ceiling does not authorize new government spending but allows the government to pay for spending that previous politicians have already OK\\'d -- including former President Donald Trump and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Biden seized on that point. \"Raising the debt limit is usually a bipartisan undertaking. And it should be. That is what is not happening today,\" Biden said. \"The reason we have to raise the debt limit is in part because of the reckless tax and spending policies under the previous Trump administration.\" \"Republicans in Congress raised the debt three times when Donald Trump was president. Each time the Democratic support. Now they won\\'t raise it. Even though they are responsible for more than $8 trillion in bills incurred in four years under the previous administration,\" he claimed. He called on Republicans to allow Democrats to hold a vote this week without \"procedural tricks,\" he said, because at this point, \"We are not expecting Republicans to do their part.\" \"We are simply asking them not to use procedural tricks to block them from doing the job they won\\'t do. A meteor is headed for our economy,\" Biden said. \"You don\\'t want to help save the country? Get out-of-the-way so you don\\'t destroy it.\" Biden also gave a warning to Americans on the effects they could feel in the coming days. \"In the days ahead, even before the default date, people may see the value of their retirement accounts shrink. They might see interest rates go up, ultimately raising their mortgage and car payments. The American people, look, just say it this way. As soon as this week, your savings and your pocketbook could be directly impacted by this Republican stunt,\" he said. Asked following his remarks if it\\'s possible the U.S. will not pay its debt, Biden said he couldn\\'t guarantee it. \"I can\\'t believe that will be the end result because the consequence is so dire. I don\\'t believe that. But can I guarantee it? If I could, I would, but I can\\'t,\" he said, before leaving the room. The impassioned plea echoed the treasury secretary\\'s at a hearing last week, where she warned raising the debt ceiling is \"necessary to avert a catastrophic event for our economy.\" \"It has nothing to do with future programs of payments, it\\'s entirely about paying bills that have already been incurred by this Congress, in previous Congresses, and it\\'s about making good on past commitments -- as you said, paying our credit card bill,\" Yellen said in a hearing last week. While lawmakers came together and voted to avoid a government shutdown, Democrats were forced to remove language from that bill that would have also raised the debt ceiling as Republicans argue they\\'ll have to go at it alone through the lengthy, budget reconciliation process. McConnell, in a letter to Biden ahead of his remarks, reiterated his party\\'s opposition to helping Democrats and warned the president that it is time for him to \"engage directly\" with Democrats in Congress on raising the debt limit by themselves. \"Your lieutenants in Congress must understand that you do not want your unified Democratic government to sleepwalk toward an avoidable catastrophe when they have had nearly three months\\' notice to do their job,\" McConnell wrote. \"Bipartisanship is not a light switch that Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer may flip on to borrow money and flip off to spend it,\" he continued. \"We have no list of demands. For two and a half months, we have simply warned that since your party wishes to govern alone, it must handle the debt limit alone as well.\" The party standoff comes in an extremely polarized environment, when lawmakers are also debating passing one of the largest government spending packages in history, Biden\\'s approximately $2 trillion Build Back Better agenda and the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal. Biden reiterated in his remarks that raising the debt limit has \"nothing to do with my plan for infrastructure or building back better -- zero.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter to his caucus on Monday said a deal must be reached \"by the end of the week,\" an exceedingly ambitious timetable in the partisan environment. \"Let me be clear about the task ahead of us: we must get a bill to the President\\'s desk dealing with the debt limit by the end of the week. Period. We do not have the luxury of waiting until October 18th,\" he wrote. Schumer also threatened to scrap the Senate\\'s recess next week if the GOP doesn\\'t help them rase the debt limit. Currently, the federal debt is at $28.43 trillion, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation\\'s tracker. The current debt ceiling is actually $28.4 trillion -- underscoring the pressure Yellen is under to continue paying the bills through \"extraordinary measures.\"\\nThe fatal injury took place while the car was parked outside a home. A girl has died after she was playing in a parked car and the power window rolled up on her, Phoenix, Arizona, police said. The fatal injury took place Saturday evening while the girl was playing in the car, which was parked at a home, police said. She was taken to a hospital in critical condition and was later pronounced dead, police said. There were no obvious signs of foul play, police said. Her age has not been released.\\nFacebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are back. The apps, owned by Facebook, stopped working Monday for millions of users across the U.S., according to outage site Down Detector. Both the mobile and web browser editions of the apps were not working as of 11:42 a.m. ET, the site reported. They were down for more than six hours. \"To the huge community of people and businesses around the world who depend on us: we\\'re sorry. We\\'ve been working hard to restore access to our apps and services and are happy to report they are coming back online now. Thank you for bearing with us,\" Facebook said Monday evening, once the apps began working again. Later on Monday, the company explained why the outage occurred. \"Our engineering teams have learned that configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers caused issues that interrupted this communication. This disruption to network traffic had a cascading effect on the way our data centers communicate, bringing our services to a halt,\" Facebook said in a statement. Despite the many theories that have been circling the internet since the outage, Facebook said it has no evidence that any user data was compromised during the disruption. \"Our services are now back online and we\\'re actively working to fully return them to regular operations. We want to make clear at this time we believe the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change. We also have no evidence that user data was compromised as a result of this downtime,\" they said. On Monday afternoon, when the outage was first reported, a Facebook company spokesperson told ABC News, \"We\\'re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We\\'re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.\" The company added that it was experiencing \"networking issues\" and gave no timeline for a fix. \"Sincere apologies to everyone impacted by outages of Facebook-powered services right now,\" Facebook said at the time. \"We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible\" The Instagram and Facebook outages come shortly after a whistleblower came forward and claimed to CBS News that the company could do more to protect against hate speech and misinformation but prioritizes profits over its users. Following the Sunday \"60 Minutes\" interview with the whistleblower, identified as Frances Haugen, a data scientist, the company put out a statement defending itself. \"We\\'ve invested heavily in people and technology to keep our platform safe, and have made fighting misinformation and providing authoritative information a priority,\" the company said in a statement. \"If any research had identified an exact solution to these complex challenges, the tech industry, governments, and society would have solved them a long time ago.\" After the whistleblower\\'s identity was made public, Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., announced the Senate will hold a hearing in the Senate Consumer Protection Subcommittee Tuesday to hear from Haugen about Facebook and Instagram\\'s impacts on young users. Facebook\\'s stock took a severe hit Monday following the whistleblower\\'s revelations and the outage, recording its worst day of the year. At closing, the stock was trading at $326.23 a share, down 16.78 points or 4.89%. The situation promoted other social media sites to make some fun jokes. Twitter\\'s official account tweeted, \"Hello literally everyone,\" Monday afternoon. The tweet prompted several funny replies from other major accounts, including McDonald\\'s, Burger King, and Starbucks, which tweeted, \"Perfect time for a coffee break.\" Twitter users later on Monday reported some issues with the app due to an increase in users, but Twitter\\'s support page said the matter was fixed. \"Sometimes more people than usual use Twitter. We prepare for these moments, but today things didn\\'t go exactly as planned. Some of you may have had an issue seeing replies and DMs as a result. This has been fixed. Sorry about that!\" Twitter Support tweeted. On Monday afternoon, the Facebook status page came back online with a message for users. \"Major disruptions: Platform Status,\" it read. \"We are aware that there is an ongoing issue impacting our service. Our engineers are working on it. Sorry for the inconvenience.\" Facebook\\'s safety head was questioned by lawmakers last Thursday over what the company knew about the potential for Instagram to be harmful to young users\\' mental health. The Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Data Security convened the hearing in the wake of a Wall Street Journal investigation citing Facebook\\'s own internal research, allegedly leaked by a whistleblower, that found Instagram adversely impacted mental health issues in teens, especially girls. \"We\\'re here today because Facebook has shown us once again that it is incapable of holding itself accountable,\" Blumenthal said in his opening remarks last week. Facebook defended itself against the bipartisan scrutiny at the hearing. \"We understand that recent reporting has raised a lot of questions about our internal research, including research we do to better understand young people\\'s experiences on Instagram,\" Antigone Davis, Facebook\\'s global head of safety, stated in written testimony. \"We strongly disagree with how this reporting characterized our work, so we want to be clear about what that research shows, and what it does not show.\" The new, upcoming committee hearing, titled \"Protecting Kids Online: Testimony from a Facebook Whistleblower,\" is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday. ABC News\\' Victor Ordonez contributed to this report.\\nBut $2 trillion is \"no\" for the social policy package, he added. In order for the bipartisan infrastructure bill and larger social spending package to pass, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Sunday the $3.5 trillion budget resolution price tag will likely be lowered. \"Three and a half trillion should be a minimum, but I accept that there\\'s gonna have to be a give and take,\" Sanders told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. House progressives have warned leadership they will not vote on President Joe Bidens bipartisan infrastructure bill until the larger human infrastructure bill is also ready for a vote. The budget resolution calls for investments in climate change policy, child care and other social programs, and is wider in scope than the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which includes measures to improve the nations physical infrastructure. \"Both these bills are going forward in tandem,\" Sanders said, reiterating the progressive call to hold out on passing infrastructure until the social spending bill is also passed. Moderate Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., have said they will not support the bills $3.5 trillion price tag. Due to the slim Democratic majority in the Senate, neither bill will pass unless they have all the votes of the Democrats. Sinema released a statement Saturday accusing progressives of \"an ineffective stunt\" and slammed House Democratic leadership for failing to pass the bipartisan infrastructure deal. \"Denying Americans millions of good-paying jobs, safer roads, cleaner water, more reliable electricity and better broadband only hurts everyday families,\" Sinema wrote. Asked by Karl to respond to her statement, Sanders said he thinks Sinema is \"wrong\" and said both bills must go forward together, adding that he voted for the infrastructure bill. \"We\\'re not just taking on or dealing with Sen. Manchin and Sen. Sinema, we\\'re taking on the entire ruling class of the country,\" Sanders responded. \"Right now the drug companies, the health insurance companies, the fossil fuel industry are spending hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars to prevent us from doing what the American people want.\" \"This really is a test on whether democracy can work,\" Sanders said. \"I hope very much and I expect that the Democratic caucus and the president -- I know he will -- stand firm.\" Biden spent last week negotiating with members and visited Capitol Hill on Friday to meet with House Democrats. According to sources in the room for the meeting, the president suggested lowering the price tag for his social policy bill to a number ranging from $1.9 to $2.2 trillion to reach a compromise. Sanders said hes not sure it is \"accurate\" to say Biden would settle on a reconciliation package around $2 trillion. \"The president also said that a smaller investment could create historic achievements, but [for] you, $2 trillion is not enough?\" Karl pressed. \"What the president is saying is that what we are trying to do is for the working families of this country, for the children, for the elderly, we\\'re trying to pass the most consequential piece of legislation since the Great Depression, and hes right,\" Sanders responded. Sanders also said \"no\" when asked by Karl if a $2 trillion price tag for the larger bill would be enough. Manchin has said he will not vote to go over $2 trillion on the reconciliation bill. Asked how they can proceed without his vote, Sanders said the bill is paid for by increasing taxes on \"the wealthiest people not paying federal taxes.\" \"If Manchin wants to pay for it, Im there, let\\'s do it, and by the way, you could pay for it at $3.5 trillion, you can pay for it at $6 trillion,\" Sanders said. \"We have massive income and wealth inequality in this country.\" Democratic Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe has called the $3.5 trillion price tag too high. Pressed on whether the Democratic infighting will not only hurt Democrats in the midterms, but also hurt McAuliffe in his November race, Sanders said he \"wishes Terry McAuliffe the best of luck\" and emphasized the popularity of the reconciliation bill. \"What we are fighting for is precisely what the American people want,\" Sanders said. Sanders emphasized his confidence in passing both bills. \"At the end of the day, I am absolutely convinced we\\'re going to have a strong infrastructure bill, and we\\'re going to have a great consequential reconciliation bill which addresses the needs of the American people,\" Sanders said.\\nMost people in the U.S. want to see Afghans who worked with Americans in the Afghanistan war offered refuge in the United States WASHINGTON -- Most people in the U.S. want to see Afghans who worked with Americans offered resettlement in the United States, a new poll shows, confirming support across political divides for former military translators and others struggling to escape Taliban rule. The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds 72% of Americans say they favor the U.S. granting refugee status to people who worked with the U.S. or Afghan governments during the war in Afghanistan, if they pass security checks. For officials of refugee resettlement groups, veterans and others working to get Afghan allies on planes out of Afghanistan, the poll findings bear out what they are seeing on the ground: Large numbers of Americans regard giving the Afghans a refuge from any Taliban retaliation as a duty and a necessary coda of the nearly 20-year war. Patrick Raglow, a local Catholic Charities executive director in Oklahoma City preparing for at least 1,800 Afghan refugees in the state, said he is fielding hundreds of community offers of help and support for the Afghan immigrants. Oklahoma farmers and ranchers have even volunteered to donate a few acres for the Afghan families to homestead, Raglow said. \"I see this very much as a continuation of the mission of those brave 13 Americans who gave their lives, protecting and sheltering and bringing to safety these very people,\" Raglow said of the resettlement, invoking the U.S. service members killed when a suicide bomber targeted the U.S.-run evacuation at Kabuls airport on Aug. 26, an attack that also killed 169 Afghans. \"It is a way to continue that mission.\" Matt Zeller, an Afghanistan war veteran and founder of the veterans group No One Left Behind, said he has also seen widespread support for Afghan refugees. \"I dont think theres any more unified issue that the American public has had since 9/11,\" said Zeller, whose group is part of a civil society effort encompassing veterans, liberal suburbanites and hardcore conservatives, Democratic and Republican lawmakers and others that has mobilized to get more at-risk Afghans out of the Taliban-held country. Zeller and others are frustrated that U.S. airlifts and subsequent private flights -- handicapped by the Taliban and by U.S. bureaucracy -- have evacuated only a fraction of the thousands of Afghans potentially eligible for special immigrant visas. In a time of sharp political divide, about three-quarters of both Republicans and Democrats support granting refugee status to Afghans who worked with the U.S. or Afghan governments. Overall, just 9% of Americans say they are opposed. \"We owe it to them,\" said Andrew Davis, a 62-year-old Republican and Army veteran in Galloway, Ohio. \"Itd be dangerous for them to stay there, I think, if they helped us.\" More favor than oppose the U.S. taking in other Afghans if they pass security checks, the survey showed. Still, fewer than half, 42%, support that category of refugees, while 26% are opposed. An additional 31% say they\\'re neither in favor nor opposed. More Democrats than Republicans support refugee status for others who fear living in the Taliban-ruled country, 57% to 27%. Twenty percent of Democrats are opposed, while 23% are neither in favor nor opposed. Among Republicans, 38% are opposed and 35% hold neither opinion. Davis said he supported accepting former Afghan employees of the U.S. or Afghan governments and was open to doing the same for other Afghans who felt in danger from the Taliban. But he stressed the importance of security vetting for all Afghan refugees to screen out any security risks. \"If we can do that ... I do think we should take them in,\" he said. \"I mean, theyre obviously at threat.\" Bill Cronin, a 74-year-old retiree and Republican in the San Francisco Bay area, said he supported helping Afghan interpreters and others who went out of their way to aid American service members and civilians. While he spoke with dismay of immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border, he made clear he put former Afghan colleagues of Americans in a special category. \"Those people stuck their neck out knowing, or maybe not knowing, that they could be killed by the Taliban,\" Cronin said. \"So why would you not want to take care of those people?\" Lauren Schulman, a 63-year-old bookstore worker and Democrat in Florida who said she strongly approves of granting the special immigrant visas, said the knowledge that only a small number of desperate Afghan allies has escaped Taliban rule so far makes their plight all the more compelling. Americans have \"been watching them for days and weeks now -- trying to get out,\" Schulman said. ------ The AP-NORC poll of 1,099 adults was conducted Sept. 23-27 using a sample drawn from NORCs probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

The death of Ta\\'Niyla Parker has sparked widespread outrage in Milwaukee and community activists have taken to the streets holding signs reading, \"Stop killing our children.\" \"She was very smart, outgoing. She was a loving big sister to her little sister,\" Ta\\'Niyla\\'s grandmother, Janice Little, told ABC News on Monday. Little said she was Ta\\'Niyla\\'s legal guardian and that the child has lived with her since she was born. \"I hope they get caught and get arrested,\" Little said of her granddaughter\\'s killer. The shooting unfolded about 9 p.m. on Saturday in the Sherman Park neighborhood in northwest Milwaukee, according to the Milwaukee Police Department. A vehicle pulled up alongside the family\\'s car and gunfire erupted, police said. Sherman Park resident Kristofer Koneazny told ABC affiliate station WISN in Milwaukee that he called 911 after hearing around 15 gunshots in rapid succession. No arrests have been made in the homicide and police are still working to identify the person or persons responsible for the shooting, authorities said. Police said a relative was driving the car and took the wounded children to the District 7 police precinct several blocks away, where officers performed first aid and called Milwaukee Fire Department paramedics. The sisters were taken to Children\\'s Hospital in Milwaukee, where the older child died early Sunday morning, police said. Little said her daughter, Talea Hairston, was driving the girls to her home when the shooting occurred. She said Hairston had taken her daughters to a friend\\'s birthday party at a Chuck E. Cheese in Milwaukee. \"She called about 9 oclock. Im thinking shes calling to say, \\'Come open up the door because Im fixing to drop the kids off,\\'\" Little said. \"But she just called and started hollering and screaming and said, \\'The babies were shot.\\'\" She said her younger grandchild suffered non-life-threatening injuries. \"Shes doing better. Shes walking now and they said that she would probably be able to come home today,\" Little said. She said Ta\\'Niyla was a sixth-grader and loved drawing cartoons on her cellphone. \"She loved her anime,\" Little said, referring to a Japanese style of cartoons. \"She was doing all of that on her phone. She loved to do that.\" Community activists in the Sherman Park neighborhood took to the streets Sunday afternoon to draw attention to the tragedy. \"I\\'m a father myself and seeing what happened ... the senseless act of violence where a little kid has to die, I think enough is enough,\" Walter Garron of the Brown Berets community social justice group, told WISN. Garron was one of several community activists holding signs reading \"Stop killing our children.\" \"We\\'re trying to bring awareness make sure people know there are other people here watching,\" Garron said, \"and we are caring about their families and the community and we want this stopped.\"\\nInvestigators say a former driver in NASCARs lower divisions has been killed in a shooting in Georgia that also wounded a woman ATHENS, Ga. -- A former NASCAR driver was killed Saturday in a shooting in Georgia that also wounded a woman, investigators said. John Wes Townley, 31, died in the shooting in a neighborhood around 9 p.m., Athens-Clarke County Coroner Sonny Wilson told the Athens Banner-Herald. A 30-year-old woman was hurt, but police didn\\'t give details about her injuries. Police have spoken to the shooter, who knew the victims. The shooting appeared to be domestic violence related, Athens-Clarke County Police Lt. Shaun Barnett said. No charges have been filed and the investigation continues, Barnett said. Townley raced eight seasons and made 186 starts across the NASCAR Xfinity and Truck Series, NASCAR\\'s lower two national divisions. His victory in the Truck Series at Las Vegas six years ago Sunday was the only national series win of his career. Townley drove a car owned by his father, who was a co-founder of the vehicle\\'s primary sponsor, restaurant chain Zaxbys. ------ More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports\\nOne Drug Enforcement Administration agent was killed and two other officers were injured in a shooting on an Amtrak train that was stopped in Tucson, Arizona, authorities said. Agents boarded the train Monday morning to perform a routine check for illegal guns, money and drugs, after receiving a tip from Amtrak. Prior to boarding, they were given a list of names of the passengers on board -- two of whom were the suspects, Devonte Okeith Mathis and D.T., according to a criminal complaint against Mathis. Once on the train, officers encountered Mathis and D.T. on the second level of the double-decker Amtrak car, Tucson police said. The federal complaint filed Tuesday by FBI Special Agent David Neill states that an agent spotted Mathis and D.T. sitting in the same row, but on opposite sides of the aisle. The agent saw Mathis grab a blue backpack, a black drawstring bag and white plastic bag, and move them three or four rows away before returning to his seat. The agent asked Mathis if the bags were his, which he denied, the complaint says. The agent then removed the bags from the train to inspect them and found what he believed to be two packages of bulk marijuana. The complaint states that agents then spoke to D.T. outside the train and \"conducted a consensual K-0 sniff of several bags on the platform\" of the Amtrak station, but at some point D.T. got back on the train. Once agents located the bulk marijuana in the bags, they tried to recontact D.T. on the upper level of the train. While attempting to contact D.T., DEA Group Supervisor Michael Garbo was shot and killed, the complaint says. Another agent and an officer were injured and taken to the hospital. \"Immediately upon shots being fired, law enforcement officers detained Mathis,\" the complaint says. \"Additional law enforcement officers, including the TDP responded to the scene, and D.T. was subsequently shot and killed after firing a weapon at additional officers.\" Garbo joined DEA in 2005 and \"served honorably for more than 16 years as a Special Agent and Group Supervisor combatting criminal drug traffickers from the Nogales corridor to Kabul, Afghanistan,\" DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a statement. \"Group Supervisor Garbo\\'s operational expertise, mentorship, and leadership were legendary in the Tucson community,\" Milgram said. \"Across DEA, Group Supervisor Garbo was universally loved and respected for his leadership, and for his unrelenting passion to protect the safety of the American people. Above all else, he was a devoted and loving father and husband. DEA mourns the loss of our beloved colleague.\" Another DEA special agent who suffered multiple gunshot wounds during the incident is in stable condition, DEA said Tuesday. A Tucson police officer who was on the platform heard the gunfire and ran onto the train, at which point he was shot, police said. That officer is also in stable condition, police said. A search warrant of the various bags taken from the suspects revealed 2.39 kilograms of raw marijuana, 50 packages of Gooberz (marijuana edibles) and other marijuana and cannabis products. \"The FBI reviewed the video surveillance, body camera footage and spoke with agents and TFOs from the DEA and Tucson Police Department,\" the complaint says. There were no reports of injuries to the 137 passengers or 11 crew members, Amtrak said. The train was en route from Los Angeles to New Orleans and arrived in Tucson at 7:40 a.m. local time, Amtrak said.

Investigators allege a maintenance man at her apartment complex is the \"prime suspect\" in her disappearance. Family members are accusing the management of Arden Villas apartments where Marcano lived and worked of negligence for allowing Armando Caballero, 27, a maintenance man at the complex, to possess a master key fob that allowed him to access Marcano\\'s unit on the day she vanished. They claimed that several residents had complained of Caballero, who investigators said was found dead from suicide. Marcano had told family members that Caballero made romantic advances toward her and she rebuffed him. \"You shouldn\\'t feel unsafe where you live,\" Marcano\\'s cousin, Caili Sue, said during a news conference on Sunday in the parking lot of the Arden Villas apartments. The family\\'s lawyer, Daryl K. Washington, said Marcano\\'s relatives are concerned that other residents of the apartment complex are in jeopardy due to what they describe as lapses in security. \"Death is something that is very difficult. But what makes death even more difficult is when it\\'s death that could have been prevented,\" Washington said. A body believed to be Marcano, a student at Valencia College in Orlando, was discovered around 10:45 a.m. on Saturday in a wooded area near the Tymber Skan apartment complex in Orlando, about 17 miles from where she lived. Orange County Sheriff John Mina said investigators were led to the area based on Caballero\\'s cellphone records. Mina said the records showed Caballero was near the Tymber Skan apartments around 8 or 9 p.m. on Sept. 25, the day Marcano went missing. He said Marcano\\'s purse containing her identification was found near the body. While the Orange County medical examiner has yet to positively identify the remains as those of Marcano, Mina said investigators are \"very certain\" it\\'s her. A key fob Caballero had to access apartments was used at Marcano\\'s unit just before her disappearance, authorities said. Following her disappearance, Marcano\\'s relatives said they found her usually tidy apartment a mess and that there were signs of a struggle. Mina said police served a search warrant on Caballero\\'s apartment and vehicle within 24 hours of Marcano\\'s family reporting her missing. Police found Caballero dead in his apartment on Sept. 27 from an apparent suicide. Washington said tenants of the Arden Villas apartment complex that he and family members spoke to expressed concern over alleged inappropriate behavior by Caballero. But the management of the Arden Villas complex said in a statement that it had received no complaints about Caballero \"from any parties involved directly or indirectly with the situation.\" \"The only way he was able to get access to (Marcano\\'s) apartment without permission was with the key fob. There need to be changes. We\\'re going to make sure another young girl doesn\\'t have to deal with what Miya had to deal with,\" Washington said. \"We feel had this apartment complex taken the proper steps, this person should not have even been employed at the complex.\" In its statement, the management of Arden Villas apartments said \"all employees are vetted using a national background check service\" and that Cabellero had \"no record of burglary or sexual assault.\" The apartment complex, according to the statement from management, plans to beef up security, including posting a guard at the front gate. \"Additionally, we have upgraded our maintenance procedures to allow for appointment-only bookings,\" the statement reads. \"We are in the process of reviewing our entire security apparatus and will make changes or upgrades as warranted.\"\\nAs the U.S. sees its first notable decline in COVID-19 metrics in more than three months, with coronavirus-related hospital admissions and average daily new cases dropping by more than 30% over the last month, Dr. Anthony Fauci says the country is making progress against the current surge, but warned we\\'re not out of the woods yet during an interview on ABC\\'s \"This Week.\" \"We certainly are turning the corner on this particular surge, Jon,\" the nation\\'s top infectious disease expert told \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl on Sunday. \"But we have experienced over now close to 20 months surges that go up and then come down, and then go back up again. The way to keep it down, to make that turnaround continue to go down, is to do what we mentioned: Get people vaccinated.\" \"When you have 70 million people in the country who are eligible to be vaccinated, who are not yet vaccinated, that\\'s the danger zone right there,\" he added. \"So it\\'s within our capability to make sure that that turnaround that were seeing -- that very favorable and optimistic turnaround -- continues to go down and doesn\\'t do what we\\'ve seen multiple times before, where it goes down and then it comes back up.\" Despite the positive signs, the U.S. also marked a grim milestone this week in the pandemic, surpassing 700,000 deaths from COVID-19 on Friday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. \"This is the most formidable virus,\" Fauci said, reflecting on the staggering death toll. \"There are certain elements about this that were just unavoidable, in the sense that there were going to be deaths, there were going to be a lot of infections globally, no matter what anyone did. But there were situations where we could have done better, and we can do better, and I think we\\'re living through that right now,\" Fauci said, again pointing to eligible Americans who have not gotten vaccinated. \"When you say \\'Are some of those deaths avoidable?\\' They certainly are. In fact, looking forward now, most of the deaths could be avoidable if we get people vaccinated,\" he said. One state taking action to increase vaccinations is California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a new requirement for all eligible students in the state to get vaccinated without a testing opt-out. While some parents have expressed their outrage over the move, Fauci argued that the requirements are really nothing new. \"I have been and I still am in favor of these kinds of mandates. You can make some exceptions to them, but in general, people look at this like this is something novel and new, when in fact, throughout, you know, years and years, decades, we have made it a requirement for children to get into schools to get different types of vaccines -- measles, mumps, rubella and others,\" he said. \"So when people treat this as something novel and terrible -- it isn\\'t. A requirement for children to come to school, to be vaccinated with certain vaccines, is not something new. It\\'s been around for a very long time,\" Fauci continued. While increasing vaccinations remain the priority for the Biden administration, Fauci also noted the positive preliminary results of a new antiviral drug from the pharmaceutical company Merck, which showed it could lower the risk for hospitalization or death for someone infected with COVID by 50%. Fauci stressed the drug would \"absolutely not\" be a replacement for getting vaccinated but said the future implementation of the drug held a lot of promise. \"It\\'s a big deal, Jon, I mean you have now a small molecule drug that can be given orally,\" he said, \"and the results of the trial that we just announced yesterday and the day before, are really quite impressive.\"\\nInvestigators said the shooting was not gang related. Investigators arrested a suspect Sunday morning who they say was involved in the shooting of University of Utah football player Aaron Lowe and an unidentified woman. Salt Lake City detectives arrested Buk M. Buk and charged him for Lowe\\'s death during a house party on Sept. 26. Investigators said Buk, 22, who purportedly was an uninvited guest, allegedly took out a pistol and opened fire at Lowe, 21, and the unidentified 20-year-old woman. Lowe, a native of Mesquite, Texas, died at the scene while the woman was transported to the hospital and underwent surgery, police said. She is listed in critical condition as of Sunday, police said. Buk has been charged by police with murder, aggravated murder, and felony discharge of a firearm, according to investigators. Attorney information for the suspect wasn\\'t immediately available. Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown told reporters Sunday that the investigation is still ongoing but reassured the public that the shooting was not gang-related and the school wasn\\'t a direct target. \"Those answers will come through the litigation of this case,\" he said during a news conference. Lowe was in his third season of playing with the University of Utah. He was the first recipient of the Ty Jordan Memorial Scholarship, an award created to honor former the University of Utah player Ty Jordan, who lost his life after an accidental shooting in December 2020, ABC affiliate KTVX reported. The school and student body held memorials last week to honor Lowe. \"We continue to mourn the loss of Aaron, and we miss him dearly. We also remain hopeful for a full recovery for the second victim of the shooting,\" Mark Harlan, the University of Utah director of athletics, said in a statement Sunday. Brown added that he talked with Lowe\\'s mother about the arrest and reiterated that his team would continue to find answers in this \"senseless killing.\" Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall also offered her condolences to Lowe\\'s family. \"My heart grieves for you as the mayor of Salt Lake City and as a mother,\" Mendenhall said at a news conference Sunday. \"No parent should have to bury their child.\"\\nA new report sheds light on how world leaders, powerful politicians, billionaires and others have used offshore accounts to shield assets collectively worth trillions of dollars over the past quarter-century A new report sheds light on how world leaders, powerful politicians, billionaires and others have used offshore accounts to shield assets collectively worth trillions of dollars over the past quarter-century. The report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists involved 600 journalists from 150 media outlets in 117 countries. Its being dubbed the \"Pandora Papers\" because the findings shed light on the previously hidden dealings of the elite and the corrupt. Hundreds of politicians, celebrities, religious leaders and drug dealers have been hiding their investments in mansions, exclusive beachfront property, yachts and other assets, according to a review of nearly 12 million files obtained from 14 firms located around the world. The more than 330 current and former politicians identified as beneficiaries of the secret accounts include Jordans King Abdullah II, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Ecuador\\'s President Guillermo Lasso, and associates of both Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The billionaires called out in the report include Turkish construction mogul Erman Ilicak and Robert T. Brockman, the former CEO of software maker Reynolds & Reynolds. Many of the accounts were designed to evade taxes and conceal assets for other shady reasons, according to the report. \"The new data leak must be a wake-up call,\" said Sven Giegold, a Green party lawmaker in the European Parliament. \"Global tax evasion fuels global inequality. We need to expand and sharpen the countermeasures now.\" Oxfam International, a British consortium of charities, applauded the Pandora Papers for exposing brazen examples of greed that deprived countries of tax revenue that could be used to finance programs and projects for the greater good. \"This is where our missing hospitals are,\" Oxfam said in a statement. \"This is where the pay-packets sit of all the extra teachers and firefighters and public servants we need. Whenever a politician or business leader claims there is \\'no money to pay for climate damage and innovation, for more and better jobs, for a fair post-COVID recovery, for more overseas aid, they know where to look.\" The Pandora Papers are a follow-up to a similar project released in 2016 called the \"Panama Papers\" compiled by the same journalistic group. The latest bombshell is even more expansive, relying on nearly 3 terabytes of data -- the equivalent of roughly 750,000 photos on a smartphone -- leaked from 14 different service providers doing business in 38 different jurisdictions in the world. The records date back to the 1970s, but most of the files span from 1996 to 2020. In contrast, the Panama Papers culled through 2.6 terabytes of data leaked by one now-defunct law firm called Mossack Fonseca that was located in the country that inspired that project\\'s nickname. The latest investigation dug into accounts registered in familiar offshore havens, including the British Virgin Islands, Seychelles, Hong Kong and Belize. But some of the secret accounts were also scattered around in trusts set up in the U.S., including 81 in South Dakota and 37 in Florida. The investigation found advisers helped Abdullah, the king of Jordan, set up at least three dozen shell companies from 1995 to 2017, helping the monarch buy 14 homes worth more than $106 million in the U.S. and the U.K. One was a $23 million California ocean-view property bought in 2017 through a British Virgin Islands company. The advisers were identified as an English accountant in Switzerland and lawyers in the British Virgin Islands. Abdullah denied any impropriety in a comment Monday by the Royal Palace, citing security needs for keeping the transactions quiet and saying no public funds were used. The details are an embarrassing blow to Abdullah, whose government was engulfed in scandal this year when his half brother, former Crown Prince Hamzah, accused the \"ruling system\" of corruption and incompetence. The king claimed he was the victim of a \"malicious plot,\" placed his half brother under house arrest and put two former close aides on trial. U.K attorneys for Abdullah said he isnt required to pay taxes under his countrys law and hasnt misused public funds. The attorneys also said most of the companies and properties are not connected to the king or no longer exist, though they declined to provide details. Blair, U.K. prime minister from 1997 to 2007, became the owner of an $8.8 million Victorian building in 2017 by buying a British Virgin Islands company that held the property, and the building now hosts the law firm of his wife, Cherie Blair, according to the the investigation. The two bought the company from the family of Bahrains industry and tourism minister, Zayed bin Rashid al-Zayani. Buying the company shares instead of the London building saved the Blairs more than $400,000 in property taxes, the investigation found. The Blairs and the al-Zayanis both said they didnt initially know the other party was involved in the deal, the probe found. Cherie Blair said her husband wasnt involved in the purchase, which she said was meant to bring \"the company and the building back into the U.K. tax and regulatory regime.\" She also said she did not want to own a British Virgin Islands company and that the \"seller for their own purposes only wanted to sell the company,\" which is now closed. A lawyer for the al-Zayanis said they complied with U.K. laws. Khan, the Pakistani prime minister, is not accused of any wrongdoing. But members of his inner circle, including Finance Minister Shaukat Fayaz Ahmed Tarin, are accused of hiding millions of dollars in wealth in secret companies or trusts, according to the journalists\\' findings. In a tweet, Khan vowed to recover the \"ill-gotten gains\" and said his government will look into all citizens mentioned in the documents and take action, if needed. The consortium of journalists revealed Putin\\'s image-maker and chief executive of Russia\\'s leading TV station, Konstantin Ernst, got a discount to buy and develop Soviet-era cinemas and surrounding property in Moscow after he directed the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Ernst told the organization the deal wasn\\'t secret and denied suggestions he was given special treatment. In 2009, Babis, the Czech prime minister, put $22 million into shell companies to buy a chateau property in a hilltop village in Mougins, France, near Cannes, the investigation found. The shell companies and the chateau were not disclosed in Babis required asset declarations, according to documents obtained by the journalism groups Czech partner, Investigace.cz. A real estate group owned indirectly by Babis bought the Monaco company that owned the chateau in 2018, the probe found. Babis has denied any wrongdoing. \"I dont own any offshore, I dont own any property in France, and all the money I loaned then I got back,\" he told the Czech public television on Monday. \"Let the police investigate that.\" Babis said the report was meant to harm him ahead of the Czech Republic parliamentary election being held on Friday and Saturday. \"Its nasty, false accusations that are meant to influence the election. Thats all,\" he said. The Czech polices organized crime unit said it would launch an investigation into the report. ------ Liedtke reported from San Ramon, California, and Mattise reported from Nashville, Tennessee.

The shooting was reported at 12:13 a.m. local time at the hospital\\'s Gibbon Building, according to an internal law enforcement briefing reviewed by ABC News. No one else at the hospital was hurt. Philadelphia police said they believe the slain employee -- a 43-year-old male nursing assistant -- was targeted. Police found the suspect outside a school about 4 miles from the hospital at 1:29 a.m. local time, the briefing said. The gunman shot at police, striking two officers, before the suspect was injured and taken into custody, according to law enforcement. One officer, a 30-year-old, was hit in the elbow and the other, a 32-year-old, was struck in the nose, police said. Both officers are expected to survive, police said. The suspect, who was wearing body armor and carrying multiple weapons, was struck by officers in the upper body and the neck, police said. The 55-year-old suspect is expected to survive, police said. Police searched a box truck the suspect was driving and found a gun, scrub pants and body armor, law enforcement said. The hospital said in a statement, \"Our hearts are broken as we stand together to remember our colleague and recognize his teammates who tried to save him and protect other patients in the area. We also value the bravery of our security guards, as well as Philadelphia police who were injured in apprehending the suspect.\" \"We are also very proud of the professionalism and dedication of our colleagues, who despite this tragic incident, continued to carry out their duties taking care of their patients and each other,\" the hospital said. \"We have comprehensive, consistent security measures and processes in place to ensure the safety of our patients, students, staff and visitor,\" the statement said. \"Each Jefferson location has policies, procedures, ongoing training and drills to mitigate safety risks. Jefferson does not permit weapons on any of its campuses. In light of this tragic incident, we are offering counseling support for impacted employees and patients. We will continue to work closely with law enforcement during their investigation.\"\\nFormer President Donald Trump will have to sit for a deposition sometime before Christmas as part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on \"Apprentice,\" a judges law clerk said Monday. Zervos has alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2007 and defamed her during his campaign when he said she lied about it. Earlier, in a 2016 statement, Trump had said that he had \"never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago.\" The two parties are still haggling over disclosure of certain documents but Zervos side is eager to depose the former president. \"We just dont believe our client can be further prejudiced in delaying this litigation any longer,\" said Zervos attorney Moira Penza. \"We do not believe there are any outstanding issues that would prohibit the parties from engaging in depositions.\" An attorney for Trump, Alina Habba, called it \"completely ridiculous\" to think depositions could occur immediately when Zervos has not turned over all relevant information. \"Ms. Zervos is claiming emotional damages and financial damages,\" Habba said. \"How can we, as defense counsel, provide any kind of quality deposition when we dont have all the medical records?\" A law clerk for the judge overseeing the case said he saw no reason depositions could not occur before the end of the year. \"Now hes a private citizen,\" said clerk Michael Rand during a virtual status conference on Monday. \"Im sure like any other litigant, we can have mutually agreeable dates for depositions. I really dont see a reason that before the end of the year, youre not done with depositions.\" Rand set a close-of-fact date by Dec. 23, meaning depositions will have to be taken by then. He said he expected a trial date to be set sometime in the early part of 2022.\\nA Texas man who joined the mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 has been sentenced to 45 days behind bars A Texas man who joined the mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan 6. was sentenced Monday to 45 days behind bars even though prosecutors weren\\'t seeking jail time, after the judge blasted comparisons between the riot that day and the Black Lives Matter protests over racial injustice. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan called it a false equivalence \"to compare the actions of people protesting, mostly peacefully, for civil rights\" to the mob that \"was trying to overthrow the government.\" She said doing so \"ignores the very real danger that the Jan. 6 riots pose to the foundation of our democracy.\" The judge\\'s remarks in the case against Matthew Mazzocco of San Antonio came days after another judge in Washington\\'s federal court suggested that the Justice Department was being too hard on the Jan. 6 defendants when compared to the people arrested during the protests after George Floyd\\'s murder. Judge Trevor McFadden, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, questioned Friday why federal prosecutors had not brought more cases against those who had taken part in the 2020 summertime protests and said the Justice Department \"would have more credibility if it was even-handed in its concern about riots and mobs in this city.\" He sentenced Danielle Doyle of Oklahoma to probation even though prosecutors had recommended two months of home confinement. Chutkan, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, said she \"flatly\" disagreed with the suggestion raised by \"some people\" that the Jan. 6 defendants were being treated unfairly. In fact, she said she believes those who joined the pro-Trump mob were being treated more leniently than many other defendants. She noted the vast majority of rioters were not arrested on Jan. 6 but were allowed to return home and that many defendants, like Mazzocco, were charged only with misdemeanors despite what she called the \"premeditated decision to come to the District to try to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\" Some Jan. 6 defendants and their Republican allies have claimed that the Justice Department has treated the Capitol rioters harshly because of their political views, while those who caused violence in the wake of Floyd\\'s killing were given leniency. But an Associated Press analysis of court documents in more than 300 federal cases stemming from the racial injustice protests showed that dozens of people have been convicted of serious crimes and sent to prison. Prosecutors had been seeking three months of home confinement for Mazzocco, who pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor charge of demonstrating in the Capitol. Mazzocco spent 12 minutes inside the building and posted a selfie on Facebook after the riot with the caption: \"the capital is ours!\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Kimberley Nielsen noted that he was among the first 10 Jan. 6 defendants to accept responsibility for his actions. In a letter Mazzocco\\'s attorney read to the judge, he called his decision to enter the Capitol \"one of the most foolish and impulsive decisions\" of his life. He told the judge his actions have taken a massive toll on him and that he has received \"countless death threats.\" \"Since that day, Ive lived with the feeling of shame, sorrow and remorse, not because Im going through legal troubles, but because Im seeing the country I love so dearly divided like never before,\" Mazzocco wrote. The judge said Mazzocco\\'s participation in the riot warrants time behind bars even though he didn\\'t steal or destroy anything or hurt anyone at the Capitol. She said that \"the rioters who committed violence that day did so because they had the safety of numbers,\" thanks to those like Mazzocco. \"Mr. Mazzocco did not go to the United States Capitol out of any love or support for our country, he went there to support one man who he viewed had the election taken from him,\" she said. About 90 Jan. 6 defendants have pleaded guilty, mostly to low level misdemeanor charges, but only a handful have received their punishments so far. Two other defendants, who pleaded guilty to a different misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct, were also sentenced last week to 45 days behind bars.\\nStephanie Grisham, one of former President Donald Trump\\'s most senior and longest-serving advisers, says she is \"terrified\" that her former boss may run for office again. \"I am terrified of him running in 2024,\" Grisham, who served as both Trump\\'s press secretary and first lady Melania Trump\\'s chief of staff, told \"Nightline\" co-anchor Juju Chang in a wide-ranging exclusive interview on the eve of the publication of Grisham\\'s new book. \"I don\\'t think he is fit for the job,\" Grisham said. \"I think that he is erratic. I think that he can be delusional. I think that he is a narcissist and cares about himself first and foremost. And I do not want him to be our president again.\" Asked by Chang what scares her the most, Grisham painted a grim picture of what could happen if Trump ends up running again in 2024. \"I think he would foment more violence,\" she said. \"He won\\'t have consequences. He won\\'t need to be reelected again.\" \"I think he will line his pockets,\" she added. \"I think his family will line their pockets. I believe that he wanted to help the country in the beginning; I believe he wants to help himself now.\" In her new book, titled \"I\\'ll Take Your Questions Now,\" out this Tuesday, Grisham describes a White House in perpetual chaos, where she says \"casual dishonesty\" flowed through the air \"as if it were in the air conditioning system.\" The book is filled with accusations about the former president, and includes a host of alleged wrongdoings that range from downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus to making sexual comments about a young female White House staffer. But amid all the turmoil laid out in the book, Grisham remained by the former president\\'s side for nearly his entire four-year term in the White House, before resigning after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. \"How did you go from one of the loyalist loyals to one of their fiercest critics, seemingly overnight?\" Chang asked Grisham, who responded, \"Definitely not overnight. It\\'s kind of a journey.\" Grisham, who is perhaps best known for never holding a televised press briefing during her time as White House press secretary, has faced a barrage of criticism for speaking out now, nearly a year after leaving the White House. The former president and his family have forcefully responded to the latest tell-all book by a former close ally, with Melania Trump\\'s office saying in a statement, \"The author is desperately trying to rehabilitate her tarnished reputation by manipulating and distorting the truth about Mrs. Trump. Ms. Grisham is a deceitful and troubled individual who doesn\\'t deserve anyone\\'s trust. \"Stephanie didnt have what it takes and that was obvious from the beginning,\" former President Trump said in a statement. \"Now, like everyone else, she gets paid by a radical left-leaning publisher to say bad and untrue things.\" Grisham has also received harsh pushback from some former colleagues, including former Trump White House Director of Communications Alyssa Farah, who responded to the book live during her guest-host appearance on \"The View\" Monday. \"First and foremost, I don\\'t believe in profiting off of public service. I had a chance to write my White House tell-all and declined. The American people, the taxpayers, paid my salary. I\\'m not going to go write a book and cash in,\" said Farah, who resigned from the White House in December following the election. \"Reading some of the reviews, some of the critics are saying, you know, if you\\'re admitting to lying then, what makes us think that you\\'re not lying now?\" Chang asked Grisham about her role as press secretary. \"Well, I don\\'t think I\\'m admitting to lying at all,\" Grisham responded. \"I tried to give the press the most honest answers I could, and there were oftentimes I was given information that I knew to be true that perhaps wasn\\'t true.\" But Chang pushed back, pointing out that Grisham had already admitted that a 2019 tweet she posted targeting former Chief of Staff John Kelly had been untrue. \"To be fair, you did say that the John Kelly tweet was not sincere,\" Chang said to Grisham, who acknowledged, \"That was not sincere,\" and added, \"And I regret and apologize for so much.\" \"But you said that, \\'I never lied?\\'\" Chang followed up. \"Oh no,\" Grisham said. \"I would s-- I-- I just would say I-- I tried my best.\" Beyond not holding a press briefing, Grisham writes in the book that she was once tasked by the former president with figuring out how to completely ban members of the media from the White House grounds. \"I researched different places we could put them other than the press briefing room. Each time the president asked me about my progress on the matter, I let him know I was still working on options,\" she writes. \"Should the American public believe what you\\'re saying now when you, in many ways, were nonresponsive and not communicating transparently or honestly during -- by your own admission?\" Chang asked. \"Fair question -- the fact is, the president never wanted me to do a briefing,\" said Grisham who added that \"I was glad that that was something he didn\\'t want from me, because I didn\\'t want to have to go out there and say something dishonest.\" Farah, however, pushed back on Grisham\\'s claim that Trump told her not to hold press briefings. \"That would surprise me,\" Farah said. \"When I worked for him, it was, \\'Go get out on TV, Alyssa. Kayleigh, go give a briefing.\\' He wanted people out.\" \"She could have done backgrounders in her office,\" Farah said of Grisham. \"But it seemed like she was largely MIA on the job.\" Grisham also claims in the book that she observed the former president, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least 18 women, develop an \"unusual interest\" and behave \"inappropriately\" toward a young female staffer during his time as president, including during one trip where he summoned the unnamed aide to his cabin on Air Force One, allegedly telling other staffers, \"Let\\'s bring her up here and look at her ass.\" \"What I do know is that he behaved inappropriately. And since the woman worked for me, I tried to protect her and keep his unusual interest in her under wraps,\" Grisham writes. \"If the president didn\\'t see her with the press corps, he would ask me where she was. He would ask me if she were coming with us on foreign trips. When she did come along on trips, he often asked me to bring her to his office cabin in the aircraft, which he\\'d rarely done with anyone else.\" \"I wouldn\\'t leave her in the cabin with him. I always sat there,\" Grisham told Chang. \"And he would just talk to her about, you know, \\'Did you see my speech? What did you think?\\' You know, I think have her compliment him.\" But Chang challenged Grisham, asking, \"And yet in many ways were you helping in some ways normalizing his other inappropriate behavior and enabling in some way this behavior?\" \"I\\'ve thought about that a lot,\" Grisham replied. \"At the White House, it\\'s not like there\\'s a human resources office that you can go to say, \\'Hey, the president of the United States is acting inappropriately.\\'\" Grisham\\'s claims about the staffer were corroborated by Farah, who said on \"The View\" that \"I was aware of the situation and of the female and I did report it to the chief of staff.\" \"It was a challenging situation I don\\'t know if anything was done,\" she said. \"What were you worried that might happen?\" Chang asked Grisham. \"I was worried that a young, impressionable girl would be put into a situation that made her uncomfortable,\" said Grisham, who also admitted that she now believes \"most\" of the women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, including former porn star Stormy Daniels. \"I was worried he would sexually harass her.\" As the first lady\\'s chief of staff, Grisham had an up-close look at the woman she says Secret Service agents referred to as \"Rapunzel.\" Regarding the #FreeMelania hashtag that became a rallying cry for those who theorized online that the first lady didn\\'t want to be in the White House, Grisham said that idea was misguided. \"The #FreeMelania hashtag I think was people hoping that she wanted to leave,\" Grisham said. \"The truth is, she liked it there. I think there was a rumor for years that she had a whole separate house somewhere, which was not true. We would laugh about the #FreeMelania hashtag all the time.\" Grisham also described what it was like to be the person to inform the first lady that her husband was being accused of an extramarital affair and was being sued by Daniels. \"That was tough. As a woman, I\\'ve been cheated on before, so that was painful for me,\" Grisham recalled. \"It was very, very awkward. I\\'ve never had to do anything like that before.\" Grisham also claimed that staffers had a secret nickname for the president\\'s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who both held senior positions in the White House, referring to the pair as \"the interns.\" \"We called them the interns because as interns usually are, they come into places and think they know everything,\" Grisham said. In the book, which publisher HarperCollins calls \"the most frank and intimate portrait of the Trump White House yet,\" Grisham also claims Trump had an infatuation with dictators and writes how the former president allegedly sought to cozy up to Russia\\'s Vladimir Putin during an overseas trip for the Group of 20 summit in Osaka in 2019. Grisham alleges that during a private meeting before the press was brought into the room, Trump told Putin, \"Okay, I\\'m going to act a little tougher with you for a few minutes. But it\\'s for the cameras, and after they leave we\\'ll talk. You understand.\" \"Putin was coughing. He kept coughing, kept clearing his throat, and I did find it odd that he wouldn\\'t just take a drink of water ... and he knows ways to get in someone\\'s head,\" Grisham told Chang. As one of Trump\\'s longest-serving political aides, Grisham\\'s time working for the former president dates back to his 2016 campaign when she served as a press wrangler before moving deeper into the Trumps\\' inner circle. As other top aides resigned or were forced out -- with some even speaking out against Trump while he was still in office -- Grisham continued to stand by the president. Grisham told Chang that one of her biggest regrets was not doing more from inside the White House during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when, as she alleges, Trump was thinking more about getting reelected than how to get the virus under control. \"It was about having him look presidential for reelection. I wish I would have told him he needs to wear a mask. I wish I could\\'ve been louder with that,\" she said. \"Do you think that misinformation or dishonesty cost lives?\" Chang asked about the White House\\'s response to the pandemic. \"Yes,\" Grisham replied. \"I will always think that, and I don\\'t know that I -- you can ever forgive yourself fully for being a part of that.\"\\nSinema said it was \"no legitimate protest\" and \"wholly inappropriate.\" Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat, is clapping back after she was videotaped and chased into a school bathroom over the weekend by a group of pro-Biden agenda activists, confronting her over her objections holding up Democratic efforts on Capitol Hill. President Joe Biden also weighed in on the encounter, when asked on Monday, calling it not appropriate but also \"part of the process\" for someone without Secret Service protection. Sinema, in an earlier statement on Monday, called the display caught on video and posted online \"no legitimate protest\" and \"wholly inappropriate.\" She claimed activists entered Arizona State University, where she was teaching, using \"deceptive\" and \"unlawful\" means. \"After deceptively entering a locked, secure building, these individuals filmed and publicly posted videos of my students without their permission -- including footage taken of both my students and I using a restroom,\" the statement said. While she wrote she supports the First Amendment, she shunned the protest -- by a group she doesn\\'t name but claims to have met with several times since she was elected to the Senate. \"Yesterday\\'s behavior was not legitimate protest. It is unacceptable for activist organizations to instruct their members to jeopardize themselves by engaging in unlawful activities such as gaining entry to closed university buildings, disrupting learning environments, and filming students in a restroom,\" she wrote. Video posted to Twitter on Sunday by the organization Living United for Change in Arizona or LUCHA, showed people chanting at and chasing the first-term senator into a bathroom, pressing her to support Biden\\'s Build Back Better agenda and progressive immigration policy. LUCHA co-directors Tomas Robles and Alejandra Gomez said in a statement to ABC News that Sinema has shown \"zero interest to engage with her constituents or meet her colleagues halfway on critical legislation.\" \"Sinema\\'s constituents have not been granted access to her office, they have been ignored, dismissed, and antagonized,\" they said in an email on behalf of the organization. \"We will continue to do the appropriate thing: listen to people across Arizona about what they need to thrive, meet our community where they are, fiercely advocate on their behalf, and meet the moment!\" The confrontation comes as the moderate Democratic senator, along with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., continue intraparty negotiations on the topline number for a larger social spending package to accompany the already Senate-passed $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. \"In the 19 years I have been teaching at ASU, I have been committed to creating a safe and intellectually challenging environment for my students. Yesterday, that environment was breached. My students were unfairly and unlawfully victimized. This is wholly inappropriate,\" Sinema continued. Sinema\\'s statement ended by putting the onus also on elected officials to foster a healthy environment for politics. \"It is the duty of elected leaders to avoid fostering an environment in which honestly-held policy disagreements serve as the basis for vitriol -- raising the temperature in political rhetoric and creating a permission structure for unacceptable behavior,\" she wrote. Biden was asked about the recent protests facing both Sinema and Manchin in his remarks on Monday about the debt ceiling. \"Joe Manchin had people on kayaks show up to his boat to yell at him. Senator Sinema last night was chased into a restroom. Do you think that those tactics are crossing a line?\" a reporter asked. \"I don\\'t think they\\'re appropriate tactics, but it happens to everybody,\" Biden replied. \"The only people it doesn\\'t happen to are people who have Secret Service standing around them. So, it\\'s part of the process.\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki attempted to clarify at a later press briefing that Biden was agreeing with Sinema that free speech is fundamental to democracy but also that the confrontation was \"inappropriate and unacceptable.\" \"The president believes that -- maybe he shorthanded it, but he wanted to make that clear this morning,\" Psaki said. \"The safe and intellectually stimulating environment she\\'s worked to create during the years of teaching at ASU was breached. That\\'s inappropriate and unacceptable, and I think the context of what happened here is important, despite the fact that, of course, we stand for -- the president stands for -- the fundamental right of people to protest,\" she added. She said it was clear the White House condemned the behavior. Biden, asked earlier if Sinema has given the White House a topline number for the social package -- somewhere between $1.5 trillion and $3.5 trillion -- said, \"I\\'m not going to negotiate in public.\" But he did draw an apparent line of us-vs-them when it came to Sinema and Manchin. \"I was able to close the deal on 99% of my party,\" Biden said, on nearly getting his infrastructure and social spending bills across the finish line. \"Two. Two people.\" \"I need 50 votes in the Senate. I have 48,\" he added later. As the video of Sinema went viral on Twitter over the weekend, accumulating more than five million views by Monday, pundits of all parties united in agreement that the behavior crossed a privacy line. ABC News\\' Trish Turner and Ben Gittleson contributed to this report.\\nJustices face one of the most consequential terms in years, analysts say. Facing an onslaught of political pressure tactics and plunging public approval, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sails into a new term set to decide some of the most divisive cases in decades on abortion, gun rights, the death penalty and religious freedom. By the end of June 2022, the court\\'s conservative majority has the potential to roll back 50 years of abortion rights precedent; declare a right to carry a handgun outside the home; bolster the death penalty; and, allow some American parents to use taxpayer funds for religious schools. \"This is not a court that has the opportunity to inch forward and tip toe around issues,\" said University of Chicago law professor and legal historian Farah Peterson. \"We should all be watching these cases very closely because suddenly the court has new members interested in taking up issues of grave public concern.\" The justices are also expected to address challenges to the Biden administration\\'s nationwide vaccine mandate; continuation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, for young immigrants; partisan drawing of congressional districts with new census data; and, Harvard\\'s use of racial affirmative action. The blockbuster docket will play out as public approval of the Supreme Court in Gallup polling hits its lowest point in more than two decades -- 40% in September, down precipitously from a ten-year high of 58% just last year. \"Not since Bush v. Gore has the public perception of the court\\'s legitimacy seemed so seriously threatened,\" said Irv Gornstein, executive director of Georgetown Law\\'s Supreme Court Institute. On the heels of a term marked by moderation and unanimity, most court watchers are braced for a sharp pivot to more polarizing decisions, foreshadowed in part by the justices\\' 5-4 vote this summer to allow Texas to ban nearly all abortions across the state on technical grounds. Taken together with a presidential commission weighing an overhaul of the bench, and mounting pressure on the court\\'s oldest liberal member to retire, veteran legal analysts say it could be one of the most consequential years for the Supreme Court in a generation. \"We\\'re going to have a huge explosion whichever direction they rule,\" said Carrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative legal advocacy group, of the abortion cases. \"Even if they try to rule down the middle and come up with a middle ground, you\\'re going to have outrage from the left or serious concerns from the right.\" Several justices have tacitly acknowledged in recent high-profile speeches and interviews that stubborn public perception of them as a politically-motivated group -- combined with the hot-button decisions on the horizon -- may significantly undermine the court\\'s credibility. The court announced last month that it would continue live-streaming oral arguments to the public at least through the end of the year, continuing an act of transparency prompted by the pandemic but even as the justices return to in-person sessions on Oct. 4. \"We don\\'t trade votes, and members of the court have different judicial philosophies,\" Justice Stephen Breyer said in an interview on \"Good Morning America\" this month. \"The great divisions are probably much more along those lines than what we would think of as political lines.\" Justice Amy Coney Barrett used a joint appearance with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell at the University of Kentucky to reject the notion that the justices are simply politicians in robes. \"To say the court\\'s reasoning is flawed is different from saying the court is acting in a partisan manner,\" Barrett told students. \"I think we need to evaluate what the court is doing on its own terms.\" Justice Clarence Thomas used a speech at the University of Notre Dame to warn critics against \"destroying our institutions because they don\\'t give us what we want, when we want it.\" To many observers, however, the court\\'s opinions remain impossible to view without a political lens. \"If right-side judicial philosophies always produce results favored by Republicans and left-side judicial philosophies always produce results favored by Democrats, there is little chance of persuading the public that there is a difference between the two,\" said Gornstein. Last year, the justices handed down unanimous or near-unanimous decisions in roughly 60% of cases, according to an ABC News analysis. On several hot-button social issues, Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and Barrett joined liberal Justices Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, to forge common ground. \"Barrett, for example, voted with Roberts and Kavanaugh over 90% of the time,\" said FiveThirtyEight contributor Laura Bronner. \"Based on what we know so far she seems like she\\'s going to be a core component of the conservative triad at the center of the court.\" That triad could be the key to just how quickly the court continues its shift to the right and whether it\\'s prepared to set into motion major societal changes on several controversial issues. \"The conditions for the right side running the table have never looked better,\" said Gornstein. \"But I don\\'t think sweeping right-side rulings in all politically salient cases is inevitable.\" The court\\'s coming term will be dominated by the issue of abortion rights, centered on a case out of Mississippi that asks the justices to directly reconsider the landmark precedent in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey. \"Roe v. Wade is on thin ice,\" said Florida State University law professor and abortion law historian Mary Ziegler. \"At the moment it really feels more as if it\\'s a question of when, not if; and how, not whether.\" As Americans snatch up guns at record pace and shooting deaths soar, the justices will also decide a major case out of New York on whether the Second Amendment creates a right to carry a handgun outside the home. \"It would mean that you could expect more people to be carrying handguns in places like New York City, Boston and Los Angeles\" if the court affirms such a right, said Southern Methodist University law professor Eric Ruben. \"One of the things that the justices, especially the \\'institutionalist justices,\\' are going to be considering is ripple effects that could undermine a decade\\'s worth of precedent and the lower courts.\" The court will decide whether to reinstate the death sentence for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhohkar Tsarnaev and whether a Texas man sentenced to death has a First Amendment right to his pastor praying aloud and laying hands on him in the execution chamber. A pair of cases will also test the government\\'s power to keep national security secrets: A former alleged associate of Osama bin Laden detained for decades at Guantanamo Bay is demanding the CIA turn over information on alleged torture at black sites overseas; and, a group of Muslim men in California is seeking to sue the FBI for alleged unlawful surveillance. Analysts say the conservative Supreme Court supermajority is at a crossroads, the cases ahead set to reveal how far and how fast they\\'ll move the court\\'s jurisprudence to the right.\\nJust a couple of months ago, I told yall about some exciting new merchandise in the Disney Artist Series Collection.

The figure includes abuses committed by some 3,000 priests and an unknown number of other people involved in the church -- wrongdoing that Catholic authorities covered up over decades in a \"systemic manner,\" according to the president of the commission that issued the report, Jean-Marc Sauve. The 2,500-page document was issued as the Catholic Church in France, like in other countries, seeks to face up to shameful secrets that were long covered up. Victims welcomed the report as long overdue and the head of the French bishops conference asked for their forgiveness. The report said the tally of 330,000 victims includes an estimated 216,000 people abused by priests and other clerics, and the rest by church figures such as scout leaders or camp counselors. The estimates are based on a broader research by Frances National Institute of Health and Medical Research into sexual abuse of children in the country. The studys authors estimate 80% of the church\\'s victims were boys, while the broader study of sexual abuse found that 75% of the overall victims were girls. The independent commission urged the church to take strong action, denouncing its \"faults\" and \"silence.\" It also called on the Catholic Church to help compensate the victims, notably in cases that are too old to prosecute via French courts. \"We consider the church has a debt towards victims,\" Sauve said. Francois Devaux, head of the victims group La Parole Liberee (The Liberated Word), said it was \"a turning point in our history.\" He denounced the coverups that permitted \"mass crimes for decades.\" \"But even worse, there was a betrayal: betrayal of trust, betrayal of morality, betrayal of children, betrayal of innocence,\" he added. Martine, 73, and Mireille, 71, were sexually assaulted by a priest when they were teenage girls in high school. They both declined to give their last name due to privacy reasons, in part because some family members were not aware of the abuses. \"It brings on such terrible thoughts,\" Martine said. \"For me, personally, I had to wait for my parents to die\" because otherwise she said it was \"not possible\" to speak out. \"I think that each victim experienced it as if they were the only one (victim), and thats part of this phenomenon involving control and secrecy,\" Mireille said. \"We are in a condition of submission ... in a mental captivity. So, we follow this person who suddenly takes power over us ... We are caught in a spider web.\" A recognition of the fault is essential, she said, and financial compensation is \"really symbolic ... it won\\'t fix things but it means it will also cost them something.\" Olivier Savignac, the head of victims association Parler et Revivre (Speak Out and Live Again), contributed to the investigation. He told The Associated Press that the high ratio of victims per abuser was particularly \"terrifying for French society, for the Catholic Church.\" Savignac assailed the church for treating such cases as individual anomalies instead of as a collective horror. He described being abused at age 13 by the director of a Catholic vacation camp in the south of France who was accused of assaulting several other boys. \"I perceived this priest as someone who was good, a caring person who would not harm me,\" Savignac said. \"But it was when I found myself on that bed half-naked and he was touching me that I realized something was wrong ... Its like gangrene inside the victims body and the victims psyche.\" The priest eventually was found guilty of child sexual abuse and sentenced in 2018 to three years in prison, including one year suspended. The commission worked for 2 1/2 years, listening to victims and witnesses and studying church, court, police and news archives starting from the 1950s. Sauve denounced the churchs attitude until the beginning of the 2000s as \"a deep, cruel indifference toward victims.\" \"Sometimes church officials did not denounce (the sex abuses) and even exposed children to risks by putting them in contact with predators,\" he stressed. The president of the Conference of Bishops of France, Eric de Moulins-Beaufort, said French bishops \"are appalled\" at the conclusions of the report. \"I wish on that day to ask for pardon, pardon to each of you,\" he told the victims. \"No one expected such a high number (of victims) to come out of the survey and that is properly frightening and out of proportion with the perception that weve had on the ground,\" he told the AP. Luc Crepy, the bishop of Versailles who heads an office fighting pedophilia, said \"this is more than a shock. It is a deep feeling of shame.\" Crepy said a process was underway to put together funds and create an independent commission to handle church compensation for the victims. The report comes after a scandal surrounding now-defrocked priest Bernard Preynat rocked the French Catholic Church. Last year, Preynat was convicted of sexually abusing minors and given a five-year prison sentence. He admitted abusing more than 75 boys for decades. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said Pope Francis learned about the reports findings \"with sorrow.\" \"His thoughts go in first place to the victims, with a profound sadness for their wounds and gratitude for their courage to speak out,\" he said. Francis issued in May 2019 a groundbreaking new church law requiring all Catholic priests and nuns to report clergy sexual abuse and cover-ups by their superiors to church authorities. In June, Francis said a process of reform was necessary and every bishop must take responsibility for the \"catastrophe\" of the sex abuse crisis. The shocking estimate of more than a quarter million potential victims dwarfs numbers released by other countries that have also faced national reckoning with church sexual abuse. But each country has investigated the problem in different ways. Instead of limiting itself to specific cases, Frances report made an estimate of the overall scale of the problem, extrapolating the number of victims based on study of specific incidents and nationwide surveys. ------ Masha Macpherson contributed from Paris and Nicolas Vaux-Montagny contributed from Lyon, France.\\nWhile voters across Texas submitted voter registration applications on Monday, Oct. 4, ahead of the Nov. 2 statewide election, 82-year-old Elmira Hicks worried she would not be able to have her vote counted. The Oakwood, Texas, native said she hasn\\'t been able to renew her drivers license for more than a year because she has been unable to present the required birth certificate needed to verify her identity. In the Lone Star State, election laws require voters to present a driver\\'s license, passport, military identification card, citizenship certificate, state election identification certificate or a personal identification card to cast a ballot in person. A person does not need an ID to register to vote, or to vote by mail in the state of Texas. For voters ages 70 and over, an otherwise valid form of ID may be presented when casting a ballot, even if its expired, according to the office of the Texas Secretary of State. If a voter does not possess or cannot reasonably obtain one of the seven acceptable forms of photo ID, the voter may file a Reasonable Impediment Declaration and present a supporting form of ID, such as a bank statement, current utility bill, paycheck or government check. Hicks and her daughter, Jonita White, said they were unaware of the RID process, and that without a drivers license and limited transportation, it\\'s difficult for Hicks to participate in state and federal elections. \"My voice does not count.\" Hicks told ABC News. \"It\\'s very important. People have died just to vote, people have stood in line, in the rain, women fought to vote and now I can\\'t vote.\" Like many Black elders in the South, Hicks was born at a time when records weren\\'t kept. She never had a birth certificate. Her daughter has helped her apply for one. The pair even went to court over the issue, and said a judge ruled in their favor. Still, they said the Office of Vital Statistics rejected Hicks because she filled out an outdated form, according to White. \"I do feel like the laws right now are targeting my mother and other African Americans in this country,\" White said. Eight state constitutional amendments ranging from taxes to judicial eligibility will be up for a vote on Nov. 2, in an election that, as of now, Hicks will not be able to participate in. Advocates warn that potentially thousands of predominantly minority voters could be disenfranchised due to voter identification requirements, which could have large implications during next year\\'s midterm elections for state and congressional races. \"It\\'s often very common for people of a certain age not to have a birth certificate. I want to emphasize it\\'s not as uncommon as people might believe,\" said Franita Tolson, the vice dean for faculty and academic affairs and a professor of law at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. \"In this country, race correlates to a lot of different characteristics. So, for example, if you take voter identification laws ... people of color, so African Americans, Latinos, will be less likely to have the underlying documents that you need in order to get the ID in the first place in order to get a driver\\'s license,\" Tolson continued. Texas recently passed the Election Integrity Protection Act, one of the most restrictive voting laws in the country. It bans drive-thru voting, enlists new regulations for early voting and enacts new ID requirements for mail-in voting. While Tolson does not believe all voter identification requirements are discriminatory, she called Texas\\' voter ID measures \"racist\" during a Congressional Subcommittee hearing on Sept. 22 because she believes they disproportionately impact voters of color. \"Texas has a very restrictive voter ID law,\" Tolson said. \"If you read it, it doesn\\'t seem racist on its face, but if you think about how it operates in practice, as well as the intent behind it, it is fairly racist. For example, Texas\\' law only allows voters to have a certain limited amount of IDs. You have to have a driver\\'s license, you can have a hand handgun license, you can have a military ID, but you can\\'t have a federal ID, or you can\\'t have a student ID, which are the types of IDs that people of color are more likely to have.\" Rep. Steve Toth R-Texas, vehemently disagreed with Tolson\\'s claim that the state\\'s election laws are discriminatory, telling ABC News that the latest legislation makes it easier for people to vote and harder to commit fraud. \"We expanded the number of hours for people to vote, we expanded the number of days so people could vote. We added criminal penalties to people that want to shut voting locations down early or open late. We made sure that employers had to allow people to leave early to vote,\" Toth said, calling Tolson\\'s charge offensive. Nationally, there is bipartisan support for voter identification requirements among the majority of Americans, and 62% of Democrats support photo ID requirements, along with 87% of Independents and 91% of Republicans, according to a Monmouth poll.. Toth told ABC News that voters like Hicks have recourse. \"If they can\\'t get a driver\\'s license, go to DPS {Department of Public Safety], with a social security card, or some other ID, and to get an ID [election identification card] so that you can vote. It\\'s free,\" Toth said, acknowledging that most people vote using their driver\\'s license. White said obtaining an election identification is not so easy for an 82-year-old woman who lives in a rural area without the convenient ability to drive herself to the Department of Public Safety. \"My challenge is it\\'s taking so long to get this done,\" White said. \"And to send my mother through all of these hoops at this age to go get documents notarized, to go get her Social Security application, We\\'re having to look for high school records and baptism information ...To send her through such a process, it really is ridiculous.\" Editors note: This article has been updated with additional information provided by the Texas Secretary of States office.\\nThe Justice Department says it\\'s reviewing an earlier decision to decline prosecution against two former FBI agents embroiled in the Larry Nassar sexual abuse cases after new information has emerged WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said Tuesday that it is reviewing an earlier decision to decline prosecution against two former FBI agents embroiled in the Larry Nassar sexual abuse cases after new information has emerged. In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the newly confirmed assistant attorney general for the departments criminal division will be taking a second look at the FBIs alleged failure to promptly address complaints made in 2015 against Nassar. \"I am deeply sorry that in this case, the victims did not receive the response or the protection that they deserved,\" Monaco said as she testified during a hearing on the renewal of the Violence Against Womens Act. She added, \"I do want the committee, and frankly, I want the survivors to understand how exceptionally seriously we take this issue and believe that this deserves a thorough and full review.\" Monaco did not elaborate on what the new information was, but her testimony comes a couple weeks after USA Olympic gymnasts appeared before the same committee and provided forceful testimony that federal law enforcement and gymnastics officials turned a \"blind eye\" to the USA Gymnastics team doctor\\'s sexual abuse of the gymnasts and hundreds of other women. Last month\\'s hearing was part of a congressional effort to hold the FBI accountable after multiple missteps in investigating the case, including delays that allowed the now-imprisoned Nassar to abuse other young gymnasts. An internal investigation by the Justice Department released in July said the FBI made fundamental errors in the probe and did not treat the case with the \"utmost seriousness\" after USA Gymnastics first reported the allegations to the FBIs field office in Indianapolis in 2015. The FBI has acknowledged its own conduct was inexcusable. In the hearing last month, FBI Director Christopher Wray blasted his own agents who failed to appropriately respond to the complaints and made a promise to the victims that he was committed to \"make damn sure everybody at the FBI remembers what happened here\" and that it never happens again. Hundreds of girls and women have said Nassar sexually abused them under the guise of medical treatment when he worked for Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics, which trains Olympians. He pleaded guilty in federal court to child pornography crimes before pleading guilty in state court to sexually assaulting female gymnasts, and was sentenced in 2018 to 40 to 175 years in prison.\\nThe companies in charge had a duty to prevent the spill, the plaintiffs say. A proposed class-action lawsuit has been filed against the companies who run the oil line that dumped hundreds of thousands of crude oil off the coast of California over the weekend. The federal lawsuit, filed Monday in the Central District of California Western Division, claimed the companies in charge of operating the rig and connected pipelines caused harm to people, wildlife and the local ecosystem by failing to prevent the spill from the platform about 4.5 miles from shore, known as \"Elly.\" The lawsuit also accuses the defendants of failing to warn or provide the public with \"adequate and timely notice of the hazards and their impacts.\" \"At the time of this complaint\\'s filing, deceased animals were washing up covered in oil on the shorelines of the Affected Area and a large ecological reserve nearby had suffered tremendous damage,\" the lawsuit stated, defining the \"Affected Area\" as the stretch of coast between Huntington Beach and Newport Beach and the defendants as Amplify Energy Corporation its subsidiary, the Beta Operating Company and other affiliates that may also hold responsibility. A maximum of 144,000 gallons leaked into the Pacific Ocean after a pipe broke Saturday morning, according to officials. By early Sunday morning, the oil had reached the shore, fanning out over an area of about 5.8 nautical miles and entering the Talbert Marshlands and the Santa Ana River Trail, according to the city of Huntington Beach. As a result, nearby beaches were closed to facilitate the cleanup and prevent residents from inhaling toxic fumes from the crude oil. Dana Point Harbor, about 30 miles south of Huntington Beach, became the latest location to close on Tuesday morning. About 300 people are currently cleaning up the oil spill and an additional 1,500 people will be working on the effort by Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday afternoon. The main plaintiff in the lawsuit, Peter Moses Gutierrez, is a disc jockey who frequently performs on Huntington Beach, according to the lawsuit. Gutierrez expects to lose a \"substantial amount\" of business in the foreseeable future as a result of the spill, the complaint alleges. Gutierrez and other plaintiffs claim they have also been exposed to toxins from the oil, according to the lawsuit. The nearly 18-mile Elly pipeline and the facilities that operate it were built in the late 1970s and early 1980s, according to the lawsuit. The pipeline was likely leaking before the damage was discovered Saturday morning, Orange County supervisor Katrina Foley stated over the weekend. Officials from a division of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife stated in a report that they were notified of an \"observed sheen\" off the Huntington Beach coast at 10:22. p.m. on Friday, according to documents obtained by ABC News. The U.S. Coast Guard was notified of the leak on Saturday morning, Amplify CEO Martyn Willsher told reporters. In a letter to Amplify Energy Corp., the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration demanded corrective actions to the failed pipeline following the leak. In the letter, the associate administrator for pipeline safety said the oil platform\\'s control room received low-pressure alarms on the San Pedro Bay Pipeline at around 2:30 a.m. PDT Saturday, indicating a possible failure. But the line was not shut down until 6:01 a.m. -- 3 and a half hours later. Then, \"over six hours after the initial alarm and three hours after the company shut down the pipeline, Beta Offshore reported the Accident to the National Response Center (NRC) indicating there was a release of crude oil in the vicinity of its pipeline near Platform Elly,\" the letter states. The U.S. Coast Guard submitted a second NRC report at 03:41 p.m. ET, on Sunday reporting oiled marine life and dead fish, according to the letter, and the U.S. Coast Guard submitted a third NRC report later that day, at 05:20 p.m., reporting that the failure may have been caused by a crack in the pipeline. Officials are looking into whether a ship anchor struck the underwater pipeline, damaging it, Willsher told reporters at a news conference Monday. The Beta Operating Company has been cited 125 times for safety and environmental violations since 1980, The Associated Press reported, citing a database from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. It has been fined a total of $85,000 for three incidents. Newsom met with Orange County officials Tuesday afternoon and said he supports their calls to shift away from using fossil fuels. He said he will not support new offshore drilling in California. \"This tragedy did not need to occur and does not need to persist into the future,\" he said. Newsom said more permits were sought in 2020 to abandon oil drilling sites compared to permits establishing new ones. There hasn\\'t been a new offshore lease in half a century, \"and there won\\'t be,\" he said. The governor added that more volunteers will be allowed to help with the cleanup as long as they take a four-hour course on proper procedure. The plaintiffs are requesting a jury trial to determine whether the defendants violated state laws and whether the defendants breached a duty and caused harm to the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit. The jury will also be asked whether restitution and compensatory or consequential damages should be awarded to the plaintiffs. Representatives for the Amplify Energy Corporation did not immediately respond to ABC News\\' request for comment. Calls to the Beta Operating Company were not answered. ABC News\\' Jenna Harrison, Bonnie Mclean, Marilyn Heck, Ivan Pereira and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\\nNo weapons have been found, police said. A man is in custody after he was removed from a suspicious SUV near the Supreme Court Tuesday morning, Capitol police said. The suspect, 55-year-old Dale Paul Melvin of Kimball, Michigan, was removed from the car and placed under arrest around 11 a.m. local time, police said. Earlier in the morning Melvin had allegedly parked illegally and refused to talk to responding officers, authorities said. Police then brought in crisis negotiation officers. There\\'s no information on motive and no weapons have been found, police said. Everyone is safe, police said. There were no disruptions to operations at the Supreme Court; oral arguments began as planned at 10 a.m. The Supreme Court building remains closed to the public. ABC News\\' Devin Dwyer contributed to this report.\\nHearing adjourns with plea for more whistleblowers to speak out After more than three hours of testimony, the Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing with Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who has accused the company of deceiving users and investors and putting \"profits before people,\" has adjourned. While lawmakers battle it out over President Joe Bidens agenda, they united on Tuesday to blast Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburgs silence on Haugen accusations, which raise alarms about the mental health of children and real-world dangers of hate speech she said Facebook knows it perpetuates but ignores. Lawmakers said she has provided hundreds of pages of documents of internal data to back her claims. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the subcommittee chair, closed by reading a text he said he received from a constituent who said he was in tears watching the hearing because, he said, he\\'s seen first-hand how Instagram has changed his teenage daughter. \"\\'My 15-year-old daughter loved her body at 14. Was on Instagram constantly and maybe posting too much. Suddenly she started hating her body. Her body dysmorphia, now anorexia, and was in deep deep trouble before we found treatment. I fear she\\'ll never be the same,\\'\" Blumenthal said, quoting the father. Haugen said \"because of the nature of engagement-based ranking and amplification of interests,\" Facebook and Instagram users are \"pushed towards extreme dieting and pro-anorexia content very rapidly\" -- but that the algorithm perpetuating that could be changed. After raising new allegations concerning Zuckerbergs actions, national security concerns, and employee bonuses tied to a system shown to fuel misinformation, Haugen closed with a call to Congress to address Facebooks growth and provide oversight as its historically done for other industries, like tobacco, in the past. Saying that modern technological systems \"walled off,\" Haugen also called on more whistleblowers with direct knowledge of wrongdoings in big tech to step forward. \"The fact we\\'re being asked these false choices -- it\\'s just an illustration of what happens when the real solutions are hidden inside of companies,\" she said. \"We need more tech employees to come forward through legitimate channels, like the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or Congress, to make sure that the public has the information they need in order to have technologies be human-centric, not computer central.\"\\nIOWA CITY, Iowa -- They grow up in America as de facto Americans, then suddenly face the prospect of self-deportation and family separation. An estimated 200,000 young immigrants living legally in the U.S. for years as dependents of their parents on temporary work visas are aging out of the program into a precarious legal limbo, according to immigrant advocates. After turning 21, many of these children abruptly lose legal immigration status and are forced to choose between returning to their country of birth where theyve spent little time, or remaining in the US illegally to stay with their families. \"Everything I know is American. It just doesnt make sense for me to go back to a country that Ive lived in for 4 months,\" said Pareen Mhatre, 21, a University of Iowa senior and daughter of Indian immigrants who came to the US two decades ago and have built careers with long-term work visas. \"My family and I did everything by the book,\" Mhatre said. \"We have maintained documented status, and were still stuck in this decades long line [for a green card].\" Visa caps and lengthy backlogs for green card applications -- especially for foreign nationals from India and China, who can wait up to 89 years for permanent residency, according to the American Immigration Council -- have compounded the situation for children of long-term visa holders. Once they become adults, their dependent visas expire and they also get removed from pending green card applications filed together with their parents. \"There just hasn\\'t been enough attention to this particular flaw in the immigration system,\" said Dip Patel, founder of the advocacy group Improve the Dream. The government has granted protection and work visas to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants - known as \"Dreamers\" after the never-passed DREAM Act -- through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, but so-called \"documented Dreamers\" dont qualify. A precondition for DACA status is unlawful entry to the U.S. Children of parents on immigrant work visas like Pareen have been residing lawfully in the country. \"There are options for these young immigrants, but all of those options are backlogged for the most part,\" said immigration attorney Jessica Malott. \"So, its not something thats a sure thing, thats gonna happen immediately.\" In a statement to ABC News, the Department of Homeland Security cited several factors contributing to the backlogs, including the pandemic and a lack of adequate staffing, and pledged that officials are working to address the problem. \"DHS is aware of the predicament that these documented dreamers face and is working to find legal means to provide relief where possible,\" the agency said. The issue has also recently won attention from Congress, where members of the House and Senate from both parties have introduced legislation to lift the threat of deportation and the inability to work from this category of legal immigrants. \"Once you meet them, you realize what a contribution theyre already making to this country and what greater contributions they will make in the future,\" said Rep. Deborah Ross, D-N.C., who is co-sponsoring the Americas CHILDREN Act in the House. \"What it does is it sets a path for residency and then, ultimately, after residency, one of these dreamers could pursue citizenship so that a young person doesnt have to immediately self-deport,\" she said of the legislation. A similar measure has been introduced in the Senate by California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla and Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul. \"These children who have legally called the United States home for many years and even decades ... shouldnt be penalized by the governments failures in addressing green card backlogs,\" Paul said in a statement. After turning 21 in April, Mhatre was able to extend her legal status by obtaining a short-term student visa while she finishes her degree in biomedical engineering. After that shell have to either win an employment visa through the lottery, or self-deport to India. \"I knew that I wasnt an American citizen, but I thought I was a permanent resident because America was the only place I had known,\" Mhatre said of her upbringing in Iowa City, Iowa. \"Like \"Dreamers,\" we come to this country as young children. We grow up, and at a certain point - multiple points - in our lives we do face an aspect of self-deportation. But everything I know is American. It just doesnt make sense for me to go back to a country that Ive lived in for 4 months,\" she said. Some families have already experienced slow-rolling family separations under the policy. Byung Yoon, a small business owner and father of three in Portland, Oregon, says his oldest son aged out of a dependent visa and had to return to South Korea on his own. His 17-year-old daughter Hilary -- whos lived in the U.S. since she was an infant -- may be next. \"The only thing I know about Korea is what I see on the media or what my family says. I personally dont have any recollection of Korea,\" Hilary Yoon said. \"She does not speak Korean very well, and she does not understand Korean culture very well,\" added her father. \"We think that some kind of immigration law will pass through. America is an immigrant country.\" Patel, who is himself a documented dreamer from India, says hes optimistic Congress is finally comprehending the scope of the issue and taking steps toward addressing it. \"I think finally, we\\'re at a point where people are starting to recognize that this was an issue in the immigration system that really needs fixing,\" he said. \"We\\'re just going to keep pushing until we can obtain it. And I hope that we\\'re really close.\" Mhatre, who shared her story in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee earlier this year, said shes clear-eyed about the long odds any immigration reform faces but finds hope in her deep love for America. \"There were times when even I was like, why are we doing this, you know, because those times were incredibly tough for my family. But, she added, \"this country is my home.\" ABC News\\' Quinn Owen contributed to this report.\\nFacebook\\'s global power and influence were thrust under a harsh spotlight after a massive outage disrupted services for its entire family of apps, exposing fresh vulnerabilities for the tech giant at a time when it is facing intense, renewed scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers. The company\\'s handful of digital platforms -- including its namesake app, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus -- were down for more than five hours Monday, sowing widespread confusion for the more than 3.5 billion active users the company boasts hosting across its ecosystem of internet services. The apps flickered back online Monday evening, and by Tuesday morning all appeared to be operating normally. The rare outage, however, came at a tense time for the firm. It occurred one day before a scheduled Senate subcommittee hearing with a company whistleblower who leaked documents to lawmakers and the Wall Street Journal that suggest Facebook knew about the negative impacts of its platforms on young users. Moreover, the outage came the same day that Facebook filed a new motion to dismiss an amended antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission that takes aim at the company\\'s market dominance. While the incident spurred a slew of memes and cheeky reactions from competitors like Twitter, Facebook\\'s temporary absence was felt hard in parts of the world such as India and Latin America where its apps serve as digital infrastructure for vital communications and commerce. Here is what to know about the outage that brought the internet to its knees. What caused the outage and why did it last for so long? Santosh Janardhan, Facebook\\'s vice president of infrastructure, shared more information on the cause of the outage in a company blog post Tuesday, after initially giving a vague explanation and apology to those impacted on Monday. Janardhan said the outage \"was triggered by the system that manages our global backbone network capacity.\" \"The backbone is the network Facebook has built to connect all our computing facilities together, which consists of tens of thousands of miles of fiber-optic cables crossing the globe and linking all our data centers,\" he added. The data centers include massive facilities with millions of machines and smaller facilities that connect the backbone network to the broader internet and people using Facebook\\'s platforms, according to Janardhan. When users use an app, it requests data from the device to the nearest facility, which then communicates via the \"backbone network\" to a larger data center, he said. \"The data traffic between all these computing facilities is managed by routers, which figure out where to send all the incoming and outgoing data. And in the extensive day-to-day work of maintaining this infrastructure, our engineers often need to take part of the backbone offline for maintenance -- perhaps repairing a fiber line, adding more capacity, or updating the software on the router itself,\" Janardhan said. \"This was the source of yesterday\\'s outage,\" he said. \"During one of these routine maintenance jobs, a command was issued with the intention to assess the availability of global backbone capacity, which unintentionally took down all the connections in our backbone network, effectively disconnecting Facebook data centers globally.\" In a separate blogpost Monday, Janardhan also offered a brief explanation for why the outage took hours for the tech giant to resolve, saying the underlying cause of the outage also impacted \"many of the internal tools and systems we use in our day-to-day operations, complicating our attempts to quickly diagnose and resolve the problem.\" On Tuesday, he added that hardening of its systems to prevent unauthorized access from malicious activity is also what led to a slower restart following the outage. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a long letter to the company shared publicly Tuesday night that this was the \"worst outage we\\'ve had in years.\" \"We\\'ve spent the past 24 hours debriefing how we can strengthen our systems against this kind of failure,\" he said. Was any personal data compromised? In Monday\\'s initial blog post, Janardhan stated that Facebook has \"no evidence that user data was compromised as a result of this downtime.\" Were hackers or malicious actors involved? Facebook\\'s outage comes in the wake of a spate of high-profile cyberattacks, many involving ransomware, that have put companies and lawmakers on edge in recent months. Janardhan, however, emphasized that the issues that caused the outage were not the result of a hacking incident or cyberattack from a bad actor. \"We want to make clear that there was no malicious activity behind this outage -- its root cause was a faulty configuration change on our end,\" Janardhan stated Monday. On Tuesday, Janardhan added again that the outage was not caused by malicious activity, \"but an error of our own making.\" Why is it such a big deal for some that social networks are offline? In its most-recent earnings report for investors, Facebook said it had 3.51 billion \"monthly active people\" using its family of apps and 2.76 billion \"daily active people\" using its platforms every day -- so its outage was immediately noticeable in an increasingly digital, work-from-home era. In addition to communicating with family and friends, Facebook\\'s services have also emerged as a crucial source of livelihood and commerce for many users. More than 200 million businesses use the company\\'s apps every month, and the need for virtual storefronts and ways to do e-commerce was only heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic\\'s hit to small businesses. Moreover, Facebook and its apps serve as a key lifeline connecting users to the online world in many nations where internet infrastructure and access are still developing. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., lamented the outage\\'s hit to the \"continents of people who depend\" on WhatsApp and Instagram in a tweet pointing to the outsized impact the outage was wreaking in Latin America. Brooke Erin Duffy, a professor of communication at Cornell University, told ABC News that \"there are sprawling categories of workers whose livelihoods depend on the full functioning of these platforms,\" including social media creators and small business owners. Duffy added that the \"abruptness\" of the outage \"highlights the staggering level of precarity that structures our increasingly digitally-mediated work economy.\" According to Facebook, businesses were not charged for ads during Monday\\'s downtime. Ads \"did not deliver during the time the systems were offline, and advertisers were not and will not be billed for ads during the outage,\" the company said in a blog post. What does this have to do with the whistleblower hearing or FTC lawsuit? Monday\\'s outage just happened to occur as the company has been in headlines for separate woes -- including the Tuesday whistleblower hearing and the FTC legal saga. Frances Haugen, an ex-Facebook employee, testified before a Senate subcommittee in Tuesday in the wake of internal research being leaked by her to the press and lawmakers that indicates Facebook was aware of its potential negative impact on the mental well-being of its young users. Haugen told lawmakers on Tuesday about internal evidence she reportedly has showing that the company -- and Zuckerberg -- intentionally ignored proof of its potentially harmful impact on users. Facebook has publicly refuted Haugen\\'s claims, and has said the Journal reporting mischaracterizes what it is trying to do. Zuckerberg also spoke out against what he called \"the false picture of the company that is being painted\" amidst the hearing. \"We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health,\" he said in his note to employees Tuesday. \"It\\'s difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives.\" Meanwhile, as the outage was happening, Facebook on Monday filed a new motion to dismiss the FTC\\'s latest antitrust complaint against it. While the outage happened independent of the suit, lawmakers such as Ocasio-Cortez have pointed to the fallout from the outage as evidence of alleged monopoly power wielded by Facebook. Facebook denied the allegations of anticompetitive practices in a statement Monday. \"The FTC\\'s fictional market ignores the competitive reality: Facebook competes vigorously with TikTok, iMessage, Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn, YouTube, and countless others to help people share, connect, communicate or simply be entertained,\" the company said. \"The FTC cannot credibly claim Facebook has monopoly power because no such power exists.\"\\nThe commissioner of education said schools are breaking laws by requiring masks. Days after the Biden administration reimbursed two Florida school districts whose board members lost their salaries for mandating masks for students, the state\\'s top education official is trying to strip the districts of the money. In a series of memoranda, Florida Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran recommended Monday that the Florida Board of Education, which meets Thursday, withhold \"state funds in an amount equal to any federal grant funds awarded\" to districts that defy Gov. Ron DeSantis\\' ban on school mask requirements. Corcoran said he found probable cause that 11 school districts, including Miami-Dade and Palm Beach, violated state laws by implementing a mask mandate. He also recommended that the Board withhold the salaries of the board members in each district, a punishment already handed down in late August to officials in Alachua and Broward counties. In response to that crackdown, the U.S. Department of Education awarded the Alachua and Broward districts hundreds of thousands of dollars to make up for the lost paychecks. The money was issued through the Project SAFE grant program, which was created last month to reimburse school districts that lose state money for implementing coronavirus mitigation strategies. The Florida Department of Education has not announced that it has begun withholding salaries from school board members in other districts requiring masks. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona indicated in August that districts punished by Florida for requiring masks for students would be eligible for grant money. \"I want you to know that the U.S. Department of Education stands with you,\" he wrote in a letter to superintendents. The 11 districts that Corcoran said violated the law will be under the microscope Thursday, when the Board of Education meets to decide whether to implement the commissioner\\'s recommendations and punish them. District officials in Alachua and Broward counties questioned the legality of blocking federal funding on Tuesday. \"We\\'re always concerned when funds are withheld from public education, but we\\'re particularly concerned about the state interfering with federal funding. This will almost certainly have to be settled in court,\" Dr. Carlee Simon, superintendent of Alachua County Public Schools, said in a statement to ABC News. Dr. Rosalind Osgood, chair of the school board in Broward County, called Corcoran\\'s recommendations to the Board of Education \"extremely displeasing\" and said her district was complying with the law \"and saving lives.\" \"Our students and staff need academic support, mental health support and job security. The way that the Governor and Commissioner of Education have handled this issue has caused added trauma, unemployment and a major disruption in school board operations,\" Osgood said in a statement to ABC News.\\nA former Facebook employee turned whistleblower testified before a Senate Commerce subcommittee on Tuesday -- alleging blatant disregard from Facebook executives when they learned their platform could have harmful effects on democracy and the mental health of children. \"Facebook has not earned our blind faith,\" said former Facebook product manager turned whistleblower Frances Haugen in her opening statement before lawmakers. \"There is a pattern of behavior that I saw [at] Facebook: Facebook choosing to prioritize its profits over people.\" \"You can declare moral bankruptcy, and we can figure out a fix [to] these things together because we solve problems together,\" Haugen said. Minutes after her testimony, Facebook issued a statement attempting to discredit Haugen, stating that she worked for the company \"for less than two years, had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives - and testified more than six times to not working on the subject matter in question.\" Although senators from both parties appeared to support her calls to regulate Facebook, how and when that might happen was unclear. Here are some key takeaways: Lawmaker: Facebook facing its \\'Big Tobacco moment\\' in targeting of children One of the matters in question: Haugen described how she said both platforms, Facebook and Instagram, target children as potential users. \"Facebook understands that if they want to continue to grow they have to find new users. They have to make sure that the next generation is just as engaged with Instagram as the current one, and the way they\\'ll do that, making sure children establish habits before they have good self-regulation,\" Hagen said. \"They know that children bring their parents online -- so they understand the value of younger users for the long-term success of Facebook,\" she added. With several comparisons to the tobacco industry, a majority of Haugen\\'s testimony focused on harmful consequences once she said children get addicted to Facebook\\'s platforms. Notably, around 2019, Facebook started using a revamped algorithm called \"downstream MSI,\" which she said made a post more likely to appear in a user\\'s News Feed if the algorithm calculated people were likely to share or comment on it as it passed down the chain of reshares. This method has led some people, including children, to content promoting eating disorders, misinformation, and hate-targeted posts, according to Haugen and what she said was in internal company documents she\\'s submitted to the committee after leaking them to numerous media outlets. \"Facebook knows its engagement ranking on Instagram can lead children from very innocuous topics like healthy recipes [...] to anorexic content over a very short period of time,\" Haugen alleged. \"Facebook knows they are leading young users to anorexia content.\" Haugen claimed children are a targeted demographic for Facebook, referencing the company\\'s recent project \"Instagram Kids.\" The company paused the project after it came under public scrutiny. \"I would be sincerely surprised if they do not continue working on Instagram kids,\" Haugen speculated, adding Facebook intends \" to make sure that the next generation is just as engaged with Instagram as the current one, and the way they\\'ll do that, making sure children establish habits before they have good self-regulation.\" Whistleblower: \\'Buck stops with Mark\\' Haugen detailed numerous incidents in which she said executives at Facebook, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, were made directly aware of their platforms\\' potentially negative influence on the mental health of children. Zuckerberg and other executives were at one point presented with \"Project Daisy,\" a strategy that removed the number of likes from public Instagram posts. Studies proved the project was not effective, yet Zuckerberg and others went forward to appease regulators and journalists, according to Haugen. \"It would get us positive points from the public,\" Haugen recalled. \"That kind of duplicity is why we need to have more transparency and why, if we want to have a system that is coherent with democracy, we must have public oversight from Congress.\" Zuckerberg, she said, was apparently also presented with options to remove the MSI algorithm in the case of Myanmar, a country where Facebook has been allegedly used to incite violence and spread hate speech. \"Mark was presented with these options and chose to not remove downstream MSI in April of 2020,\" Haugen told the subcommittee. Asked why Facebook wouldn\\'t get rid of downstream MSI when data showed the system expanded hate speech, misinformation and violence-inciting content, Haugen claimed that employee bonuses are still currently tied to the system. Lena Pietsch, director of policy communications at Facebook, released a statement following whistleblower Frances Haugen\\'s testimony attempting to discredit her knowledge of the company, while calling for new internet regulations. \"It\\'s time to begin to create standard rules for the internet,\" Pietsch said in a statement. \"It\\'s been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act.\" Lawmakers on the panel from both parties, operating in a normally divided Washington, were united in calling for Zuckerberg and other Facebook officials to testify before Congress as Haugen had. Zuckerburg has remained silent on Haugen\\'s allegations for days, and multiple senators noted the billionaire\\'s recent social media posts of him put sailing with his wife. Lawmakers signal more hearings, oversight to come Haugen, while outlining what she said were Facebook\\'s flaws, offered up several solutions. She said Facebook could be forced to do things such as forcing a user to click on a link before sharing it, which platforms like Twitter have found that significantly reduced misinformation, she said. She also called for oversight of advertising when it comes to children -- a proposal senators appeared on board with exploring as they pursue possibly regulating Facebook. \"I strongly encourage banning targeted advertisements to children,\" said Haugen. \"And we need to have oversight in terms of [how] the algorithms will likely still learn the interests of kids and match ads to those kids.\" \"Facebook today [makes] approximately $40 billion a year in profit,\" she said at another point. \"A lot of the changes that I\\'m talking about are not going to make Facebook an unprofitable company -- it just won\\'t be a ludicrously profitable company like it is today.\" After Haugen raised concerns around Facebook\\'s resourcing of counterterrorism and teams intended to counter foreign influence -- signaling she was speaking with another congressional committee on that matter -- lawmakers on the subcommittee opened the door to holding another hearing. \"I believe Facebook\\'s consistent understaffing of the counterespionage, information operations and counterterrorism teams is a national security issue, and I\\'m speaking to other parts of Congress about that,\" Haugen said. Sen. Dan, Sullivan, R-Alaska, followed up, \"So, you\\'re saying in essence that the platform whether Facebook knows it or not, is being utilized by some of our adversaries in a way that helps push and promote their interests at the expense of America\\'s?\" \"Yes,\" she replied. \"Facebook is very aware that this is happening on the platform, and I believe the fact that Congress doesn\\'t get a report of exactly how many people are working on these things internally is unacceptable because you have a right to keep the American people safe.\" ABC News\\' Zunaira Zaki, Mary Kathryn Burke and Libby Cathey contributed to this report.\\nCongress must raise the debt limit by Oct. 18, the Treasury said. As the nation barrels toward default, Republicans are poised to sink a Democratic effort to suspend the federal borrowing limit. Republicans in the Senate are filibustering a House-passed measure that would suspend the debt limit until December 2022. At least 10 Republicans would need to join all Senate Democrats to break a GOP filibuster and allow a simple majority vote to pass the bill. Democrats argue that this would give Republicans exactly what they\\'re asking for: an increase to the nations borrowing limit approved solely by Democrats. \"Tomorrow\\'s vote is not a vote to raise the debt ceiling. It\\'s, rather, a procedural step to let Democrats raise the debt ceiling on our own,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday. \"We\\'re telling Republicans that we\\'re not asking you to vote for it, just let us vote for it.\" But Republicans aren\\'t backing down. They\\'ve maintained for months that Democrats must act to raise the federal debt limit on their own, because they have total control of Washington and are planning to pass a multi-trillion social and economic package with zero input from Republicans. \"They said they\\'re perfectly prepared to do the job themselves,\" Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell insisted to reporters Tuesday. \"The easiest way to do that is through the reconciliation process as I pointed out for two months.\" McConnell, R-Ky., has said repeatedly that Democrats should have to hike the debt limit to cover the cost of potentially trillions in yet-passed parts of President Joe Biden\\'s agenda, though the debt limit must be raised to cover spending that already took place under the Trump administration with unified GOP support. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told ABC News on Tuesday he won\\'t support moving forward on a vote. \"We are not going to empower a radical march toward socialism,\" Graham, the top Republican on the Budget Committee, said. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Senate budget committee chairman, floated a potential solution that would involve temporarily suspending the chambers filibuster rules that require 60 votes for most legislation. \"Where it may come down to is a demand that at least for the debt ceiling that we end the filibuster ... and pass it with 51 votes,\" Sanders suggested. But the 50-member Democratic caucus would have to remain unified to do this, and both moderates Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema have balked at any changes to the filibuster rules. No Republican has yet gone on the record to say he or she is prepared to join Democrats to clear the way for a final vote on the debt limit Wednesday, though moderate Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, opened the door to potentially joining the majority. \"I want to make sure we are doing everything that we can to not send us into a situation of default, and I don\\'t even want to get close,\" Murkowski said. \"We have to make sure. We just have to ensure.\" The nation technically hit the debt ceiling Aug. 1, with the Treasury Department using extraordinary measures to pay the nations bills. But Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that by Oct. 18, her departments efforts would be fully exhausted and default would be all but certain. Pressure is mounting alongside partisan gridlock, with no backup plan emerging. McConnell and his conference are insisting that Democrats use a fast-track budget tool called reconciliation that allows the majority to break a filibuster to pass certain legislation. Use of this arcane process is cumbersome, could take weeks and opens up Democrats to a series of potentially politically painful votes. But there could be an added political benefit for Republicans in insisting that this process be used. It would put Democrats on the record raising the debt ceiling by a hefty dollar amount, whereas Wednesday\\'s vote -- simply suspending the debt limit by no specified amount -- does not. That would feed into the GOP narrative that Democrats are out-of-control spenders. \"We\\'re very interested in a specific dollar amount,\" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said Tuesday. \"They\\'re going to have to come before the American people and say, \\'We\\'re going to increase the debt ceiling by X amount, because this is the amount we intend to spend\\', and one way or another, it puts them on the record as to their spending proposals.\" Some Democrats say they\\'d support using reconciliation if it meant a swift resolution of the debt limit issue. Manchin said the process should be considered, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told reporters that \"everything should be on the table\" when pressed on whether the fast-track budget tool should be considered. But each passing day limits the time Democrats would have to fast track a debt ceiling increase through the multi-step process to final passage, and Democrats tell ABC News that no work has begun on the reconciliation process, even behind the scenes. \"No, not at the moment,\" Sanders told ABC News. Some Democrats were more emphatic. \"Reconciliation was never on the table,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. \"There\\'s not enough time to make reconciliation work.\" But on Tuesday, Schumer did not expressly rule it out. When asked if he was ruling out using the budget process, Schumer repeatedly referenced the Wednesday vote as the preferred way to go about hiking the debt cap. \"Reconciliation is a drawn out, convoluted process. We\\'ve shown the best way to go. We\\'re moving forward in that direction,\" Schumer said, refusing to entertain a Plan B. If the nation defaults, the results are sure to be catastrophic. The White House has warned that an unprecedented default could send shockwaves through the global economy and trigger a recession. The political implications for both parties are unclear.\\nThe former police officer who arrested Floyd is now facing murder charges. A request to grant George Floyd a full posthumous pardon is headed to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\\'s desk after a public defender alleged Floyd was framed in a 2004 drug bust by a former Houston police detective now indicted on murder charges. In a letter sent Monday to Floyd\\'s one-time public defender Allison Mathis, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles wrote it has \"completed their consideration of your client\\'s application requesting a Full Pardon and have voted to recommend clemency.\" The board forwarded its recommendation to Abbott for final disposition. Abbott has not said whether he will grant the pardon. Mathis filed the request in April, writing in the petition that a \"pardon is being sought because it is just and right to clear a conviction that is not supported by evidence.\" Floyd was arrested on Feb. 5, 2004, by then-Houston undercover narcotics detective Gerald Goines, who alleged Floyd provided a second suspect .03 grams of crack cocaine to sell, according to the petition. The man Floyd allegedly gave the drugs to turned out to be a police informant who sold the drugs to Goines as part of a sting operation and was not arrested or identified, according to the petition. Floyd eventually pleaded guilty to a drug charge and was sentenced to 10 months in state jail, authorities said. In August 2019, Goines was charged with two counts of murder related to a botched narcotics raid at a home in southeast Houston. Goines\\' police colleague, Steven Bryant, pleaded guilty in June to federal charges of falsifying records and interfering with a government investigation in an attempt to help Goines cover up an illegally obtained \"no-knock\" warrant on the Houston home of Rhogena Nicholas and her husband, Dennis Tuttle. During the Jan. 28, 2019, raid, a shootout erupted in which Nicholas, Tuttle and their dog were killed and four police officers, including Goines, were shot and wounded. In announcing the indictments of Goines and Bryant, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg alleged that Goines made \"numerous false statements\" in the affidavit presented to the judge who signed the \\'no-knock\" warrant. The scandal prompted the Harris County District Attorney to review at least 1,400 criminal cases tied to Goines. Ogg released a statement on Monday supporting the Board of Pardons and Paroles\\' recommendation to grant Floyd clemency. \"We lament the loss of former Houstonian George Floyd and hope that his family finds comfort in Mondays decision by the Texas State Board of Pardons and Paroles to recommend clemency for a 2004 conviction,\" Ogg\\'s statement reads. Mathis also praised the board\\'s decision. \"A man was set up by a corrupt police officer intent on securing arrests rather than pursuing justice,\" Mathis said in a statement. \"No matter what your political affiliation is, no matter who that man was in his life or in his death, that is not something we should stand for in the United States or in Texas.\" Ben Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family, urged Abbott to grant the full pardon. \"This drug charge, which led to George Floyds conviction based on false evidence, helped to unravel his life,\" Crump said in a statement. \"Similarly, tens of thousands of Black lives are ruined by a criminal justice system that uses the war on drugs to target Black people, force them into felony pleas, incarcerate them, take away their voting rights, and destroy their families.\" Floyd died on May 25, 2020, as the result of injuries suffered when police in Minneapolis attempted to arrest him on suspicion of using a phony $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Former police officer Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee into the back of Floyd\\'s neck for more than nine minutes as the 46-year-old Black man lost consciousness after repeatedly claiming of not being able to breathe, was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison. Three other police officers charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter are scheduled to go on trial next year.\\nA friend of U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz has asked a judge to postpone his sentencing until next year so he can continue cooperating with authorities ORLANDO, Fla. -- Joel Greenberg, the friend of U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz who pleaded guilty earlier this year to sex trafficking, asked a judge on Tuesday to postpone his sentencing until next year so he can continue cooperating with federal authorities. Greenberg asked the federal judge in a court filing to move his sentencing date from mid-November to next March. The extra time will give the former local tax collector from an Orlando suburb more time to sit for interviews with federal investigators, the filing said. \"Indeed, Mr. Greenbergs ongoing cooperation, which will not be completed prior to his current sentencing date, could have an impact on his final sentence,\" according to the court filing, which said the extension was unopposed by federal prosecutors. Greenberg is facing up to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty last May to six federal crimes, including sex trafficking of a child, identity theft, stalking, wire fraud and conspiracy to bribe a public official. Greenberg\\'s plea agreement with prosecutors requires continued cooperation with an ongoing probe into sex trafficking. Gaetz, a Republican who represents much of the Florida Panhandle, was not mentioned in Greenbergs plea agreement. But Greenbergs cooperation could play a role in an ongoing investigation into whether Gaetz paid a 17-year-old girl for sex. Gaetz has denied the allegations and previously said they were part of an extortion plot. Orlando criminal defense attorney David Hill, who has no connection to the case, said extra time is sometimes needed in federal probes so that investigators have time to chase leads and verify what a cooperating defendant is telling them. \"If this is potentially going to take down a big fish, and the government thinks there is something to it, they want time to get as much information and verify it as well,\" Hill said. Meanwhile, in Pensacola, a man accused of orchestrating the extortion plot linked to Gaetz\\'s federal sex investigation pleaded not guilty Friday in federal court. The trial of Stephen Alford, 62, is now scheduled for Dec. 6. Authorities said Alford was part of a scheme to get $25 million from a person identified in court records as \"D.G.\" In exchange, Alford said he could secure a pardon from then-President Donald Trump for a family member or get the Department of Justice to drop an investigation into the family member, as well as fund the release of a someone identified as \"R.L.\" Matt Gaetz\\'s father is Don Gaetz, a former president of the Florida Senate. Others who approached Don Gaetz have said in news reports that they wanted to free Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran more than a decade ago. An attorney for Alford did not immediately return a voicemail seeking comment. According to court records, Alford has previous fraud convictions, including a 2006 judgment where he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\\nPresident Joe Biden is urging Republican senators to \"get out of the way\" and let Democrats suspend the nations debt limit WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to \"get out of the way\" and let Democrats suspend the nations debt limit, hoping to keep the U.S. government from bumping dangerously close to a credit default as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell refuses to lend his partys help. Bidens criticism on Monday came with Congress facing an Oct. 18 deadline to allow for more borrowing to keep the government operating after having accrued a total public debt of $28.4 trillion. The House has passed a measure to suspend the debt limit, but McConnell is forcing Senate Democrats into a cumbersome process that could drag on and approach the deadline with little margin for error. Both Biden and McConnell have promised that the country will avoid default, yet the public fight and political posturing risks an economic meltdown. The global economy relies on the stability of U.S. Treasury notes, and unpaid debt could crush financial markets and hurl America into recession. Biden noted that the debt limit applies to borrowing that has already occurred, including under former President Donald Trump, and said Republicans are hurting the country by blocking the limit\\'s suspension. \"They need to stop playing Russian roulette with the U.S. economy,\" Biden said at the White House. \"Republicans just have to let us do our job. Just get out of the way. If you dont want to help save the country, get out of the way so you dont destroy it.\" Unmoved, McConnell said Republicans had given the Democrats a roadmap for dealing with the debt ceiling with months of warning. \"I suggest that our Democratic colleagues get moving,\" McConnell said at the Capitol. Once a routine vote, raising the nations debt limit has become increasingly partisan. Its become a favorite political weapon of Republicans to either demand concessions or force Democrats into unpopular votes to enable more borrowing. McConnell has tied the vote to Biden\\'s multitrillion-dollar tax and economic agenda that awaits Congressional approval. But Biden says the price tag in terms of debt for his plan will be \"zero,\" paid for by raising taxes on corporations and on the wealthy, whom the House Democrats have defined as individuals earning more than $400,000 a year, or couples making more than $450,000. Biden said he planned to talk with McConnell, who dug in with a letter of his own to the president. \"We have no list of demands. For two and a half months, we have simply warned that since your party wishes to govern alone, it must handle the debt limit alone as well,\" the Kentucky senator wrote in the Monday letter. The financial markets have stayed relatively calm with interest rates on 10-year Treasury notes holding just below 1.5%. That rate is slightly higher than the all-time lows set last year as the coronavirus pandemic spread, but it\\'s still lower than at any other time over nearly 60 years of data tracked by the Federal Reserve. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has projected the government will exhaust its cash reserves on Oct. 18, an event she says would likely trigger a financial crisis and economic recession. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned Monday that it would be hazardous for the economy to come anywhere near that deadline. \"The consequences of even approaching the X date could be disastrous for our economy and devastating to American families, raising the costs of borrowing for average Americans and hampering our economic recovery over the long-term,\" Schumer said in a letter to Democratic senators. Democrats and Republicans are in a standoff over how to handle an extension for the debt ceiling. Republicans are insisting that Democrats go it alone with the same legislative tool that is already being used to try and pass Bidens plan to boost safety net, health and environmental programs. Democrats say that extending the debt limit has traditionally been a bipartisan effort and that the debt cap was built up under presidents from both parties. Schumer said that if the debt issue is not resolved this week, the Senate will likely be forced to remain in session during the weekend and possibly the following week when senators were scheduled to be back in their home states. Schumer also discussed the current state of play with the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill that has already passed the Senate and is stuck in the House, as well as Biden\\'s larger, $3.5 trillion effort focused on social programs and the environment that would be offset by tax increases on corporations and the wealthy. He noted that the president visited with House Democrats on Friday to generate support for both measures. \"He encouraged them to stick together, compromise, and find the sweet spot that will allow us to complete our work,\" Schumer said. \"I agree with his sentiment wholeheartedly - we can get this done, together, if we put aside our differences and find the common ground within our party.\" Biden discussed the larger plan with progressive House Democrats during a virtual meeting Monday afternoon. And Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top White House advisers huddled late Monday at the Capitol over it. \"Were making progress, Pelosi said as she exited. Schumer had said in an earlier letter to colleagues they need to reach a deal soon, preferably \"days, not weeks.\" Schumer and McConnell debated the debt ceiling when the Senate earlier Monday. McConnell noted that Biden voted against raising the debt ceiling as a senator when Republicans controlled Congress and the presidency. But Schumer said Democrats allowed for an up-or-down vote back then rather than requiring the majority to overcome a filibuster. He said Republicans should follow that example when he seeks to bring up the House-passed bill that would suspend the debt ceiling until December 2022. \"We arent asking Republicans to support it when it comes time for a vote. We only ask that they get out of the way, let Democrats pass it on our own just as the majority party did in the early 2000s,\" Schumer said. \"The fact is we dont have the luxury of waiting until Oct. 18 to extend the debt ceiling,\" Schumer added. \"Even a near miss can have dramatic consequences.\" Biden will be traveling to Michigan on Tuesday to promote his legislative plan as negotiations resume in Washington. Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have said they won\\'t back a $3.5 trillion spending bill. And many House Democrats won\\'t support the smaller bipartisan infrastructure plan until they get an agreement on the larger measure. ------ AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.\\nThe DAG said she was \"shocked\" and \"horrified\" by the gymnasts\\' testimonies. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at a Senate hearing Tuesday that the Department of Justice is conducting a review into its decision to not bring charges against agents who failed to investigate allegations of sex abuse by former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. Less than three weeks ago, gymnasts Simone Biles, McKayla Maroney, Maggie Nichols and Aly Raisman testified before the Senate over alleged FBI failures in handling the case against Nassar. Monaco\\'s announcement followed widespread condemnation from lawmakers during a blockbuster hearing last month with the gymnasts, who detailed horrific experiences of sexual assault, and a damning inspector general report that highlighted the abuses and how agents initially on the case appear to have mishandled the athletes\\' allegations. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were deeply critical of the Justice Department last month for declining their invitation to attend the hearing alongside FBI Director Christopher Wray and IG Michael Horowitz. \"I can inform the committee today that the recently confirmed assistant attorney general for the criminal division [Kenneth Polite] is currently reviewing this matter, including new information that has come to light,\" Monaco said. \"In light of that review, I think you\\'ll understand, Mr. Chairman, that I\\'m constrained in what more I can say about it, but I do want the committee, and frankly I want the survivors, to understand how exceptionally seriously we take this issue and believe that this deserves a thorough and full review.\" Monaco further assured Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., there was a \"sense of urgency and gravity\" with the recently launched review. Earlier in her testimony, Monaco said she was \"shocked\" and \"horrified\" both about the findings included in the DOJ IG\\'s report as well as the experiences detailed by Biles, Maroney, Nichols and Raisman. \"I am deeply sorry that in this case the victims did not receive the response or the protection that they deserved,\" Monaco said.\\nIn a reversal of Trump administration policy, the State Department has disclosed the number of nuclear weapons in the U.S. stockpile WASHINGTON -- In a reversal of Trump administration policy, the State Department on Tuesday disclosed the number of nuclear weapons in the U.S. stockpile. It said this will aid global efforts to control the spread of such weapons. The number of U.S. weapons, including those in active status as well as those in long-term storage, stood at 3,750 as of September 2020, the department said. That is down from 3,805 a year earlier and 3,785 in 2018. As recently as 2003, the U.S. nuclear weapon total was slightly above 10,000. It peaked at 31,255 in 1967. The last time the U.S. government released its stockpile number was in March 2018, when it said the total was 3,822 as of September 2017. That was early in the Trump administration, which subsequently kept updated numbers secret and denied a request by the Federation of American Scientists to declassified them. \"Back to transparency,\" said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. He said the Biden administration was wise to reverse the prior administration\\'s policy. Kristensen said disclosing the stockpile number will assist U.S. diplomats in arms control negotiations and at next year\\'s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty conference, which will review the disarmament commitment made by nuclear powers who are treaty signatories, including the United States. The Biden administration is conducting a nuclear weapons posture and policy review that is expected to be completed early next year. At the Conference on Disarmament last February, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \"President Biden has made it clear: the U.S. has a national security imperative and a moral responsibility to reduce and eventually eliminate the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction.\"\\nU.S. officials have approved a long-lasting fire retardant that could significantly aid in fighting increasingly destructive wildfires BOISE, Idaho -- U.S. officials on Tuesday approved a long-lasting fire retardant that could significantly aid in fighting increasingly destructive wildfires by stopping them before they ever start. The U.S. Forest Service approved Perimeter Solutions fire retardant that is intended to be used as a preventative measure and can last for months. Its similar to the companys red-dyed retardant dropped from aircraft while fighting active wildfires, but its clear and sprayed by ground-based workers and equipment. \"The real game-changer here is once you treat it, you can forget it,\" said Edward Goldberg, chief executive officer of St. Louis, Missouri-based Perimeter Solutions. \"Its there for the whole year.\" The company said its primary use will be by industrial customers such as utility companies and railroads, but it can also be used to protect residential and commercial properties. Its intended to be sprayed on vegetation, not homes themselves, but can be sprayed on such things as wood fences. The companys existing retardant is also used for that purpose, but can be problematic because its only effective until rain washes it away. Goldberg said the new product will remain effective even after a couple inches of rain, making the one-and-done application less expensive. Cost, Goldberg said, depends on the topography and ranges from $7,000 to $15,000 per mile (1.6 kilometers) covering a 20-foot (6-meter) -wide strip. Goldberg said the product will likely be most effective in the drier climate of the U.S. West, and could be applied in the spring to offer fire protection throughout the wildfire season. In July, it was applied to the grounds at former President Ronald Reagans coastal mountain ranch in the Santa Ynez mountains in California near Santa Barbara. The company also said the new fire retardant had been applied at the start of the wildfire season along a fire-prone, 4-mile (6.5-kilometer) stretch of Californias Route 118. That resulted in no fires that season, the company said, after the previous fire season saw 37 fires start along the same stretch of road. Stanton Florea, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service based at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, said the agency had no comment about its approval of the Perimeter Solutions fire retardant. Goldberg said the new retardant has the potential to reduce the overall number of wildfires, freeing up firefighters that have been in short supply in recent years. The fire center on its website said that so far this year, about 46,500 wildfires have burned 10,000 square miles (26,000 square kilometers). Those numbers are at roughly the 10-year average for number of wildfires and area burned. Currenlty, there are 52 large wildfires, 18 of them in Idaho, nine in California and nine more in Montana. The center is currently at National Preparedness Level 3, having dropped down from the maximum level 5 earlier this year when resources for fighting wildfires were hard to come by. The center said that cooler, more favorable weather will pass through much of the Western U.S. in the next several days, but that drought conditions still leave the region open for continued wildfire potential.\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday will wrestle with the limits of the government state secrets privilege in a high-stakes case brought by the first al-Qaida suspect detained and harshly interrogated at a CIA \"black site\" after Sept. 11, 2001. Abu Zubaydah, who was captured in Pakistan in 2002, was waterboarded 83 times, spent 11 days in a coffin-size confinement box and was subjected to \"walling, attention grasps, slapping, facial holds, stress positions and sleep deprivation,\" according to a declassified 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report. He wants the U.S. government to publicly confirm that Poland was one of the locations of his interrogation and allow depositions of two CIA contractors involved with his treatment through the agencys controversial rendition, detention and interrogation program, also known as the \"torture program.\" Zubaydah and his legal team said the information is critical to a case they are pursuing overseas against Polish government officials for alleged complicity in his treatment. The Biden administration said in court documents that revealing the information would \"cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.\" \"We have a confrontation in this case between openness and secrecy -- major principles that have so corrosively confronted one another during this entire era of modern American history,\" said University of Chicago law professor and legal historian Farah Peterson. Zubaydah, 50, has been detained at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, without charge since 2006. For years, the government asserted that he was a plotter in the 9/11 attacks, but officials later acknowledged that he was not tied to the operation, according to the 2014 report. Today, the Biden administration calls Zubaydah \"an associate and longtime terrorist ally of Osama bin Laden.\" His attorneys insist \"none of these allegations has support in any CIA record.\" While many details of Zubaydahs treatment in U.S. custody have been public for years -- published in declassified congressional documents, media reports and other outside investigations -- the American government has never formally confirmed, nor denied, the existence of a black site in Poland or that Zubaydah was held there for five months between 2002 and 2003. The European Court of Human Rights, independent investigations by international advocacy groups and several former top Polish officials have each pointed to the existence of a CIA site in Poland and alleged that Zubaydah was held there. \"Its [about] protecting whether the [U.S.] government has any official confirmation of what foreign country does, or does not, cooperate with them,\" said Beth Brinkmann, a former deputy assistant attorney general for the Obama administration, at a recent event at William & Mary Law School. \"Theres an interesting government interest in the government saying something and confirming something.\" \"It might have a chilling effect on other countries being willing to cooperate with us if they know it might come out,\" added Andrew Pincus, a Yale Law School professor, at the same event. Zubaydahs attorneys argue that because so many details of the CIA program are widely known, the governments blanket assertion of the state secrets privilege is too broad and illegal. \"The two former CIA contractors who devised and implemented the torture program ... have twice testified under oath about what they saw, heard and did at various black sites, including what they did to Abu Zubaydah and some of what they observed at the black site at issue in this litigation,\" they wrote in court documents. \"It is undisputed that this testimony contains no state secrets.\" Lower courts have split over the subpoenas for evidence in Zubaydahs case. A federal district court sided with the government, but the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the decision. \"The district court erred in quashing the subpoenas in toto rather than attempting to disentangle nonprivileged from privileged information,\" the panel wrote. The Supreme Court will now parse whether sensitive information already in the public domain can be still subject to the state secrets privilege and to what extent information from government contractors may be protected for national security concerns. A decision in favor of Zubaydah could help him expose more information about the now-defunct, secretive CIA program and advance his case against Polish officials overseas. A decision siding with the U.S. government could bolster the power of the state secrets privilege and limit future attempts at exposure of classified information related to national security. The CIA did not immediately respond to ABC News\\' request for comment on the case. Several family members of 9/11 victims have weighed in on the case at the Supreme Court in support of Zubaydah. \"The arc of the moral universe has been twisted and bent over the last 20 years, with justice sadly eluding both the families of the 9/11 dead and the accused, who were, like Mr. Zubaydah, tortured at government black sites,\" said Adele Welty, the mother of New York City firefighter Timothy Welty, who was killed in the attack. \"In the interest of justice so long denied, we implore the government to separate properly classified information from unclassified and release all relevant documents.\"\\nThere\\'s a disconnect between whats being said and done about the debt ceiling. The TAKE with Rick Klein The disconnect between whats being said about handling the debt ceiling and whats likely to have to get done is as wide as ever -- and its not for lack of honesty from congressional leaders about what they intend to do. On Wednesday, barring a major surprise, Senate Republicans will block an effort by Democrats to suspend the debt ceiling through next December. Democrats will accuse them of hypocrisy and worse, with less than two weeks of borrowing left before the Treasury Department runs out of cash. Theyll be right on the merits, up to and including the financial calamities that could come if the United States cant pay its bills. But that wont change the governing reality -- even aside from the fact that talking points and even voting strategies on the subject have reliably flipped along with control of Washington. Focus has been trained on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell over his absolute refusal to go along with any efforts to authorize additional debt. McConnell, though, is representing the overwhelming, if not unanimous, view inside his conference. Republicans see this moment as an opportunity to do what they can to stifle the Democrats agenda, and they are relying on the party in power to do the only responsible thing. That may break norms, but it leaves Democrats with only one real option: using the budget \"reconciliation\" process to get around the GOP entirely, in what represents a tough political vote for many members. It seems inevitable that Democrats will get there, unless or until attempts to shame Republicans into cooperation pay off or a few minds are changed among Democrats who say they wont change filibuster rules. President Joe Biden on Tuesday used a trip to Michigan to remind those watching of the \"clear majority\" he won last November to make the case for the balance of his domestic agenda. That was a simple statement of fact. Yet the fact that Democrats enjoy majority status means something to both parties -- and is still shaping the political rules. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper The Biden administration is taking a confrontational tone with a GOP governor who has sought to undermine masking guidance in schools. The Treasury Department has put Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on notice, calling for the state to stop funding a grant program for schools that deliberately excludes schools with mask mandates from eligibility. \"Our COVID-19 Educational Recovery Benefit will empower parents to exercise their choice when it comes to their childs education and COVID-19 mitigation strategies,\" Ducey said of the grants in August. A letter to Ducey from the Treasury Department describes the programs as an impermissible use of federal funds. \"We are concerned that two recently created Arizona grant programs undermine evidence-based efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19,\" Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo wrote. It\\'s an example of the administration making good on President Joe Bidens previous promise to push back on GOP governors who aim to evade COVID-19 health guidance. If Arizona doesnt address the issue in 30 days, the state could see federal funding revoked. The TIP with Quinn Scanlan In a development unlikely to be on anyone\\'s campaign bingo card, Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe is now microtargeting Taylor Swift\\'s loyal fan base of \"Swifties\" in a five-figure digital ad buy against his Republican opponent, Glenn Youngkin. Why? Youngkin was co-CEO of the Carlyle Group during Taylor Swift\\'s public showdown with top music executive Scooter Braun in 2019 over him gaining the rights to the master recordings for her first six albums. The private equity firm had backed Braun\\'s deal that led to the acquisition. Swift called on Carlyle to help at the time, and according to reporting from the New York Times, the firm brought the parties toward a resolution. McAuliffe has his own affiliation with Carlyle but was only a \"passive investor\" in 2019, and those investments didn\\'t pertain to this deal, his spokesperson Renzo Oliveri said. The ads, which are part of a larger online get out the vote effort, will reach a \"universe of persuadable voters who like Taylor Swift content and engage with her content.\" Youngkin campaign spokesperson Christian Martinez called it \"pathetic.\" The GOP nominee\\'s campaign has been targeting what\\'s likely a much bigger base of voters in the commonwealth -- parents -- after McAuliffe said in last week\\'s debate he doesn\\'t \"think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\" The Youngkin campaign is running a TV ad, with a six-figure backing, highlighting that line statewide and has launched a mobilization effort to contrast him with McAuliffe on this issue.

On Sept. 1, Brian Laundrie returned to his parent\\'s home in North Port, Florida, by himself in Petito\\'s van, according to authorities. Petito was reported missing on Sept. 11 by her family in Long Island, New York, authorities said. Cassie Laundrie, who lives in Florida with her husband and two sons, told ABC News that her brother and parents stopped by for an \"ordinary\" visit the day he returned. \"I really wish he had come to me first that day with the van,\" she said, \"because I don\\'t think we\\'d be here.\" Brian Laundrie was subsequently named a \"person of interest\" in Petito\\'s disappearance. He has refused to speak to investigators and has not been seen since Sept. 14, according to authorities. On Sept. 16, the Moab City Police Department in Utah released body-camera footage of their officers\\' interaction with Brian Laundrie and Petito after pulling them over in Petito\\'s van on Aug. 12. The officers were responding to a 911 call that reported an incident between the couple, in which the caller claimed he witnessed Laundrie allegedly \"slapping\" Petito and chasing her up and down a sidewalk, hitting her. The officers wrote in a report that Laundrie and Petito admitted to arguing and that Petito had slapped Laundrie. The couple also told the officers that Laundrie did not hit Petito, according to the report. After speaking to Petito and Laundrie separately, the officers allowed the couple to continue on their way but ordered them to spend the night apart. No charges were filed. Cassie Laundrie told ABC News that it was \"pretty typical of them to argue and try and take space from each other.\" But she said she never witnessed any signs of domestic violence. On Sept. 19, the Teton County Coroner\\'s Office in Wyoming announced that a body was recovered in the Bridger-Teton National Park. Two days later, the coroner confirmed the remains were that of Petito and that an initial determination showed she had died as a result of homicide. A federal arrest warrant was later issued for Brian Laundrie in Wyoming, pursuant to a federal grand jury indictment related to his \"activities\" following Petito\\'s death, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The twist and turns of the case have grabbed national attention, as the search for Brian Laundrie continues. Cassie Laundrie told ABC News that she does not know where her brother is and if she did, she would \"turn him in.\" She said the last time she saw or heard from him was on Sept. 6, when their family went to Fort De Soto Park in Florida\\'s Pinellas County. \"We just went for a couple of hours and we ate dinner and had s\\'mores around the campfire and left, and there was nothing peculiar about it,\" she said. \"There was no feeling of grand goodbye. There was no nothing.\" \"I\\'m frustrated that, in hindsight, I didn\\'t pick up on anything,\" she added. \"It was jut a regular visit.\" She said it\\'s unusual for her brother to disappear for this long. \"I worry about him. I hope he\\'s OK, and then I\\'m angry and I don\\'t know what to think,\" she said. \"I hope my brother is alive because I want answers just as much as everybody else.\" She said she has been cooperating with authorities \"since day one,\" and she called on her parents to do the same. \"I don\\'t know if my parents are involved,\" she said. \"I think if they are, then they should come clean.\" An attorney for the Laundrie family has previously told ABC News in a statement that the parents, Chris and Roberta Laundrie, \"do not know where Brian is.\" \"They are concerned about Brian and hope the FBI can locate him,\" the attorney said. \"The speculation by the public and some in the press that the parents assisted Brian in leaving the family home or in avoiding arrest on a warrant that was issued after Brian had already been missing for several days is just wrong.\" While she remains concerned for her brother, Cassie Laundrie told ABC News that she is also mourning for Petito and wants the Petito family to know that her heart is with them. \"They deserve answers,\" she said.\\nThe Biden administration on Tuesday ordered Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to stop using the states federal pandemic funding on a pair of new education grants that can only be directed to schools without mask mandates The Biden administration on Tuesday ordered Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to stop using the states federal pandemic funding on a pair of new education grants that can only be directed to schools without mask mandates. In a letter to Ducey, the Treasury Department said the grant programs are \"not a permissible use\" of the federal funding. Its the latest attempt by the Biden administration to push back against Republican governors who have opposed mask mandates and otherwise sought to use federal pandemic funding to advance their own agendas. Ducey, a Republican, created the grant programs in August to put pressure on school districts that have defied the states ban on mask mandates. He launched a $163 million grant program using federal funding he controls, but he made it available only to schools without mask mandates. He also established a $10 million program that offers vouchers to families at public schools that require masks or that tell students to isolate or quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure. In the letter, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the conditions \"undermine evidence-based efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19.\" He asked the state to explain how it will \"remediate\" the problem within 30 days. C.J. Karamargin, a spokesperson for Ducey, said it\\'s \"baffling\" why anyone would oppose the grant programs. \"Following the challenges during the 2020 school year, everyones primary focus should be equipping families with the resources to get their kids caught up. Thats exactly what this program does -- giving families in need the opportunity to access educational resources like tutoring, child care, transportation and more,\" Karamargin said in a statement. He said the governor\\'s office is reviewing the letter and plans to respond. Arizona is one of at least eight states that have laws or executive orders banning mask requirements in public schools. The Education Department in August opened civil rights investigations into five Republican-led states that forbid mask mandates in schools, saying such actions may violate the rights of students with disabilities. The agency later added Florida to the list of states under investigation. It said it was watching several other states in case it needed to take action, including in Arizona. The Education Department separately promised to repay school districts who have state funding withheld for defying bans on mask requirements. Last month, the agency sent nearly $150,000 to the School Board of Alachua County in Florida after the state withheld pay for school board members because the district requires masks. Education advocates have filed a lawsuit over Arizonas ban and several other state laws that restrict the power of local governments and school districts to impose COVID-19 requirements. Those policies conflict with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends universal mask wearing for students and teachers in the classroom. The CDC issued the guidance in light of the rapid spread of the highly contagious delta variant of COVID-19.\\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogans former chief of staff has been indicted in federal court for allegedly defrauding a state agency he led ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan\\'s former chief of staff has been indicted on charges that he defrauded a state agency he led by inducing it to pay him nearly $280,000 in mostly severance pay before he moved to his post in the governor\\'s office, the Maryland U.S. attorney announced Tuesday. Roy McGrath also used funds from the Maryland Environmental Service to pay a personal pledge to a museum and got the agency to pay tuition expenses for a class after he left his job as executive director, according to the indictment. He also recorded conversations with senior state officials without their consent and faces state charges, it said. \"Our federal and state law enforcement team in Maryland will always hold accountable public officials who betray the public trust for their personal gain,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan Lenzner said in a statement. \"Maryland residents should always demand honesty and integrity from those in government.\" McGrath of Naples, Florida, fraudulently obtained $276,731 from the environmental service, according to the indictment. He is expected to have an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Baltimore and a state court appearance in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court, but no dates have been set. The Baltimore Sun, which first reported the story, said McGrath characterized the case as \"political persecution.\" His attorney, Bruce Marcus, wrote in an email to The Associated Press that his client \"vigorously and categorically denies the allegations.\" \"He looks forward to clearing his good name and reputation at a trial on the merits,\" Marcus said. McGrath resigned in August 2020 when he was just 11 weeks into the job as Hogan\\'s top aide, after the payments became public. Michael Ricci, Hogan\\'s spokesman, described the charges Tuesday as \"very serious and deeply troubling.\" \"Over the last year, our office has actively assisted law enforcement in these ongoing investigations,\" Ricci said in a statement. \"We commend both federal and state prosecutors for their diligence and professionalism. As this case moves to the courts, we are confident that the justice system will uphold the public trust.\" McGrath was appointed by Hogan to serve as executive director of the environmental agency in December 2016. The corporation owned by the state provides environmental services such as water and wastewater management and other services to state and local government agencies, federal government entities, and private clients. The federal and state charges allege that from March 2019 through December 2020, McGrath personally enriched himself by using his positions of trust as the director and the chief of staff for the governor to get the agency to make payments to McGrath. The indictment alleges that McGrath got the agency\\'s board to approve paying him a $233,647 severance payment -- equal to one years salary -- upon his departure by falsely telling them the governor was aware of and approved the payment. When Hogan learned about the severance package and questioned McGrath about it, McGrath falsely told him that the board of directors had offered him the severance payment in accordance with its usual practice, the indictment said. If convicted of the federal charges, McGrath faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each of four counts of wire fraud; and a maximum of 10 years in federal prison for each of two counts of embezzling funds from an organization receiving more than $10,000 in federal benefits.\\nOpening statements are underway Tuesday in the corruption trial of a powerful Philadelphia labor leader and a city official he allegedly kept on the union payroll PHILADELPHIA -- A powerful Philadelphia labor leader kept a city council member on the union payroll in a no-show, $70,000-a-year job so he would do his bidding at City Hall, federal prosecutors said Tuesday as a long-awaited corruption trial began. The sweeping 2019 indictment accused Johnny \"Doc\" Dougherty and City Council member Bobby Henon of engaging in an illegal conspiracy to keep a tight grip on construction jobs in the Philadelphia region. \"All Henon had to do to keep those benefits flowing to him (was) to use his official duties to please John Dougherty,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Bea Witzleben said, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. Dougherty, 61, is one of the states most influential political donors, having steered more than $30 million over the years to mostly Democratic candidates. His brother sits on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The trial evidence will include wiretaps of his phone calls to Henon, Mayor Jim Kenney and others over a 16-month period, Witzleben said. He will later face a second trial for parts of the indictment that allege he and others embezzled more than $600,000 from Local 98 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which he leads, and a potential third trial on other charges. But first, prosecutors hope to prove that Dougherty used Henon to press Comcast Corp. to steer $2 million worth of electrical work to a friend during cable contract talks with the city; to shut down the non-union installation of MRI machines at Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia; and to investigate a towing company that seized Doughertys car. Defense lawyer Hank Hockeimer called Dougherty a \"big brother\" to the younger Henon, who is a former union electrician, and defended his client\\'s \"bombastic\" style. And he questioned the alleged bribes at the heart of the case. \"Two years of salary, and Eagles tickets, those are the \\'bribes,\" Hockeimer said, making air quotes around the word. The trial is expected to last about six weeks. Both Dougherty and Henon have pleaded not guilty.\\nSeven of the more than 50 passengers injured in an Amtrak train derailment in Montana last month have filed federal lawsuits accusing the rail line and the operator of the railroad tracks of negligence, saying the crash could have been prevented. \"Trains just don\\'t derail by themselves,\" Sean Driscoll, a partner at Clifford Law Offices in Chicago and lead counsel for the plaintiffs, told ABC News on Tuesday. The lawsuits were filed separately on Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Chicago on behalf of a Massachusetts couple, a Pennsylvania couple, an Indiana couple and a man from Montana. Driscoll said the plaintiffs aee not only recovering from their injuries but also coping with severe emotional and psychological traumas from the carnage they witnessed. The train that crashed in Montana was carrying 146 passengers and 16 crew members when it derailed. Three passengers were killed. Amtrak\\'s Empire Builder train headed from Chicago to Seattle derailed near Joplin, Montana, on Sept. 25, sending several cars toppling onto their sides. The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Administration are investigating the crash and have yet to publicly announce a cause for the disaster. The NTSB said it plans to release a preliminary report on the crash later this month. But Driscoll told ABC News that an investigation by his law firm has already collected enough evidence to allege the crash could have been avoided. \"We have assembled a team of experts including former NTSB investigators who are conducting a thorough examination of all aspects of this tragic derailment,\" Driscoll said. \"We will get answers. They (the plaintiffs) will get justice.\" The lawsuits also name the BNSF Railway Company, which owns and operates the track the derailment occurred on, as a defendant in the cases. Neither BNSF nor Amtrak would comment on the lawsuits. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of life and injuries due to the derailment of the Empire Builder train on Sept. 25, near Joplin, Mont., on BNSF railroad. It is inappropriate for us to comment further on pending litigation,\" Amtrak said in a statement to ABC News on Tuesday. Driscoll said the lawsuits also seek to challenge an Amtrak policy instituted in January 2019 requiring that legal action against the company be resolved through a mandatory arbitration process. Under the change, customers, upon purchasing a ticket, waive their right to sue Amtrak for any reason. Amtrak made the change after losing or being forced to settle several large lawsuits stemming from other crashes, including reaching a $57 million settlement related to a 2017 crash in DuPont, Washington, that killed three people and injured more than 60. An NTSB investigation concluded that the DuPont crash was the result  of inadequate training by the locomotive engineer, who was traveling too fast to negotiate a hazardous curve. The Montana derailment lawsuits contend BNSF had issued a slow-down order for the East Buelow switching point section of track where the derailment occurred due to maintenance being performed. \"Upon information and belief, BNSF did not communicate information regarding the true condition of the track at and around the East Buelow switch point,\" each of the lawsuits states. The train, according to the lawsuits, was going 78 mph, which is about the normal speed limit for the area. The crash occurred in a gradual curve of the East Buelow switch point, according to the NTSB. The lawsuits allege Amtrak and BNSF failed to properly inspect the track or \"ascertain whether it was in a safe condition for the passage of passenger trains.\" Eight of the train\\'s 10 cars and two locomotives derailed, four of them toppling onto their sides, officials said. Ryan and Hanna Shea of Massachusetts, two of the people who filed suit, said they were in their sleeper car, headed to Seattle to visit family, when they felt a series of jolts that \"threw us against the walls of our roomette.\" \"This was our first train trip, and we were planning on primarily traveling by train for future trips if everything went well,\" the couple said in a statement released by their lawyers. \"We hope that it is through our lawsuits that rail will again be a trusted way to travel and that Amtrak will admit the mistakes it made here and do the right thing. The status quo is obviously not safe enough.\" Driscoll said his law firm has been contacted by other passengers injured in the incident and will be filing more lawsuits in the near future.\\nSoccer authorities in Australia have urged players to make formal complaints in any cases of sexual misconduct after one of the countrys leading international goal scorers alleged shed been groomed and harassed by senior players early in her career SYDNEY -- Soccer authorities in Australia have urged players to make formal complaints in any cases of sexual abuse or misconduct after one of the countrys leading international goal scorers alleged shed been groomed and harassed by senior players early in her career. Lisa De Vanna, who played 150 games for Australia and was second on the list of all-time of scorers for the womens national team with 47 goals, said she first experienced harassment, abuse and bullying in 2001 when she joined a national womens squad at age 17. She told Sydney\\'s Daily Telegraph newspaper she\\'d been pulled down from behind by a few teammates and \"I fought my way off the floor kicking and screaming.\" \"They thought it was funny. I was just a young kid from Perth, I didnt know any different. I ... wanted to punch them,\" De Vanna said. \"As a youngster and a player I didnt know how to address this ... but it is still happening across all levels and its time to speak up.\" De Vanna went public with her allegations in the wake of the scandal in the United States, where the National Womens Soccer League called off games on the weekend and its commissioner quit amid a sexual harassment and misconduct allegations involving a longtime coach. The NWSL was rocked last week when two former players came forward with allegations of harassment, including sexual coercion, against North Carolina Courage coach Paul Riley. Riley was immediately fired by the Courage, and both FIFA and U.S. Soccer opened investigations into why he was able to continue coaching even after the players brought their concerns to the league. Riley told The Athletic the allegations were \"completely untrue.\" De Vanna initially reacted on social media to a tweet from U.S. soccer great Megan Rapinoe, who posted the message \"Men protecting men, who are abusing Women\" in response to the NWSL scandal. De Vanna posted that she agreed with Rapinoe, but she\\'d also witnessed \"women protecting women who abuse women\" and \"players protecting senior players who abuse younger players\" and organizations protecting \"coaches/players\" who abuse players. \"Abuse is abuse. Poor behavior is poor across all boards!\" In the Daily Telegraph story, De Vanna said she\\'d seen \"cultural problems at all levels -- from men and women -- and girls coming through need to be brave, and also the girls that have been through this also need to be brave and know they are not alone.\" \"In any sporting organization and in any environment, grooming, preying and unprofessional behavior makes me sick.\" De Vanna retired from professional football last month after playing for clubs in Australia, the U.S., England, Sweden and Italy. Football Australia said it had met with De Vanna and \"heard her grievances\" but the specific allegation was not raised at the meeting. \"In the event that Lisa chooses to lodge a formal complaint through the appropriate channels, we will be in a position to investigate and, if appropriate, act accordingly,\" Football Australia said in a statement released late Tuesday. \"We encourage anyone to bring forward their concerns through Football Australias formal complaints process.\" The national players\\' union, Professional Footballers Australia, said it was \"deeply concerned\" at the claims. \"We recognize that the decision to speak publicly would not have been made lightly,\" the PFA said in a statement. \"It is critical that the sport provides a safe and inclusive workplace and, importantly, the players are supported to come forward.\" ------ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports\\nIts an exciting time to be at Walt Disney World Resort!

Today, Im honored to share this story about Steve Limones, an entertainment performer at Disneyland Resort. Raised in a Spanish-speaking home by parents who emigrated from Ecuador to Northern California, Steve Limones and his family adapted quickly to American culture. \"Growing up, I thought \\'I have to be like white people because thats what I knew,\" Steve said about his experience going to a Christian private school in a predominantly white community. \"I would get embarrassed if I had to speak Spanish.\" Steve Limones with his younger twin brothers and grandfather, Papa Humbertito, in Ecuador Steve knew from a young age that his ultimate dream was to sing, act and dance as a performer at Disneyland. When he went to study musical theater in grad school, Steves background became more front and center. \"My professors didnt know where to place me,\" he said as he recalled being cast in standard Hispanic roles, instead of roles that were traditionally represented by white actors. While he worked at Disneyland through college and later acted professionally after grad school, Steve jumped at the opportunity to perform at Tokyo Disney Resort, where he eventually met his husband, James. Back in California, Steve was cast in Disneyland shows like \"ElecTRONica\" and \"Mad T Party,\" and later became part of the iconic barbershop quartet, the Dapper Dans. \"In a lot of ways, it felt like my childhood dream came true.\" While Steves dream may have come true, it wasnt until he was cast in \"A Musical Celebration of Coco\" that he experienced an awakening. \"A Musical Celebration of Coco\" is a festive and colorful show that tells the story of the Disney and Pixar film with music, dance and authentic costumes, offered at Plaza de la Familia in Disney California Adventure park. \"To see a full audience of Latinos - some of them crying, some of them nodding in agreement when I talked about Dia de los Muertos [as part of the show]... Its a real authenticity that the audience has a deep, emotional connection to,\" Steve said, recalling his first time performing in the role. That moment represented a pivotal shift in Steves perspective. \"I started to see that being Latino was actually very special,\" Steve said. \"To see that I come from a culture that is so rich in tradition, life, family, art and music...I finally understood what it meant to be proud of my heritage.\" The ofrenda Steve Limones and husband James display in their home during Dia de los Muertos to honor the lives of family members who have departed From that moment forward, Steve wore his heritage as a badge of honor. \"My Spanish-speaking was kind of a superpower,\" Steve said. \"It was something that allowed me to be unique and different.\" After being inspired to learn more, Steve and his husband even began celebrating Dia de los Muertos by setting up an ofrenda, or a home altar that displays photos and special objects to honor loved ones who have been--and will forever be--part of their lives. Now when Steve thinks of his heritage, especially during Hispanic Latinx Heritage Month, he wants to continue the conversation. \"In a lot of ways, its about inclusivity,\" Steve said. \"The fact that we recognize this month raises awareness and allows people to ask questions so they can learn about different cultures and peoples and embrace the areas in which we are all alike.\" Steve Limones performing in \"The Dapper Dans\" Hispanic Latinx Heritage Month is celebrated now through Oct. 15. Disneyland Resort cast members are recognizing the month with events, panel discussions and storytelling about Hispanic and Latinx culture, representation and allyship. At the resort, guests can visit Plaza de la Familia in Disney California Adventure park, a celebration of the everlasting bonds of family and Dia de los Muertos, now through Nov. 2. Guests can also get into the spirit at their next visit to Downtown Disney District, where Latinx performing groups ranging from Mariachi and Latin pop to reggaeton can be found performing on the main stage throughout the celebration.

But recently, I learned the area is also home to a small (but mighty!) fleet of motor cruiser boats, which have been sailing those waterways since the 1970s. Now, just in time for the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World, a new cruiser has joined the fleet, and its story is pretty incredible. The cruiser is called Tradewinds, a name that was chosen by Walt Disney Imagineering and voted on by watercraft cast members. \"Trade Winds\" refers to the nearly constant wind that blows across the equator. And its the perfect name for this new vessel, since watercraft cast members have constantly delivered remarkable guest service across Bay Lake and the Seven Seas Lagoon since the fleet was launched. But the name isnt the only thing that cast members helped to choose. Watercraft cast members offered feedback that directly impacted the design of the vessel, from the position of the pilot house to the amount of cabin space available to guests. \"We solicited feedback from cast members about the things they would like to see in a new motor cruiser, and we put it into the boat,\" said Transportation Guest Experience Manager Collin Garton. \"Everything about it was made to make cast member input a reality.\" The small adjustments that make Tradewinds stand out among the other three motor cruisers in the fleet make a big difference to both the cast and the guest experience. \"Its a great addition to the fleet,\" said Billy Carter, a Transportation Engineering Services cast member who made sure everything on the boat was primed and ready to go before its launch. \"Everybody is really proud of it. I think its going to go over big time with the guests.\" Guests can identify the new motor cruiser by its bright orange, yellow, white and teal coloring - also selected by the cast. Before Tradewinds made its maiden voyage, cast members gathered together to christen the boat, a nautical tradition. Its the first new motor cruiser to join the fleet in nearly 30 years, so the excitement at the event was palpable. \"Its a big thing, and the boat looks sharp,\" Billy said. \"Everybodys done a great job on this one.\" \"This is a really big deal for our cast,\" Collin agreed. \"The last time we had an addition to our Resort fleet was 1993. The fact that we have this new vessel is huge.\" And its not just a big deal for the watercraft cast, who will be operating the cruiser each and every day. Its a big deal for the team that worked tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure Tradewinds was ready for its big debut. \"The project team on this boat has been amazing,\" said Greg Klesaris, the Facility Asset Management Project Planer in charge of Tradewinds. \"From Transportation Operations to our engineers, everyone has come together to get the job done, and its been really great getting to collaborate with all of these people.\"\\nThis fall, Walt Disney Animation Studios \"Encanto\" is set to hit screens and transport audiences from around the world into Casa Madrigal to experience the vibrant magic and sounds of Colombian culture. Ahead of the films release, we are so excited to share a specially-designed collection of \"Encanto\" products featuring art designed by Colombian artists, which highlights the beautiful history and culture of Colombia. Read on to hear from one of the talented minds behind the collection, as we continue to celebrate Hispanic Latinx Heritage Month and showcase the rich cultures and customs of the community. Carla Pereira, marketing director for Disney Parks, Experiences and Products in Latin America, played a pivotal role in bringing the \"Encanto\" collection to life. Carla collaborated with teams in the U.S. to bring in four artists from various regions in Colombia to create original artwork inspired by \"Encanto.\" Fans can celebrate the upcoming film with wearable art pieces, accessories and more, featuring these bespoke designs. The collection features artwork by artists Catalina Estrada, Sebas Pakui, Diana Ordonez (Ledania) and Johnny Nunez who each used their unique artistic styles to capture the heart of the film and its magical story of Colombian culture, music and family. \"For me, what makes this collection so special is that it shares Colombian art with the rest of the world, so they can experience it. Having something that is truly original and grounded in the art and the culture of our region is so special to me. Knowing that our fans around the world will get to experience this little piece of our rich culture is incredibly meaningful,\" Carla said. Carla and her team worked with the artists to share the parts of the film that inspired them most, while encouraging them to showcase their own experiences, unique styles and love for Colombia through their designs. The result: a colorful collection of products featuring unique textures and visuals that bring the magical world of \"Encanto\" to life. \"There is such an emotional connection between what the artists saw in \\'Encanto and how they brought that to life through their different art styles. I felt like I, as a Brazilian, had been transported to Colombia when I saw the art for the first time, which shows how Latin Americans are all so different, but we still have so many commonalities,\" Carla said. \"From family relationships, to how the colors flow through our daily lives - I really love to see those connections come out.\" Though her main role focuses on supporting product development in Latin America, Carla has always been passionate about championing diversity, equity and inclusion, and she infuses it into her work every day. Carla leads efforts to help bring more inclusive products to market, such as the recently-launched hair care line for curly and textured hair in Brazil. She remains an advocate for developing authentic products that genuinely reflect the incredible diversity of Disney fans around the world, and she feels honored to have had the opportunity to collaborate on the \"Encanto\" collection, which she said represents and celebrates Latin American culture. \"Having authentic representation not only in the movie, but in the products as well, provides a strong sense of belonging for the Colombian community. And its so meaningful because everyone can share in the culture.\" Carla noted. Learn more about the visionaries behind the collection here: The Styled with \"Encanto\" collection is now available exclusively at Target stores and on Target.com in the U.S., and will release in Colombia soon. Stay tuned for more stories highlighting Hispanic/Latinx culture as we continue to celebrate #HispanicLatinxHeritageMonth through October 15 and be sure to follow along on social media for more!\\nIts time to eat, drink, and be scary!

Documents obtained by Haugen, a former product manager at Facebook, led to a series from the Wall Street Journal that reported that Facebook commissioned studies about and knew of potential harm that it was causing from negative or inflammatory content and did not act to stop it. Among the findings cited in the report were that Instagram made body image issues worse for one in three teens. ABC News has not independently reviewed these documents, but Haugen is expected to tell the Senate subcommittee about the evidence she reportedly has that she says shows that the company intentionally ignored evidence of its potentially harmful impact. \"There were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,\" Haugen alleged on \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday. \"And Facebook over and over again chose to optimize for its own interests like making more money.\" Facebook has publicly refuted Haugen\\'s claims, pointing to investments in security that the company has made in recent years. \"Every day our teams have to balance protecting the ability of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place,\" Lena Pietsch, the director of policy communications for Facebook, said in a statement Sunday. \"To suggest we encourage bad content or do nothing is just not true.\" Nick Clegg, Facebook\\'s vice president of global affairs, said in a CNN interview on Sunday those making accusations that the company is commissioning research to \"deliberately\" brush it aside have it \"back to front.\" \"If we didn\\'t want to address those questions, we wouldn\\'t commission the research in the first place,\" Clegg said. Haugen\\'s career has included stops at Google, Pinterest and other social media companies, but she claimed what she saw at Facebook was \"substantially worse.\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who chairs the Senate Commerce subcommittee on Consumer Protections, Product Safety and Data Security, said in a tweet that he\\'s been speaking with Haugen in the lead-up to her testimony. \"From her first visit with my office, Ive admired her backbone & bravery in revealing terrible truths about one of the worlds most powerful, implacable corporate giants,\" Blumenthal said in a tweet. \"Facebooks actions make clear that we cannot trust it to police itself. We must consider stronger oversight, effective protections for children, & tools for parents, among the needed reforms.\" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, the top Republican on the Senate subcommittee that will hear from Haugen, said it has been \"fascinating\" to comb over documents that Haugen provided the committee. \"What we want to know is how much data is Facebook capturing and what are they doing with that data, how long do they keep it, are they sharing with third parties, are they getting permission when they are datamining these children,\" Blackburn said on Fox Business on Monday. It is not clear how much information Haugen has shared with the committee in advance of her testimony, but during her interview Sunday, Haugen said she took thousands of pages of documents from Facebook so that \"no one can question that this is real.\" Haugen also alleged on CBS that Facebook decided to ease safeguards put in place to stop the spread of disinformation during the 2020 election season, which she says contributed to the Jan. 6 attack on the United States Capitol. In an internal memo obtained by the New York Times, Clegg refuted that allegation as well. \"Social media has had a big impact on society in recent years, and Facebook is often a place where much of this debate plays out,\" Clegg wrote. \"But what evidence there is simply does not support the idea that Facebook, or social media more generally, is the primary cause of polarization.\" Haugen\\'s appearance before the committee Tuesday comes as part of an ongoing effort by Congress to assess how to regulate massive social media companies such as Facebook. Last week, in a hearing before the same subcommittee that Haugen will appear before, lawmakers accused Facebook of taking a page from \"big tobacco\\'s playbook\" by hiding research about what they consider to be its addictive and harmful nature. Antigone Davis, Facebook\\'s global head of safety, faced bipartisan scrutiny as she defended the company during the hearing that lasted some three hours. \"We understand that recent reporting has raised a lot of questions about our internal research, including research we do to better understand young people\\'s experiences on Instagram,\" Davis stated in written testimony. \"We strongly disagree with how this reporting characterized our work, so we want to be clear about what that research shows, and what it does not show.\" ABC News\\' Catherine Thorbecke contributed to this report\\nWhen Facebook shut down Monday, billions lost their only access to the internet. Facebook said in a blog post on Tuesday the crash was caused by an error during routine maintenance, which took down global data servers. During the outage, Facebook\\'s website and app were inaccessible, as were WhatsApp and Instagram, two of the company\\'s most popular acquisitions. While the outage was relatively brief -- around six hours -- some researchers said it points to the downsides of a growing reliance on a single company\\'s services. \"I think it speaks to the vulnerability of our dependence on these platforms,\" said Philip Roessler, a professor at William & Mary, at which he co-directs the Digital Inclusion and Governance Lab. Roessler said that in countries where he does his research -- places like Kenya and Malawi -- WhatsApp is an essential part of the communications infrastructure, especially as mobile customers take advantage of WhatsApp-dedicated bundles that are much cheaper than standard mobile data. \"It\\'s become this kind of backbone of these emerging economies,\" he said, highlighting how businesses use WhatsApp to communicate with customers and suppliers alike, while workers use it to find jobs. WhatsApp is also valuable in places without universal literacy, Roessler said, because the platform allows users to send voice-based messages. In Brazil, local broadcaster Globo reported that the outage temporarily crippled some small businesses, rendering them unable to fill orders. The implications of a growing dependence on Facebook\\'s services go beyond the economic, according to Ryan Shandler, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oxford who highlighted the role played by social media platforms in aiding free speech and assembly. \"People have become dependent on this platform to realize basic civil and human rights,\" he said. In 2014, Facebook paid $19 billion to acquire WhatsApp. The messaging app\\'s rise to prominence, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation\\'s Jon Callas, was due in part to cost. The data required to use the service, Callas said, could be cheaper than a traditional text message, also known as SMS. \"It was fantastically cheap and it was certainly as good as SMS, so lots and lots of people started using it as a replacement for that,\" Callas said. According to data from the digital analytics company Similarweb, Whatsapp is the most popular mobile messaging app in several of the world\\'s most populous countries, including India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Brazil. In July, Facebook said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that its apps had around 3.51 billion users. While the crash sparked a range of humorous responses -- Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey joked on his own platform about buying Facebook.com, which was erroneously listed as for sale during the outage -- its consequences could have been more serious, said Roessler, adding: \"If it had lasted much longer, you know, the effects would have been quite deep and severe.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
