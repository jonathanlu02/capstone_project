Alice’s Evidence\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\\n\\n\\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\\n“without pictures or conversations?”\\n\\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\nclose by her.\\n\\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\n\\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again.\\n\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\ndeep well.\\n\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\ncupboards as she fell past it.\\n\\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\\n\\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\\ngrand words to say.)\\n\\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\\n\\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\\nthe fall was over.\\n\\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\nfrom the roof.\\n\\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\nget out again.\\n\\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\n\\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\\nindeed were really impossible.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\\nletters.\\n\\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\\nsooner or later.\\n\\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\\ntelescope.”\\n\\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\\n\\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\nsat down and cried.\\n\\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\\n“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\\npeople! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\\nperson!”\\n\\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\\n\\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\\non in the common way.\\n\\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\nThe Pool of Tears\\n\\n\\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\\nChristmas.”\\n\\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\\n\\n     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\\n     Alice’s love_).\\n\\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\\n\\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\\n\\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\\n\\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\\n\\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\\n\\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\\n\\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\\n\\n“How doth the little crocodile\\n    Improve his shining tail,\\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\\n    On every golden scale!\\n\\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\\n    How neatly spread his claws,\\nAnd welcome little fishes in\\n    With gently smiling jaws!”\\n\\n\\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\\n\\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\\n\\n“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\\n\\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\\nshe was nine feet high.\\n\\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\\n\\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\nslipped in like herself.\\n\\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\\nbut it said nothing.\\n\\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\\nfright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\\ncats.”\\n\\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\\n\\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”\\n\\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\\ntail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\\nagain!”\\n\\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\\npool as it went.\\n\\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\\n\\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\\n\\n\\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\\n\\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\\n\\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\\nMercia and Northumbria—’”\\n\\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\\nyou speak?”\\n\\n“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\\n\\n“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\\n\\n“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\\n\\n“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\\nwhat ‘it’ means.”\\n\\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\\narchbishop find?”\\n\\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\\nthe crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\\nof his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\\nturning to Alice as it spoke.\\n\\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\\ndry me at all.”\\n\\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\\nremedies—”\\n\\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\\nthose long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\\ntittered audibly.\\n\\n“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\\n\\n“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\\n\\n“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)\\n\\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\\nalong the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\\n\\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\\n\\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\\n\\n“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\\nconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\\n\\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\\none a-piece, all round.\\n\\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\\n\\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\\n\\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\\n\\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\\n\\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\\ncheered.\\n\\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\\nshe could.\\n\\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\\n\\n“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\\nit is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\\nwould be offended again.\\n\\n“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\\nsighing.\\n\\n“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\\nat the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\\ntale was something like this:—\\n\\n         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\\n         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\\n         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\\n         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\\n         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\\n         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\\n         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\\n\\n“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\\nyou thinking of?”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\\nbend, I think?”\\n\\n“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\\n\\n“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\\nanxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\\n\\n“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\\nwalking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\\n\\n“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\\nyou know!”\\n\\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\\n\\n“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\\nthe others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\\n\\n“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\\nher daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\\n_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\\nsnappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\\n\\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\\naddressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\\n\\n“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\\nLory.\\n\\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\\n“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\\ncan’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\\nshe’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\\n\\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\\ncarefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\\ndoesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\\nto its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\\nbed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\\nalone.\\n\\n“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\\ntone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\\nany more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\\ncoming back to finish his story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\\n\\n\\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\\nit muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\\nmy fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\\nthey were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\\nlittle door, had vanished completely.\\n\\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\\na fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\\nmistake it had made.\\n\\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\\nplate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\\nfan and gloves.\\n\\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\\nnurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\\nif it began ordering people about like that!”\\n\\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\\nand put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\\nI’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\\n\\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\\ndrunk quite so much!”\\n\\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\\n\\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\\n\\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\\nyet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\\nwhen I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\\nsorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\\n\\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\\nnow? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\\nthen—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\\n\\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\\nlessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\\nfor any lesson-books!”\\n\\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\\n\\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\\n\\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\\ngo round and get in at the window.”\\n\\n“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\\n\\nNext came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\\nthen a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\\nfor apples, yer honour!”\\n\\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\\nhelp me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\\n\\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\\n\\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\\n\\n“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\\nwindow!”\\n\\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\\n\\n“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\\n\\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\\nall!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\\nof cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\\nthey’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\\n_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\\n\\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\\ntalking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\\nladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\\nfetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\\ntogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\\nwell enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\\nrope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\\nHeads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\\nfancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\\nit!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\\nyou’re to go down the chimney!”\\n\\n“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\\nherself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\\nI _think_ I can kick a little!”\\n\\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\\nsaying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\\nto see what would happen next.\\n\\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\\nthen the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\\nus all about it!”\\n\\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\\nAlice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\\na deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\\n\\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\\n\\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\\ncalled out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\\n\\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\\nroof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\\n\\n“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\\nthis,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\\nagain!” which produced another dead silence.\\n\\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\\nhead. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.”\\n\\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\\nsafe in a thick wood.\\n\\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\\nwandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\\nwill be the best plan.”\\n\\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\\ngreat hurry.\\n\\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\\nthing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\\nspite of all her coaxing.\\n\\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\\n\\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\\nand till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\\n\\n“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\\nleaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\\nI’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\\nquestion is, what?”\\n\\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\\nwas on the top of it.\\n\\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\\nanything else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\\n\\n\\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\\n\\n“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\\nchanged several times since then.”\\n\\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\\nyourself!”\\n\\n“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\\nnot myself, you see.”\\n\\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\\n“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.”\\n\\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\\nqueer, won’t you?”\\n\\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\\n\\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\\n\\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\\n\\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\\nstate of mind, she turned away.\\n\\n“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\\nimportant to say!”\\n\\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\\n\\n“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\\ncould.\\n\\n“No,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\\nthink you’re changed, do you?”\\n\\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\\n\\n“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\\n\\n“Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice folded her hands, and began:—\\n\\n“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\\n    “And your hair has become very white;\\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\\n    “I feared it might injure the brain;\\nBut, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\\n    Why, I do it again and again.”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\\n    “I kept all my limbs very supple\\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\\n    For anything tougher than suet;\\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\\n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\\n    And argued each case with my wife;\\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\\n    What made you so awfully clever?”\\n\\n“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\\n    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\\n    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\\n\\n\\n“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\\nwords have got altered.”\\n\\n“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\\nand there was silence for some minutes.\\n\\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\\n\\n“What size do you want to be?” it asked.\\n\\n“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\\n\\n“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\\n\\n“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\\n\\n“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\\n\\n“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\\nthought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\\noffended!”\\n\\n“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\\n\\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\\n“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\\ngrow shorter.”\\n\\n“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\\nherself.\\n\\n“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\\n\\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\\n\\n“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\\n\\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\\nlefthand bit.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\\n\\n“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my\\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”\\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\\n\\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\\n\\n“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\\n\\n“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\\n\\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing\\nseems to suit them!”\\n\\n“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\\n\\n“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\\nhedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\\nserpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\\n\\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\\n\\n“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\\n“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\\n\\n“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\\nsee its meaning.\\n\\n“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\\n\\n“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\\n\\n“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\\ninvent something!”\\n\\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\\n\\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\\ncontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\\nno use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\\ntasted an egg!”\\n\\n“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\\nchild; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\\nknow.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\\nthey’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\\n\\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\\nme whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\\n\\n“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\\n_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\\n\\n“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\\n\\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\\nand began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\\n“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\nPig and Pepper\\n\\n\\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\\nfish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\\n\\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\\nsaying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\\nQueen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\\n\\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\\n\\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\n\\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\\n\\n“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\\ntwo reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\\nare; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\\npossibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\\nnoise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\\npieces.\\n\\n“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\\n\\n“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,\\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\\nknow.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”\\nshe said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\\nshe repeated, aloud.\\n\\n“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\\n\\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\\n\\n“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\\nas if nothing had happened.\\n\\n“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\\n\\n“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\\nquestion, you know.”\\n\\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\\nIt’s enough to drive one crazy!”\\n\\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\\nremark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\\ndays and days.”\\n\\n“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\\n\\n“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\\n\\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\\n\\n“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\\n\\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\\nalternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\\n\\n“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\\nyour cat grins like that?”\\n\\n“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\\n\\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\\n\\n“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\\nknow that cats _could_ grin.”\\n\\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\\n\\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\\npleased to have got into a conversation.\\n\\n“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\\n\\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\\nthe Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\\n\\n“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\\nin an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\\noff.\\n\\n“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\\ngrowl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\\n\\n“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\\n\\n“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\\n\\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\\nbe listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\\nis it twelve? I—”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\\nfigures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\\nthe end of every line:\\n\\n“Speak roughly to your little boy,\\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\\nHe only does it to annoy,\\n    Because he knows it teases.”\\n\\n\\nCHORUS.\\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\\n\\n\\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\\n\\n\\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:—\\n\\n“I speak severely to my boy,\\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\\n    The pepper when he pleases!”\\n\\n\\nCHORUS.\\n\\n\\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\\n\\n\\n“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,\\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play\\ncroquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook\\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\\n\\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\\n“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\\n\\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\\nout into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”\\nthought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\\nmurder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\\n“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\\nexpressing yourself.”\\n\\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\\nnot like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\\nsobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\\nwere any tears.\\n\\nNo, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\\nsaid Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\\nnow!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\\n\\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\\nwith this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\\nfurther.\\n\\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\\ntrot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\\nherself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\\nrather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\\nto herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\\na tree a few yards off.\\n\\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\\n\\n“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\\nwider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.\\n“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\\n\\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\\n\\n“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\\n\\n“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\\n\\n“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.\\n\\n“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\\nenough.”\\n\\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\\nquestion. “What sort of people live about here?”\\n\\n“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\\nMarch Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”\\n\\n“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\\n\\n“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\\nYou’re mad.”\\n\\n“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\\n\\n“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\\n\\nAlice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how\\ndo you know that you’re mad?”\\n\\n“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”\\n\\n“I suppose so,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\\nand wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\\nand wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”\\n\\n“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\\nQueen to-day?”\\n\\n“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\\nyet.”\\n\\n“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\\n\\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\\nit suddenly appeared again.\\n\\n“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\\nforgotten to ask.”\\n\\n“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\\nin a natural way.\\n\\n“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\\n\\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\\nsaid to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\\nperhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\\nwas in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\\n\\n“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\\n\\n“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\\n\\n“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\\n\\n“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\\ngrin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\\n\\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\\ntimidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\\nI almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\nA Mad Tea-Party\\n\\n\\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very\\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\\nI suppose it doesn’t mind.”\\n\\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\none corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\\nAlice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\\n\\n“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\\n\\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\\n“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.\\n\\n“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\\n\\n“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\\n“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\\nmany more than three.”\\n\\n“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\\nspeech.\\n\\n“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\\nseverity; “it’s very rude.”\\n\\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\\nwas, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\\n\\n“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\\n\\n“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\\n“Exactly so,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\\n\\n“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\\nsay—that’s the same thing, you know.”\\n\\n“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well\\nsay that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\\n\\n“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\\nI get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\\n\\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\\ntalking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\\nas ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\\n\\n“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\\nwriting-desks, which wasn’t much.\\n\\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\\nis it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\\nand holding it to his ear.\\n\\nAlice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\\n\\n“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\\nthe works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\\n\\n“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.\\n\\n“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\\n“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\\n\\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\\nnothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\\nyou know.”\\n\\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\\nfunny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\\ntell what o’clock it is!”\\n\\n“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what\\nyear it is?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\\nstays the same year for such a long time together.”\\n\\n“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.\\n\\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite\\nunderstand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\\n\\n“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\\nhot tea upon its nose.\\n\\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\\neyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\\n\\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\\nagain.\\n\\n“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\\n\\n“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\\ntime,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\\nanswers.”\\n\\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\\nabout wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”\\n\\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\\ncontemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\\n\\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\\ntime when I learn music.”\\n\\n“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\\ntime for dinner!”\\n\\n(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\\n\\n“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\\nshouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\\n\\n“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.”\\n\\n“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.\\n\\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We\\nquarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing\\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert\\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\\n\\n‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\nHow I wonder what you’re at!’\\n\\n\\nYou know the song, perhaps?”\\n\\n“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\\n\\n“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\\n\\n‘Up above the world you fly,\\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\\n                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\\n\\n\\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\\n“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they\\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\\n\\n“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the\\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his\\nhead!’”\\n\\n“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\\ndo a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\\n\\nA bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\\ntea-things are put out here?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\\nand we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\\n\\n“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”\\n\\n“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured\\nto ask.\\n\\n“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\\n“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”\\n\\n“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\\nproposal.\\n\\n“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And\\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\\n\\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\\nhoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\\n\\n“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.\\n\\n“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\\nbefore it’s done.”\\n\\n“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\\nin a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\\nthey lived at the bottom of a well—”\\n\\n“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\\nin questions of eating and drinking.\\n\\n“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\n“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;\\n“they’d have been ill.”\\n\\n“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”\\n\\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But\\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?”\\n\\n“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\n\\n“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t\\ntake more.”\\n\\n“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to\\ntake _more_ than nothing.”\\n\\n“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.\\n\\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\\nrepeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\\n\\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\\nsaid, “It was a treacle-well.”\\n\\n“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\\nHatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\\nremarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I\\ndare say there may be _one_.”\\n\\n“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\\ngo on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\\nyou know—”\\n\\n“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\\n\\n“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\\n\\n“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\\non.”\\n\\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\\nmoved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\\n\\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\\ncautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\\nfrom?”\\n\\n“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\\n\\n“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\\nto notice this last remark.\\n\\n“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\\n\\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\\nsome time without interrupting it.\\n\\n“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of\\nthings—everything that begins with an M—”\\n\\n“Why with an M?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why not?” said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice was silent.\\n\\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\\nlittle shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\\nthings are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a\\ndrawing of a muchness?”\\n\\n“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\\nthink—”\\n\\n“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.\\n\\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\\nthe teapot.\\n\\n“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her\\nway through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\\nall my life!”\\n\\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\\nleading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But\\neverything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And\\nin she went.\\n\\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\\nglass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,\\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\\nand the cool fountains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\nThe Queen’s Croquet-Ground\\n\\n\\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\\none of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\\nlike that!”\\n\\n“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my\\nelbow.”\\n\\nOn which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\\nblame on others!”\\n\\n“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”\\n\\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\\n\\n“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.\\n\\n“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for\\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\\n\\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\\nthings—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\\nand all of them bowed low.\\n\\n“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are\\npainting those roses?”\\n\\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\\nvoice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\\nyou see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\\nout “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\\n\\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\\nthe King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\\n\\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\\nof such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\\nprocession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\\nfaces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\\nand waited.\\n\\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\\nat her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the\\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\n\\n“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\\nAlice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”\\n\\n“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\\nbut she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\\nall. I needn’t be afraid of them!”\\n\\n“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\\n\\n“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\\nno business of _mine_.”\\n\\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\\n\\n“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\\nsilent.\\n\\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\\ndear: she is only a child!”\\n\\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\\nthem over!”\\n\\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\\n\\n“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\\n\\n“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing\\nhere?”\\n\\n“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\\ndown on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\\n\\n“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\\n“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the\\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\\nto Alice for protection.\\n\\n“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\\nothers.\\n\\n“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\\n\\n“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\\nin reply.\\n\\n“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\\n\\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\\nevidently meant for her.\\n\\n“Yes!” shouted Alice.\\n\\n“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\\nwondering very much what would happen next.\\n\\n“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\\n\\n“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\\n\\n“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\\nsentence of execution.”\\n\\n“What for?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\\n\\n“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\\n‘What for?’”\\n\\n“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\\nscream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\\ntone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\\nQueen said—”\\n\\n“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\\n\\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\\n\\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\\nshouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\\nminute.\\n\\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\\n“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\\none left alive!”\\n\\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\\nto herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\\nto.”\\n\\n“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\nenough for it to speak with.\\n\\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\\nspeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\\nof them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\\n\\n“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\\ncomplaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\\noneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\\narch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\nground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!”\\n\\n“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\\n\\n“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\\n“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\\n\\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\\n\\n“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\\nlooking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.\\n\\n“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\\nintroduce it.”\\n\\n“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\\nkiss my hand if it likes.”\\n\\n“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.\\n\\n“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\\nthat!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.\\n\\n“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\\nbut I don’t remember where.”\\n\\n“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called\\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would\\nhave this cat removed!”\\n\\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\\nsmall. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\\n\\n“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\\nhurried off.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\\non, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\\n\\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\\n\\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\\nmatter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\\nof the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\\nfriend.\\n\\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\nwhat they said.\\n\\nThe executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\\nthing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\\n\\nThe King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\nbeheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\\n\\nThe Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in\\nless than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\\nanxious.)\\n\\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the\\nDuchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”\\n\\n“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”\\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\\n\\nThe Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\nThe Mock Turtle’s Story\\n\\n\\n“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”\\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,\\nand they walked off together.\\n\\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\\n\\n“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\\ntone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\\ndoes very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\\nhot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\\nkind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\\nthem bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\\nso stingy about it, you know—”\\n\\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\\na bit.”\\n\\n“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\\n\\n“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only\\nyou can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\\nshe spoke.\\n\\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\\nbore it as well as she could.\\n\\n“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\\nthe conversation a little.\\n\\n“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,\\n’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\\n\\n“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\\ntheir own business!”\\n\\n“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\\nsharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\\n_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\\nthemselves.’”\\n\\n“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\\nherself.\\n\\n“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”\\nthe Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”\\n\\n“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\\nto have the experiment tried.\\n\\n“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\\nthe moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\\n\\n“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\\n\\n“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\\nputting things!”\\n\\n“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\\neverything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\\nAnd the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\\nof yours.’”\\n\\n“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\\nremark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\\n\\n“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\\nis—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\\nsimply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\\notherwise.’”\\n\\n“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\\n“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\\n\\n“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\\nin a pleased tone.\\n\\n“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\\nAlice.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present\\nof everything I’ve said as yet.”\\n\\n“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give\\nbirthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out\\nloud.\\n\\n“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\\nlittle chin.\\n\\n“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\\nfeel a little worried.\\n\\n“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\\nthe m—”\\n\\nBut here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\\neven in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\\nthunderstorm.\\n\\n“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\\n\\n“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\\nground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\\nabout half no time! Take your choice!”\\n\\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\\n\\n“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\\ncroquet-ground.\\n\\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\\nwould cost them their lives.\\n\\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\\nwith the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\\nher head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\\nand under sentence of execution.\\n\\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have\\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?”\\n\\n“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”\\n\\n“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.\\n\\n“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”\\n\\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\\nto the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a\\ngood thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\\n\\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\\nyou don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy\\nthing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\\nexecutions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\\nwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\\n\\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,\\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\\n\\n“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never\\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!”\\n\\n“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\\nafter it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\\n\\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\\npitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\\nhis fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”\\n\\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\\n\\n“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\\nhistory, she do.”\\n\\n“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\\ndown, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”\\n\\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\\nherself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\\nBut she waited patiently.\\n\\n“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\\nTurtle.”\\n\\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\\noccasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\\nsaying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\\nnothing.\\n\\n“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\\nsea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\\n\\n“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.\\n\\n“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\\nangrily: “really you are very dull!”\\n\\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\\nquestion,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all\\nday about it!” and he went on in these words:\\n\\n“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\\n\\n“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.\\n\\n“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\\n\\n“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\\n\\n“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so\\nproud as all that.”\\n\\n“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”\\n\\n“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.\\n\\n“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a\\ntone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\\n‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\\n\\n“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\\nof the sea.”\\n\\n“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I\\nonly took the regular course.”\\n\\n“What was that?” inquired Alice.\\n\\n“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\\nreplied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.”\\n\\n“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”\\n\\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of\\nuglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\\n\\n“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.”\\n\\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\\n\\n“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\\nsubjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\\nSeaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\\nFainting in Coils.”\\n\\n“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\\n\\n“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,\\nthough. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”\\n\\n“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.”\\n\\n“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\\n\\n“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\\nto change the subject.\\n\\n“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\\non.”\\n\\n“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\\n“because they lessen from day to day.”\\n\\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\\nbefore she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been\\na holiday?”\\n\\n“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.\\n\\n“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\\ndecided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\nThe Lobster Quadrille\\n\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\\ntwo sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:—\\n\\n“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\\nAlice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\\n(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\\nsaid “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\\nLobster Quadrille is!”\\n\\n“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\\n\\n“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\\nsea-shore—”\\n\\n“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\\nthen, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\\n\\n“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\\n\\n“—you advance twice—”\\n\\n“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\\n\\n“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\\n\\n“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\\n\\n“—as far out to sea as you can—”\\n\\n“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\\nabout.\\n\\n“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\\n\\n“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\\n\\n“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.\\n\\n“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Very much indeed,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\\nGryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”\\n\\n“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”\\n\\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\\nand sadly:—\\n\\n“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\\n“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\\nThey are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?\\n\\n“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\\nBut the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\\n\\n“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.\\n“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France—\\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\\ncurious song about the whiting!”\\n\\n“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,\\nof course?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself\\nhastily.\\n\\n“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\\nseen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\\n\\n“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in\\ntheir mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\\n\\n“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\\nand the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\\neyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.\\n\\n“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\\ncouldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\\nabout a whiting before.”\\n\\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you\\nknow why it’s called a whiting?”\\n\\n“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\\n\\n“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\\n\\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\\nin a wondering tone.\\n\\n“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\\nmakes them so shiny?”\\n\\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\\nanswer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\\n\\n“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\\n“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”\\n\\n“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\\n\\n“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\\n“any shrimp could have told you that.”\\n\\n“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\\nrunning on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,\\nplease: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”\\n\\n“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\\n\\n“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\\n\\n“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,\\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\\n\\n“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\\n\\n“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\\nthe Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\\n\\n“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\\nAlice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\\nbecause I was a different person then.”\\n\\n“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\\n“explanations take such a dreadful time.”\\n\\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\\nabout her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\\n\\n“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\\n\\n“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I\\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\\nbegin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\\nauthority over Alice.\\n\\n“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the\\nGryphon.\\n\\n“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”\\nthought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got\\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\\nvery queer indeed:—\\n\\n“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\\n“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”\\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”\\n\\n[later editions continued as follows\\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\\n\\n\\n“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said\\nthe Gryphon.\\n\\n“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds\\nuncommon nonsense.”\\n\\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\\n\\n“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next\\nverse.”\\n\\n“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn\\nthem out with his nose, you know?”\\n\\n“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully\\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\\n\\n“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it\\nbegins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”\\n\\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—\\n\\n“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”\\n\\n[later editions continued as follows\\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\\nAnd concluded the banquet—]\\n\\n\\n“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle\\ninterrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the\\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”\\n\\n“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was\\nonly too glad to do so.\\n\\n“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon\\nwent on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”\\n\\n“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice\\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\\n“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old\\nfellow?”\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\\nwith sobs, to sing this:—\\n\\n“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\n\\n“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\\nGame, or any other dish?\\nWho would not give all else for two p\\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\nPennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”\\n\\n\\n“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\\nto repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the\\ndistance.\\n\\n“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.\\n\\n“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\\nanswered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—\\n\\n“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\nWho Stole the Tarts?\\n\\n\\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little\\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d\\nget the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”\\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\\neverything about her, to pass away the time.\\n\\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\\nthe name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to\\nherself, “because of his great wig.”\\n\\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\\n\\n“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\\n(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\\nanimals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She\\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”\\nwould have done just as well.\\n\\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are\\nthey doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything\\nto put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”\\n\\n“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\\n“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”\\n\\n“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the\\ncourt!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\\nto make out who was talking.\\n\\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\\nthat all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,\\nand she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell\\n“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice\\nmuddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.\\n\\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\\n\\n“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.\\n\\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—\\n\\n“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\\n    All on a summer day:\\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\\n    And took them quite away!”\\n\\n\\n“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.\\n\\n“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great\\ndeal to come before that!”\\n\\n“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\\nthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”\\n\\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your\\nMajesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished\\nmy tea when I was sent for.”\\n\\n“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”\\n\\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\\nwas,” he said.\\n\\n“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.\\n\\n“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\\n\\n“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.\\n\\n“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\\na memorandum of the fact.\\n\\n“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none\\nof my own. I’m a hatter.”\\n\\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll\\nhave you executed on the spot.”\\n\\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\\nbread-and-butter.\\n\\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\\nas long as there was room for her.\\n\\n“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\\nnext to her. “I can hardly breathe.”\\n\\n“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\\n\\n“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.\\n\\n“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing\\ntoo.”\\n\\n“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\\nthat ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\\nto the other side of the court.\\n\\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\\nof the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”\\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\\noff.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you\\nexecuted, whether you’re nervous or not.”\\n\\n“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\\n“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the\\nbread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”\\n\\n“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.\\n\\n“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.\\n\\n“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you\\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!”\\n\\n“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\\nthat—only the March Hare said—”\\n\\n“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\\n\\n“You did!” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\\n\\n“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\\nnothing, being fast asleep.\\n\\n“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\\n\\n“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.\\n\\n“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\\n\\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\\ndown on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.\\n\\n“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.\\n\\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\\n\\n“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in\\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at\\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\\ncourt,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”\\n\\n“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the\\nKing.\\n\\n“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”\\n\\n“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.\\n\\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\\n\\n“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get\\non better.”\\n\\n“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\\n\\n“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\\n\\n“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\\nto the door.\\n\\n“Call the next witness!” said the King.\\n\\nThe next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” said the King.\\n\\n“Shan’t,” said the cook.\\n\\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\\n“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”\\n\\n“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”\\n\\n“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.\\n\\n“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.\\n\\n“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!\\nTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\\nwhiskers!”\\n\\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the\\nnext witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my\\ndear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my\\nforehead ache!”\\n\\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they\\nhaven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her\\nsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\\nlittle voice, the name “Alice!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\nAlice’s Evidence\\n\\n\\n“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\\ngoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\\n\\n“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\\nof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\\nidea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\\njury-box, or they would die.\\n\\n“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until\\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated\\nwith great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\\n\\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\\ngot it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she\\nsaid to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\\ntrial one way up as the other.”\\n\\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\ncourt.\\n\\n“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.\\n\\n“Nothing,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.\\n\\n“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.\\n\\n“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were\\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\\nRabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he\\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\\nhe spoke.\\n\\n“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\\nto himself in an undertone,\\n\\n“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying\\nwhich word sounded best.\\n\\nSome of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”\\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\\n“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.\\n\\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\\nhis note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule\\nForty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”\\n\\nEverybody looked at Alice.\\n\\n“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.\\n\\n“You are,” said the King.\\n\\n“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.\\n\\n“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a\\nregular rule: you invented it just now.”\\n\\n“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.\\n\\n“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.\\n\\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your\\nverdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\\n\\n“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been\\npicked up.”\\n\\n“What’s in it?” said the Queen.\\n\\n“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a\\nletter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”\\n\\n“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\\nnobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”\\n\\n“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.\\n\\n“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s\\nnothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\\nand added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”\\n\\n“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.\\n\\n“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\\nthing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)\\n\\n“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury\\nall brightened up again.)\\n\\n“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\\ncan’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”\\n\\n“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\\nworse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\\nyour name like an honest man.”\\n\\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\\nclever thing the King had said that day.\\n\\n“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.\\n\\n“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know\\nwhat they’re about!”\\n\\n“Read them,” said the King.\\n\\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please\\nyour Majesty?” he asked.\\n\\n“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you\\ncome to the end: then stop.”\\n\\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:—\\n\\n“They told me you had been to her,\\n    And mentioned me to him:\\nShe gave me a good character,\\n    But said I could not swim.\\n\\nHe sent them word I had not gone\\n    (We know it to be true):\\nIf she should push the matter on,\\n    What would become of you?\\n\\nI gave her one, they gave him two,\\n    You gave us three or more;\\nThey all returned from him to you,\\n    Though they were mine before.\\n\\nIf I or she should chance to be\\n    Involved in this affair,\\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\\n    Exactly as we were.\\n\\nMy notion was that you had been\\n    (Before she had this fit)\\nAn obstacle that came between\\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\\n\\nDon’t let him know she liked them best,\\n    For this must ever be\\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\\n    Between yourself and me.”\\n\\n\\n“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the\\nKing, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”\\n\\n“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so\\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\\ninterrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s\\nan atom of meaning in it.”\\n\\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s\\nan atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the\\npaper.\\n\\n“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\\ntrouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t\\nknow,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\\nthem with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\\n“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning\\nto the Knave.\\n\\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he\\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\\n\\n“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\\nverses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\\ncourse—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he\\ndid with the tarts, you know—”\\n\\n“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\\ntarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\\nagain—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\\nthink?” he said to the Queen.\\n\\n“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\\nas it lasted.)\\n\\n“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the\\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\\n\\n“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\\nlaughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for\\nabout the twentieth time that day.\\n\\n“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\\n\\n“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the\\nsentence first!”\\n\\n“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.\\n\\n“I won’t!” said Alice.\\n\\n“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\\nmoved.\\n\\n“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\\nthis time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\\n\\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\\n\\n“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\\nhad!”\\n\\n“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\\n\\n\\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\\nand this was her dream:—\\n\\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\\nlooking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\\nstrange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\\n\\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\\nwas sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\naround it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\nLizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\nTurtle.\\n\\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\nwould change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\\nTurtle’s heavy sobs.\\n\\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\\ndays.\\n\\nTHE END\\n ======================================================================================\\n\\nMARLIN\\nWow.\\n\\nCORAL\\nMmm.\\n\\nMARLIN\\nWow.\\n\\nCORAL\\nMmm-hmm.\\n\\nMARLIN\\nWow.\\n\\nCORAL\\nYes, Marlin.

And you\\'re lucky I don\\'t tell your parents you were out\\nthere.\\nYou know you can\\'t swim well.\\n\\nNEMO\\nI can swim fine, dad, okay?\\n\\nMARLIN\\nNo, it\\'s not okay. You shouldn\\'t be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You\\'ll start school\\nin a year or two.\\n\\nNEMO\\nNo, dad! Just because you\\'re scared of the ocean--\\n\\nMARLIN\\nClearly, you\\'re not ready. And you\\'re not coming back until you are. You think you can do\\nthese\\nthings but you just can\\'t, Nemo!\\n\\nNEMO\\nI hate you.\\n\\nMR. RAY\\nThere\\'s--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a\\nscientist, sir. Is there any problem?\\n\\nMARLIN\\nI\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t mean to interrupt things.

But you have a large class and he can get lost\\nfrom sight if you\\'re not looking. I\\'m not saying you\\'re not looking--\\n\\nFISH KID\\nOh my gosh! Nemo\\'s swimming out to sea!\\n\\nMARLIN\\nNemo! What do you think you\\'re doing? You\\'re gonna get stuck out there and I\\'ll have to get\\nyou before another fish does! Get back here!

See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.\\n\\nMARLIN\\nShort-term memory loss..I don\\'t believe this!\\n\\nDORY\\nNo, it\\'s true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think\\nit does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?\\n\\nMARLIN\\nSomething\\'s wrong with you, really. You\\'re wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps]\\n\\nBRUCE\\nHello.\\n\\nDORY\\nWell, hi!\\n\\nBRUCE\\nName\\'s Bruce. It\\'s all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right?

Hello, my name is Bruce.\\n\\nANCHOR/CHUM\\nHello, Bruce.\\n\\nBRUCE\\nIt has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and\\nmade into soup.\\n\\nCHUM\\nYou\\'re an inspiration to all of us.\\n\\nANCHOR\\nAmen.\\n\\nBRUCE\\nRight, then.

I was a little vague on the details.\\n\\nSQUIRT\\nSo where are you going?\\n\\nMARLIN\\nWell, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me.\\n\\nTURTLE KIDS\\n[gasp]\\n\\nDORY\\nNo way.\\n\\nSQUIRT\\nWhat happened?\\n\\nMARLIN\\nNo, no, no, kids. I don\\'t wanna talk about it.\\n\\nTURTLE KIDS\\nAwww! Please?\\n\\nSQUIRT\\nPleeeease?\\n\\nMARLIN\\n[sighs] Well, okay. I live on this reef, a long long way from here.\\n\\nDORY\\nOh, boy. This is gonna be good, I can tell.\\n\\nMARLIN\\nAnd my son,   Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn\\'t have done it if I hadn\\'t been\\nso tough on   him, I don\\'t know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when\\nhe was out   there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast.\\nSo we swam   out in the ocean to follow them...\\n\\nTURTLE KID\\nThey couldn\\'t stop them. And then Nemo\\'s dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..\\n\\nSMALL FISH\\n..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin\\' them up!\\n\\nBIG FISH\\nGolly, that\\'s amazing!\\n\\nSMALL FISH\\nAnd then dives thousands of..\\n\\nLOBSTER\\n..feet straight down into the dark. It\\'s like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing.\\nHow\\'s it goin\\', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..\\n\\nSWORDFISH\\n..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.\\nAnd then he has to blast his way...\\n\\nDOLPHIN\\nSo, these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian\\nCurrent.\\n\\nFEMALE BIRD\\nWhich means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..\\n\\nMALE BIRD 1\\n..Harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy\\'s gonna stop at..\\n\\n                                               36\\n\\nMALE BIRD 2\\n..nothing until he finds his son.

The words Walt Disney Pictures present and then Mulan and the dragon symbol appear. The painting becomes animated, and a Chinese soldier walks around his post. Suddenly, a bird of prey hits the back of his head ...\\nSoldier:\\nAh! [The hawk lets out a call. The soldier walks over to the edge of the wall. A hook comes flying up, followed by many more.]\\nSoldier:\\n[Running back to his post] We\\'re under attack! Light the signal!\\nThe door opens, revealing a couple of Huns. The soldier climbs up the ladder.\\nSoldier:\\n[lighting the signal with a torch, while staring at the Hun leader; other signals go on all the way along the Great Wall] Now all of China knows you\\'re here.\\nShan Yu:\\n[picking up a flag and toasting it in the signal fire] Perfect.\\n***\\n\\nThe Chinese General and two soldiers walk into the Emperor\\'s chamber and bow.\\nGeneral:\\nYour Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern Border.\\nChi Fu:\\nImpossible! No one can get through the Great Wall! [He is silenced with a raised hand from the Emperor]\\nGeneral:\\nShan Yu is leading them. We\\'ll set up defenses around your palace immediately.\\nEmperor:\\nNo! [Standing up] Send your troops to protect my people! Chi Fu!\\nChi Fu:\\nYes, your Highness.\\nEmperor:\\nDeliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces. Call up reserves, and as many new recruits as possible.\\nGeneral:\\nForgive me, your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him.\\nEmperor:\\nI won\\'t take any chances, General. A single grain of rice can tip the scale; one man may be the difference between victory and defeat.\\n***\\n\\nMulan:\\n[Using chopsticks to balance a grain of rice]\\nQuiet and demure ... graceful, polite, delicate, refined, poised ...\\n[she picks up a paintbrush and makes a mark on her arm] ... punctual!\\n[A rooster crows] Aaiee!\\n[Blowing on her arm] Little brother!

Can you help me with my chores today? [she ties a sack of chicken feed to his back, complete with a pole and a bone attached. Little Brother immediately chases the bone, running promptly into a wall and then out the door, scattering grain everywhere.]\\nFa Zu:\\n[praying] Honorable Ancestors ... please help Mulan impress the Matchmaker today. [Little Brother, followed by a herd of chickens, bursts into the family temple.] Please, please help her.\\nMulan:\\nFather, I brought you some ... Whoop! [bangs into Fa Zu, he catches the tea pot on his cane while the cups hit the ground and shatter]\\nFa Zu:\\nMulan ...\\nMulan:\\nI brought a spare!\\nFa Zu:\\nMulan ...\\nMulan:\\nRemember, the doctor said three cups of tea in the morning ...\\nFa Zu:\\nMulan.\\nMulan:\\n... and three at night.\\nFa Zu:\\nMulan.

[Holds up a wicker cage with a cricket inside.] This is your chance to prove yourself. [She closes her eyes and steps off the sidewalk.]\\nFa Li:\\nGrandma! No!\\nGranny Fa walks across the street; vehicles crash, but she emerges unharmed.\\nGranny Fa:\\nYup! This cricket\\'s a lucky one! [Fa Li sighs.]\\nMulan comes riding up on Khan, and hops off.\\nMulan:\\nI\\'m here! [looks at her mother] What? But, Mama, I had to--\\nFa Li:\\nNone of your excuses. Now, let\\'s get you cleaned up.\\nBegin \"Honor to us all\"\\nWoman #1:\\nThis is what you give me to work with?\\nWell, honey, I\\'ve seen worse.\\nWe\\'re going to turn this sow\\'s ear\\nInto a silk purse.\\nMulan:\\nIt\\'s freezing!\\nFa Li:\\nIt would\\'ve been warm, if you were here on time.\\nWoman #1:\\nWe\\'ll have you, washed and dried\\nPrimped and polished till you glow with pride\\nJust my recipe for instant bride\\nYou\\'ll bring honor to us all.\\nFa Li:\\nMulan, what\\'s this?\\nMulan:\\nUh ... notes ... in case I forget something.\\nGranny Fa:\\nHold this.

An apple for serenity\\nA pendant for balance\\nBeads of jade for beauty\\nYou must proudly show it\\nNow, add a cricket, just for luck,\\nAnd even you can\\'t blow it!\\nMulan:\\nAncestors, hear my plea,\\nPlease don\\'t let me make a fool of me\\nAnd to not uproot my family tree\\nKeep my father standing tall.\\nScarier than the Undertaker,\\nWe are meeting our matchmaker!\\nDestiny, guard our girls,\\nHelp our future as it fast unfurls\\nPlease look kindly on these cultured pearls\\nEach a perfect porcelain doll ...\\nPlease bring honor to us\\nPlease bring honor to us\\nPlease bring honor to us\\nPlease bring honor to us\\nPlease bring honor to us all!\\n\\nMatchmaker:\\nFa Mulan?\\nMulan:\\nPresent!\\nMatchmaker:\\nSpeaking without permission ...\\nMulan:\\nOops ... [They go inside]\\nGranny Fa:\\n[to Fa Li] Who spit in her bean curd?\\nMatchmaker:\\nToo skinny ... not good for bearing sons.\\nCrickee hops out of his cage, Mulan frantically tries to put him back in.\\nMatchmaker:\\nRecite the Final Admonition.\\nMulan:\\nMmm-hmm-hmm ... [pulls out a paper fan and spits Crickee out]\\nMatchmaker:\\nWell?\\nMulan:\\nFulfill your duties, calmly and ... [glances down at the crib notes written on her arm, which are smeared slightly] respectively. Um, reflect before you ... snack. Act! This shall bring you honor and glory. [She fans herself, the matchmaker grabs the fan and searches it for cheat notes. Finding none, she grabs Mulan by the arm (where the notes are!) and pulls her toward a table. The writing comes off in her hand.]\\nMatchmaker:\\nThis way. Now, pour the tea. To please your future in-laws, you must demonstrate a sense of dignity [she rubs her hand over her mouth, and the ink rubs off with a squeak] and refinement. You must also be poised. [Mulan, staring at the Matchmaker, pours the tea but misses the cup, then regains her composure and quickly fills the teacup.]\\nMulan notices Crickee relaxing happily in the tea. The Matchmaker takes the teacup.\\nMulan:\\nUm, pardon me ...\\nMatchmaker:\\nAnd silent! [sniffs the tea] Ah ...\\nMulan:\\nCould I just take that back? One moment ... [She grabs for the cup]\\nThe Matchmaker fights for the teacup, and they both fall back, the tea spilling all over the Matchmaker. Crickee hops down her dress.\\nMatchmaker:\\nWhy, you clumsy! ... Oh! Ah! Woo! [She trips over the fire-pot, spilling the coals and then sitting on them, the bottom of her dress smoking. Mulan desperately fans the burned spot, and it bursts into flames. The matchmaker runs around screaming.]\\nOutside\\nGranny Fa:\\n[To Fa Li] I think it\\'s going well, don\\'t you?\\nThe matchmaker runs outside, screaming.\\nMatchmaker:\\nPut it out! Put it out! PUT IT OUT! [Mulan throws tea over her, putting out the fire. Embarrassed, she hands the teapot to the Matchmaker and quickly walks toward Fa Li and Granny Fa.]\\nMatchmaker:\\n[furious] You are a DISGRACE! You may look like a bride, but you will NEVER bring your family honor!\\nPeople start to walk away, whispering.\\nAt the Fa farm\\nMulan is greeted with a warm smile by her father, but, humiliated, she turns away and takes Khan to the stable.\\n\\nBeginning of \"Reflection\"\\n\\nMulan:\\nLook at me ... I will never pass for a perfect bride\\nOr a perfect daughter\\nCan it be?\\nI\\'m not meant to play this part?\\nNow I see\\nThat if I were truly to be myself\\nI would break my family\\'s heart.\\nWho is that girl I see\\nStaring straight back at me\\nWhy is my reflection someone I don\\'t know\\nSomehow I cannot hide\\nWho I am, though I\\'ve tried\\nWhen will my reflection show\\nWho I am inside?\\nWhen will my reflection show\\nWho I am, inside?\\n\\nFa Zu:\\nMy, my, what beautiful blossoms we have this year. But look, this one\\'s late. I bet when it blooms, it will be the most beautiful of all.\\nDrums sound\\nMulan:\\nWhat is it?\\nImperial soldiers and Chi Fu come riding over a hill.\\nFa Li:\\nMulan, stay inside.\\nGranny Fa:\\nAhem. [points toward a low roof. Mulan runs over to it and peers over the roof]\\nChi Fu:\\nCitizens! I bring a proclamation from the Imperial City! The Huns have invaded China! By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in the Imperial Army. [Reading from list] The Chow Family! The Yee Family!\\nSon:\\nI will serve the Emperor in my father\\'s place.\\nChi Fhou:\\nThe Fa Family!\\nMulan:\\nNo!\\nHer father walks over to Chi Fu.\\nFa Zhou:\\nI am ready to serve the Emperor.\\nMulan:\\nFather, you can\\'t go!\\nFa Zhou:\\nMulan!\\nMulan:\\n[To Chi Fu] Please, sir, my father has already fought for--\\nChi Fu:\\nSilence! You will do well to teach your daughter to hold her tongue in a man\\'s presence.\\nFa Zhou:\\nMulan. You dishonor me.\\nChi Fu:\\nReport tomorrow at the Moo-Shung Camp. [He hands Fa Zu a scroll.]\\nFa Zhou:\\nYes, sir.\\nChi Fu:\\n[Continues to read] The Chu Family! The Chang Family! The Yong Family!\\nIn Fa Zhou\\'s bedroom\\nFa Zhou yanks open his closet, revealing a suit of Chinese armor, and unsheaths a sword. Mulan watches. He practices techniques, but his leg gives out and he falls against a pillar, panting.\\n\\nAt dinner\\n\\nMulan pours the tea, then sets her cup down with a bang.\\n\\nMulan:\\nYou shouldn\\'t have to go!\\nFa Li:\\nMulan!\\nMulan:\\nThere are plenty of young men to fight for China!\\nFa Zhou:\\nIt is an honor to protect my country and my family.\\nMulan:\\nSo you\\'ll die for honor.\\nFa Zhou:\\nI will die doing what\\'s right.\\nMulan:\\nBut if you ...\\nFa Zhou:\\nI know my place. It is time you learned yours.\\nMulan stares at her father for a moment, then runs outside crying.\\nMulan is sitting in a statue of a dragon, crying. It is raining. Through the window of her house, she can see her mother and father talking. Fa Zhou picks up the candle and blows it out. Mulan thinks for a minute, then makes her decision.\\n\\nMulan walks into the Family Temple and lights a stick, placing it in a hanging statue of a small dragon. She runs into her parent\\'s room, taking the scroll and leaving her hair comb. Taking her father\\'s sword, she cuts her hair short and puts on her father\\'s armor. Going out to the stable, she mounts Khan and sets off for the army.\\n\\nThe eyes of a statue in the temple flash, and Granny Fa wakes up.\\n\\nGranny Fa:\\nMulan is gone!\\nFa Zhou:\\nWhat? It can\\'t be ... [He runs outside] Mulan! No ...\\nFa Li:\\nYou must go after her. She could be killed.\\nFa Zhou:\\nIf I reveal her, she will be.\\nGranny Fa:\\nAncestors, hear our prayer. Watch over Mulan.\\nIn the Family Temple, the characters on a tombstone light up, and they turn into the Great Ancestor.\\nGreat Ancestor:\\n[To the small hanging dragon statue] Mushu, awaken.\\nThe statue shakes and smokes.\\nMushu:\\nI live! So, tell me, what mortal needs my protection, Great Ancestor. You just say the word, and I\\'m there.\\nGreat Ancestor:\\nMushu ...\\nMushu:\\nAnd lemme say something, anyone who\\'s foolish enough to threaten OUR family, vengeance will be MINE! Grr ... arrgh ...\\nGreat Ancestor:\\nMushu! These are the family guardians. They ...\\nMushu:\\nProtect the family.\\nGreat Ancestor:\\nAnd you, O Demoted One ...\\nMushu:\\nI ring the gong.\\nGreat Ancestor:\\nThat\\'s right. Now, wake up the Ancestors ...\\nMushu:\\nOne family reunion coming right up. Okay, people, people, look alive! Let\\'s go, c\\'mon, get up! Let\\'s move it! Rise and shine! Y\\'all way past the beauty sleep thing.\\nAncestor #1:\\nI knew it, I knew it. That Mulan was a troublemaker from the start.\\nAncestor #2:\\nDon\\'t look at me, she gets it from your side of the family!\\nAncestor #3:\\nShe\\'s just trying to help her father!\\nAncestor #4:\\nBut if she\\'s discovered, Fa Zu will be forever shamed. Dishonor will come to the family. Traditional values will disintegrate!\\nAncestor #5:\\nNot to mention they\\'ll lose the farm!\\nAncestor #1:\\nMy children never caused such trouble; they all became acupuncturists!\\nAncestor #2:\\nWell, we can\\'t all be acupuncturists!\\nAncestor #6:\\nNo! Your great-granddaughter had to be a CROSS-DRESSER!\\nThe Ancestors start to argue\\nAncestor #7:\\nLet a guardian bring her back!\\nAncestor #2:\\nYes! Awaken the most cunning!\\nAncestor #4:\\nNo! The swiftest!\\nAncestor #8:\\nNo, send the wisest!\\nGreat Ancestor:\\nSILENCE! We will send the most powerful of all.\\nMushu:\\n[laughs] Okay, okay, I get the Jif. I\\'ll go.\\nLaughter\\nMushu:\\nWell, y\\'all don\\'t think I can do it! Watch this here! [Blows a tiny flame] Ah-hah! Jump back, I\\'m pretty hot. But I don\\'t have to singe nobody to prove no point.\\nGreat Ancestor:\\nYou had your chance to protect the Fa Family.\\nAncestor #6:\\nYour misguidance led Fa Thang to disaster!\\nFa Thang:\\nYeah, thanks a lot.\\nMushu:\\nAnd your point is?\\nGreat Ancestor:\\nThe point is, we will be sending a REAL dragon to retrieve Mulan.\\nMulan:\\nWhat? What? I\\'m a real dragon!\\nGreat Ancestor:\\nYou\\'re not even worthy of this thought! Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon!\\nMushu:\\nSo you\\'ll get back to me on the job thing. [He is hit in the face with his gong.]\\nMushu:\\nJust one chance. Is that too much to ask? I mean, it\\'s not like it\\'ll kill you. [To the dragon statue] Yo, Rocky, wake up! You gotta go fetch Mulan! C\\'mon, boy! Go get her! Go on! C\\'mon! [He climbs up on the statue, dragging the gong.] Grr ... arrgh. Grr. Hello? Helloooo? HELLO! [He hits the ear of the dragon with the gong, and it falls off. Suddenly, the entire statue falls apart.] Uh-oh ...\\nMushu:\\nUh ... Stoney? Stoney ... Oh, man, they\\'re gonna kill me!\\nGreat Ancestor:\\nGreat Stone Dragon! Have you awakened?\\nMushu:\\n[Holding up the head of the Great Stone Dragon] Uh, yes, I just woke up! Um, I am the Great Stone Dragon! Good morning! I will go forth and fetch Mulan! Did- did I mention that I am the Great Stone Dragon?\\nGreat Ancestor:\\nGo! The fate of the Fa family rests in your claws.\\nMushu:\\nDon\\'t even worry about it. I will not lose face. [He loses his balance and tumbles down the hill, the dragon head landing on top of him.] Ow, ah, my elbow. Oh, oh, I know I twisted something. [He lifts the head off.] That\\'s just great, now what? I\\'m doomed, and all because Ms. Man decided to take a little drag show on the road.\\nCrickee:\\nChirp.\\nMushu:\\nGo GET her! What\\'s the matter with you? After this Great Stone Humptey Dumptey mess, I\\'d have to bring her back with a medal to get back in the Temple! Waitaminute! That\\'s it! I make Mulan a war hero, and they\\'ll be begging me to come back to work! That\\'s the master plan! Oh, you\\'ve done it now, man.\\nCrickee:\\nChirp.\\nMushu:\\n[running] And what makes you think you\\'re coming?\\nCrickee:\\nChirp.\\nMushu:\\nYou\\'re LUCKY? Do I look like a sucker to you?\\nCrickee:\\nChirp.\\nMushu:\\nWhat do you mean, a loser? What if I pop one of you antennae of and throw it across the yard, then who\\'s the loser, or me?\\nCrickee:\\nChirp.\\nMushu chases him out of the yard and down the road.\\nThe Hun army comes to a stop by a marsh. Two Chinese soldiers are dragged out of a tree and thrown before Shan Yu.\\nHun:\\nImperial Scouts.\\nSoldier #1:\\nShan Yu!\\nShan Yu:\\nNice work, gentlemen. You\\'ve found the Hun army.\\nLaughter\\nSoldier #2:\\nThe Emperor will stop you.\\nShan Yu:\\nStop me! He invited me. By building his wall, he challenged my strength. Well, I\\'m here to play his game. Go! Tell your Emperor to send his strongest armies. I\\'m ready.\\nThe two soldiers scurry off, one after the other.\\nShan Yu:\\nHow many men does it take to deliver a message?\\nHun Archer:\\nOne.\\n***\\n\\nMulan:\\nOkay. Okay, how about this: [in a deep voice] Excuse me, where do I sign in? Ah, I see you have a sword. I have one, too. They\\'re very manly, and strong. [She fumbles with the sword, dropping it on the ground.]\\nKhan rolls with laughter, and is hit by a shoe.\\nMulan:\\nI\\'m working on it! Oh, who am I fooling. It\\'d take a miracle to get me into the army.\\nMushu:\\n[covered in smoke, and surrounded by fire, all Mulan can see is his giant shadow.] Did I hear someone ask for a miracle! Lemme hear ya say, \"Aaah!\"\\nMulan:\\nAughhh!\\nMushu:\\nThat\\'s close enough!\\nMulan:\\nA ghost!\\nMushu:\\nGet ready, Mulan, your seventeen halation is at hand, for I have been sent by your ancestors to guide you through your masquerade! [He glances down at Crickee, who is making finger-shadows of a dragon\\'s head, and kicks him.] C\\'mon, you\\'re gonna stay, you\\'re gonna work with me. [To Mulan] So heed my words, cause if the army finds out you\\'re a girl, the penalty is death.\\nMulan:\\nWho are you?\\nMushu:\\nWho am I? WHO am I? I am the guardian of lost souls! I am the powerful, the pleasurable, the indestructible Mushu.\\nMulan stares at the tiny dragon for a moment.\\nMushu:\\nAh, I\\'m pretty hot, huh? [Immediately Khan steps all over him.]\\nMulan:\\nMy ancestors sent a little lizard to help me?\\nMushu:\\nHey, dragon, dragon, not lizard. I don\\'t do that tongue-thing.\\nMulan:\\nYou\\'re ... um ...\\nMushu:\\nIntimidating? All inspiring?\\nMulan:\\nTiny!\\nMushu:\\nOf course! I am travel-sized, for your convenience. If I was my REAL size, your cow here would die of fright. [Khan tries to chomp him.] DOWN, Bessy. My powers are beyond your mortal imagination. For instance, my eyes can see straight through your armor. Alright! That\\'s it! Dishonor! Dishonor on your whole family! Make a note of this. Dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow, dis-\\nMulan:\\nStop! I\\'m sorry! I\\'m sorry. I\\'m just nervous. I\\'ve never done this before.\\nMushu:\\nThen you\\'re gonna have to trust me. And don\\'t you slap me no more. You clear on that? [Mulan nods]. Alright. Okey-dokey! Let\\'s get this show on the road! Crickee, get the bags! [To Khan] Let\\'s move it heifer!\\nAt the Moo-Shung Camp\\nMushu:\\nOkay, this is it! Time to show them your man-walk. Shoulders back, chest high, feet apart, head up, and strut! Two three, break that bone, two, three, and work it!\\nMushu:\\n[They pass men trimming their toenails and picking their noses] Beautiful, isn\\'t it.\\nMulan:\\nThey\\'re disgusting.\\nMushu:\\nNo, they\\'re men. And you\\'re gonna have to act just like them, so pay attention.\\nRecruit:\\nLook! This tattoo will protect me from harm!\\nYow:\\nHmmm ... [punches the recruit]\\nLing:\\n[laughing] I hope you can get your money back!\\nMulan:\\nI don\\'t think I can do this ...\\nMushu:\\nIt\\'s all attitude! Be tough, like this guy here!\\nYow:\\n[spits] What are you looking at?\\nMushu:\\nPunch him. It\\'s how men say hello. [Mulan punches Yow; he slams into Chien Po.]\\nChien Po:\\nOh, Yow! You\\'ve made a friend!\\nMushu:\\nGood. Now slap him on the behind. They like that. (Mulan slaps Yow.)\\nYao:\\nWoo hoo ... I\\'m gonna hit you so hard, it\\'ll make your ancestors dizzy.\\nChien Po:\\n[picks up Yow] Yow, relax and chant with me.\\nYao:\\nerrrrrgh ....\\nChien Po:\\nnanuami tofu dah ...\\nYao:\\nnonuamitofudah.\\nChien Po:\\nFeel better?\\nYao:\\nnrrgh. Ah, you ain\\'t worth my time. Chicken boy.\\nMushu:\\nChicken boy!? Say that to my face, you limp noodle!\\nYao:\\nRrraaaaghhh! [Grabs Mulan and punches; she ducks and he punches Ling three times.] Oh, sorry Ling. Hey! [reaches down to catch Mulan from crawling away, and Ling kicks him into Chien Po, then attacks with a flying side kick. They start fighting, with Chien Po swiping to get them off. Mulan scrambles away.]\\nLing:\\nHey! There he goes! [They chase Mulan through a tent, and the Gang of Three stop abruptly at the end of the food line. Chien Po knocks everyone over, like dominoes, and finally the pot overturns. Everyone gets up and advances on Mulan.]\\nMulan:\\nHey, guys ...\\nInside the Captain\\'s Tent\\nGeneral:\\nThe Huns have struck here, here, and here. I will take the main troops up to the Tung Chow Pass and stop Shan Yu before he destroys this village.\\nChi Fu:\\nExcellent strategy, sir! I do love surprises.\\nGeneral:\\n[to Lee Shang] You will stay and train the new recruits. When Chi Fu believes you\\'re ready, you will join us ... Captain.\\nShang:\\nCaptain?\\nChi Fu:\\nOh! This is an enormous responsibility, General! Perhaps a soldier with more experience?\\nGeneral:\\nNumber one in his class, extensive knowledge of training techniques ... an impressive military linuage ... I believe Lee Shang will do an excellent job.\\nShang:\\nOh I will! I won\\'t let you down! This is... I mean... Yes sir.\\nGeneral:\\nVery good, then. We\\'ll toast China\\'s victory at the Imperial City. I\\'ll expect a full report in three weeks.\\nChi Fu:\\nAnd believe me, I won\\'t leave anything out.\\nShang:\\nCaptain Lee Shang. Leader of China\\'s finest troops. No, the greatest troops of all time. [They step outside]\\nChi Fu:\\nMost impressive.\\nGeneral:\\nGood luck, Captain! Yah! [He rides off, followed by two lines of soldiers on horses.]\\nShang:\\nGood luck ... Father.\\nChi Fu:\\nDay one.\\nShang:\\nSoldiers!\\nSoldiers separate, revealing a cowering Mulan\\nSoldiers:\\nHE started it!\\nShang:\\n[to Mulan] I don\\'t need anyone causing trouble in my camp.\\nMulan:\\nSorry ... [in a deep voice] I mean, sorry you had to say that. But you know what it is when you get those manly urges ... just gotta KILL something. Fix things ... a cook outdoors ...\\nShang:\\nWhat\\'s your name?\\nMulan:\\nuh...um...uh...\\nChi Fu:\\nYour commanding officer just asked you a question!\\nMulan:\\nI\\'ve got a name ... and it\\'s a boy\\'s name, too.\\nMushu:\\nLing! How \\'bout Ling?\\nMulan:\\n(to Mushu) HIS name is Ling.\\nShang:\\nI didn\\'t ask for HIS name, I asked for yours!\\nMushu:\\nUh ... Ah-chu!\\nMulan:\\nAh-chu!\\nShang:\\nAH-CHU?!\\nMushu:\\nGesuintit! Hee hee ... I kill myself.\\nMulan:\\nMushu ...\\nShang:\\nMUSHU?\\nMulan:\\nNo.\\nShang:\\nThen WHAT is it?!\\nMushu:\\nPing! Ping was my best friend growing up.\\nMulan:\\nIt\\'s Ping.\\nShang:\\nPing.\\nMushu:\\n\\'Course, Ping did steal my girl--\\nMulan:\\nYes. My name is Ping.\\nShang:\\nLet me see your conscription notice. [Mulan hands the scroll to him.] Fa Zhou? THE Fa Zhou?\\nChi Fu:\\nI didn\\'t know Fa Zhou had a son.\\nMulan:\\nEr, he ... doesn\\'t talk about me much. [She attempts to spit, but fails miserably.]\\nChi Fu:\\nI can see why. The boy\\'s an absolute lunatic! (Laughter)\\nShang:\\nOkay, gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping, you\\'ll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice. Tomorrow, the real work begins.\\nGrumbling\\nMushu:\\nYou know, we have to work on your people skills.\\nInside Mulan\\'s tent\\nMushu picks up Crickee and uses him for an alarm clock.\\nMushu:\\nAll right, rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty! C\\'mon, hup, hup, hup!\\nMulan pulls the blanket over her, and Mushu pulls it off.\\nMushu:\\nGet your clothes on, get ready! Got breakfast ready. Look, you get porridge! And it\\'s happy to see you!\\nCrickee is resting happily in the bowl of porridge, Mushu uses chopsticks to fish him out.\\nMushu:\\nHey, get out of there! You\\'re gonna make people sick!\\nMulan:\\nAm I late?\\nMushu:\\n[stuffs porridge in her mouth] No time to talk. Now, remember, it\\'s your first day of training, so listen to your teacher and no fighting, play nice with the other kids, unless, of course, the other kids want to fight, then you gotta kick the other kid\\'s butt.\\nMulan:\\nBut I don\\'t want to kick the other kids\\' butts.\\nMushu:\\nDon\\'t talk with your mouth full. Now let\\'s see your war face.\\nMulan looks at Mushu, her mouth full of porridge.\\nMushu:\\nOh, I think my bunny slippers just ran for cover. C\\'mon, scare me, girl!\\nMulan:\\nRrrrraaaaarrrgggghhhhh!\\nMushu:\\nThat\\'s my tough looking warrior! That\\'s what I\\'m talking about! Now, get out there and make me proud!\\nKhan neighs frantically\\nMushu:\\nWhat do you mean, the troops just left?\\nMulan:\\nThey WHAT? [She rushes out of the tent]\\nMushu:\\nWait, you forgot your sword! [sniffs] My little baby, off to destroy people ...\\nChi Fu:\\nOrder! People, order!\\nSoldier:\\nI\\'d like a pan-fried noodle!\\nChien Po:\\nSweet and pungent shrimp.\\nChi Fu:\\nThat\\'s not funny.\\nLing:\\nLooks like our new friend slept in this morning. Why, hello, Ping, Are ya hungry?\\nYao:\\nYeah, cause I owe you a knuckle sandwich.\\nShang:\\nSoldiers! You will assemble swiftly and silently, every morning. Anyone who does otherwise, will answer to me.\\nHe takes off his shirt, and Mulan stares in awe.\\nYao:\\nOoh, tough guy.\\nShang:\\n[pulls out a bow and arrow and aims it at Yow, then at the top of a high pole in the middle of the camp.] Yow. Thank you for volunteering. Retrieve the arrow.\\nYao:\\nI\\'ll get that arrow, pretty boy, and I\\'ll do it with my shirt on. [He walks over to the pole and prepares to climb up it.]\\nShang:\\nOne moment, you seem to be missing something. [He pulls two giant medals out of a box.] This represents disipline. And this represents strength. You need both to reach the arrow. [He ties them around Yao\\'s wrists, and all the soldiers after him, and none of them can make it to the arrow.]\\nShang:\\nWe\\'ve got a long way to go.\\nBeginning of \"I\\'ll Make a Man Out of You.\"\\nShang:\\nLet\\'s get down to business\\nTo defeat the Huns\\nDid they send me daughters\\nWhen I asked for sons\\nYou\\'re the saddest bunch\\nI ever met, but you can bet\\nBefore we\\'re through\\nMister, I\\'ll make a man\\nOut of you.\\nTranquil as a forest\\nBut on fire within\\nOnce you find your center\\nYou are sure to win\\nYou\\'re a spineless, pale, pathetic lot\\nAnd you can bet before we\\'re through\\nMister, I\\'ll make a man out of you.\\n\\nChien Po:\\nI\\'m never gonna catch my breath\\nYao:\\nSay good-bye to those who knew me\\nLing:\\nBoy I was a fool in school for cutting gym\\nMushu:\\nThis guy\\'s got \\'em scared to death\\nMulan:\\nI hope he doesn\\'t see right through me\\nChien Po:\\nNow I really wish that I knew how to swim\\n(Be a man)\\nWe must be swift as a coursing river\\n(Be a man)\\nWith all the force of a great typhoon\\n(Be a man)\\nWith all the strength of a raging fire\\nMysterious as the dark side of the moon\\nTime is racing t\\'ward us\\nTill the Huns arrive\\nHeed my every order\\nAnd you might survive\\nYou\\'re unsuited for the rage of war\\nSo pack up, go home, you\\'re through\\nHow could I make a man out of you\\n(Be a man)\\nWe must be swift as a coursing river\\n(Be a man)\\nWith all the force of a great typhoon\\n(Be a man)\\nWith all the strength of a raging fire\\nMysterious as the dark side of the moon\\n(Be a man)\\nWe must be swift as a coursing river\\n(Be a man)\\nWith all the force of a great typhoon\\n(Be a man)\\nWith all the strength of a raging fire\\nMysterious as the dark side of the moon!\\nShan Yu cuts the top off a tree. The hawk flies overhead and drops a small doll. Shan Yu jumps down from the tree and throws the doll to one of the Huns.\\nShan Yu:\\nWhat do you see?\\nHun #1:\\nBlack pine ... from the high mountains!\\nHun #2:\\nWhite horse hair ... Umperial stallions.\\nHun #3:\\nSulphur ... from cannons.\\nShan Yu:\\nThis doll came from a village in the Tung Show Pass, where the Imperial Army is waiting.\\nHun Archer:\\nWe can avoid them easily.\\nShan Yu:\\nNo. The quickest way to the emperor is through that pass. Besides, the little girl will be missing her doll. We should return it to her.\\nMoo Shung Camp, at night\\nMushu:\\nHey, this is not a good idea. What if somebody sees you?\\nMulan:\\nJust because I look like a man doesn\\'t mean I have to smell like one.\\nMushu:\\nso a couple guys don\\'t rinse out their socks. Picky, picky, picky. Myself, I kinda like that corn-chip smell.\\nMulan:\\n[Jumps in the water] Ah.\\nMushu:\\nOkay, all right, alright, that\\'s enough, now c\\'mon, get out before you get all pruney and stuff.\\nMulan:\\nMushu, if you\\'re so worried, go stand watch!\\nMushu:\\nYeah, yeah.

You owe me big!\\nMulan:\\nI never want to see a naked man again.\\nA herd of naked men flash by.\\nMushu:\\nDon\\'t look at me, I ain\\'t biting no more butts.\\nIn Chi Fu\\'s tent\\nChi Fu:\\nYou think your troops are ready to fight? Hah! They wouldn\\'t last a minute against the Huns!\\nShang:\\nThey completed their training.\\nChi Fu:\\nThose boys are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be captain.

A girl worth fighting for!\\nI want her paler than the moon, with eyes that shine like stars.\\nMy girl will marvel at my strength, adore my battle scars!\\nI couldn\\'t care less what she\\'ll wear, or what she looks like!\\nIt all depends on what she cooks like!\\nBeef, pork, chicken, mmm ...\\nBet the local girls thought you were quite the charmer!\\nAnd I bet the ladies love a man in armor!\\nYou can guess what we have missed the most\\nSince we went off to war!\\nWhat do we want?\\nA girl worth fighting for!\\nMy girl will think I have no flaws\\nThat I\\'m a major find\\nHow \\'bout a girl who\\'s got a brain, who always speaks her mind?\\nNah!\\nMy manly ways and turn of phrase and sure to thrill her!\\nHe thinks he\\'s such a lady-killer!\\nI\\'ve a girl back home who\\'s unlike any other!\\nYeah, the only girl who\\'d love him is his mother!\\nBut when we come home, in victory\\nThey\\'ll line up at the door!\\nWhat do we want?\\nA girl worth fighting for!\\nWish that I had\\nA girl worth fighting for!\\nA girl worth fighting--\\nThe Chinese army stares in horror at the charred and burning remnants of a small village. They walk through it.\\nShang:\\nSearch for survivors!\\nMulan picks up a small doll\\nShang:\\nI don\\'t understand. My father should\\'ve been here.\\nChi Fu:\\nCaptain! (They turn to see a bloody battlefield full of dead Chinese soldiers. Chien-Po hands the general\\'s helmet to Shang.)\\nChien-Po:\\nThe ... general.\\nShang takes his sword and sticks it in the snow, then places the helmet on the hilt and says a prayer.\\nMulan:\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nShang:\\n[mounts his horse] The Huns are moving quickly. We\\'ll make better time to the Imperial City through the Tung Show pass. We\\'re the only hope for the Emperor now. Move out!\\nThe army slowly walks away. Mulan places the doll by Shang\\'s sword and joins the others.\\nAs the Chinese Soldiers slowly walk through the mountain pass, a rocket in the wagon attached to Khan suddenly goes off, shooting into the sky. Mulan looks at Mushu accusingly.\\nShang:\\nWhat happened? You just gave away out position! Now we\\'re-- [an arrow hits his shoulder, throwing him off the horse. Huns appear on a cliff, and arrows shower down on the soldiers.] Get out of range!\\nThe pitiful Chinese army struggles to get away from the Huns, but are intercepted by another group of Huns up on another cliff.\\nShang:\\nSave the cannons! [The soldiers pass the cannons from the wagon to each other. The wagon gets hit by a flaming arrow, and Mulan cuts Khan\\'s reins and mounts him. The wagon explodes, sending Mushu and Crickee flying. Mulan falls off the horse.]\\nMushu:\\nOh, sure, save the horse. [Mulan grabs Mushu and her sword and runs over to the other soldiers.]\\nShang:\\nFire! [The soldier lights the cannon, and it explodes on the mountain. More follow.] Fire! [There is no sound from the Huns, who are no longer on the cliffs.] Hold the last cannon.\\nSuddenly, a horse appears on the hill. Shan Yu is soon joined by hundreds of Hun soldiers.\\nShang:\\nPrepare to fight. If we die, we die with honor. [The Huns charge the Chinese Army.] Yao. Aim the cannon at Shan Yu. [Yao aims the cannon.]\\nWhile glancing at her sword, Mulan notices a glacial overhang. She grabs the cannon and runs toward the Huns, aiming at the overhang.\\nShang:\\nPing! Ping, come back!\\nFrantically, as Shan Yu draws nearer, his sword raised, Mulan fumbles with the match.\\nMushu:\\nOkay, you might want to light that right about now, Quickly, quickly! [Mulan is attacked by Shan Yu\\'s hawk, and loses the match.]\\nYao:\\nC\\'mon, we gotta help! [The Gang of Three run toward Mulan, swinging their swords.]\\nMulan uses Mushu to light the cannon fuse, and it shoots off toward the overhang.\\nMushu:\\nYou missed! How could you miss?! He was three feet in front of you! [The cannon hits the overhang with a bang, and causes an avalanche that rains down on the Hun Army, burying in them. In fury, Shan Yu roars and hits Mulan in the side with his sword blade. She quickly runs away from the avalanche, pulling Shang with her. Khan runs toward them, and Mulan gets on and tries to give Shang a hand, but he loses his grip and is dragged into the snow.]\\nMushu:\\n[riding down the snow in a hubcap] Mulan!! Mulan! Mulan? [He pulls a Hun\\'s head out of the snow.] Nope. Mulan! [He reaches down and pulls out Crickee.] Man, you are one lucky bug.\\nMulan and Khan break out of the snow and race toward Shang, who, unconscious, is sliding on the snow toward a cliff.\\nMulan:\\nShang! [She pulls him up onto the saddle.]\\nChien-Po:\\n[holding up Yao] Do you see them?\\nYao:\\nYes! [He fits an arrow, which is tied to a length of rope, and shoots it toward Mulan.] Perfect! Now I\\'ll pull them to safety! [The rope slips through his hands.]\\nMushu:\\n[sliding near Mulan and Shang] Mulan! I found a lucky cricket!\\nMulan:\\nWe need help! [The arrow flies near them, Mulan grabs it and ties it around Khan.]\\nMushu:\\n[to Crickee] Nice, very nice! You can sit by me! [They climb up onto Khan, and notice the cliff.] Aaaugh!!! We\\'re gonna die! We\\'re gonna die! No way we survive this! Death is coming! [Mulan shoots the arrow up as they fall off the cliff.]\\nYao:\\n[crying] I let them slip through my fingers ... [looks surprised as the arrow, complete with rope, lands in his hands. He is dragged toward the cliff edge, soldiers jumping on top of him. Finally Chien-Po walks over, picks all the soldiers up, and walks backward, pulling Mulan, Khan, and Shang up onto the ground.]\\nMushu:\\nI knew we could do it! You the man! Well, sort of.\\nLing:\\nStep back, guys. Give him some air!\\nShang:\\n[breathing heavily] Ping, you are the craziest man I ever met. And for that, I owe you my life. From now on, you have my trust.\\nLing:\\nLet\\'s hear it for Ping, the bravest of us all!\\nYao:\\nYou\\'re King of the Mountain!\\nCheering\\nMulan tries to stand up, but collapses to the ground, gasping.\\nShang:\\nPing! What\\'s wrong? [Mulan moves her hands to reveal blood.] He\\'s wounded! Get help! [Mulan sinks into unconsciousness.] Ping, hold on. Hold on.\\nThe doctor emerges from his tent and says something to Shang, who looks disturbed and rushes inside. He looks at Mulan, who sits up in bed, her side bandaged. Shang stares at her, recognizing her as a girl. Mulan realizes her mistake and pulls the blanket back on.\\nMulan:\\nI can explain!\\nChi Fu:\\nSo it\\'s true!\\nMulan:\\nShang!\\nChi Fu:\\n[yanking Mulan out of the tent and pulling her hair out of a bun] I knew there was something wrong with you! A woman! Treacherous snake!\\nMulan:\\nMy name is Mulan. I did it to save my father!\\nChi Fu:\\nHigh treason!\\nMulan:\\nI didn\\'t mean for it to go this far!\\nChi Fu:\\nUltimate dishonor!\\nMulan:\\nIt was the only way! Please, believe me!\\nChi Fu:\\nCaptain?\\nShang walks over to Khan and takes out Mulan\\'s sword. The Gang of Three start to rush over to her, but Chi Fu stops them.\\nChi Fu:\\n[to the soldiers holding Khan] Restrain him. [to the Gang of Three] You know the law.\\nShang walks over to Mulan and throws the sword in the snow in front of her.\\nShang:\\nA life for a life. My debt is repaid. [to the soldiers] Move out!\\nChi Fu:\\nBut you can\\'t just ...\\nShang:\\n[to Chi Fu] I said, \\'Move out.\\'\\nThe Chinese Army sadly walks away, leaving Mulan, Mushu, and Khan in the snow.\\nMushu:\\nI was this close. This close! To impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, in entourage ... man. All my fine work. [He uses the tip of an arrow to roast a piece of food over a tiny fire.]\\nMulan:\\nI should never have left home.\\nMushu:\\nHey C\\'mon. You wanted to save your father\\'s life. Who knew you\\'d end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors and losing all your friends. Y\\'know, you just gotta ... just gotta learn to let these things go.\\nMulan:\\nMaybe I didn\\'t go for my father. Maybe what I really wanted was to prove that I could do things right. So that when I looked in the mirror (she picks up her helmet) I\\'d see someone worthwhile. But I was wrong. I see nothing.\\nMushu:\\nHey, that\\'s just cause this needs a little spit, that\\'s all. [He spits on the helmet.] Let me shine this up for you. I can see you, lookit you, you look so pretty! The truth is, we\\'re both frauds. Your ancestors didn\\'t send me; they don\\'t even like me. I mean, you risked your life to help people you love. I risked your life to help myself. At least you had good intentions.\\nCrickee starts to cry\\nMushu:\\nWhat do you mean, you\\'re not lucky! You ... lied to me? [Crickee nods. Mushu turns to Khan.] And what are you, a sheep?\\nMulan:\\nI\\'ll have to face my father sooner or later. Let\\'s go home\\nMushu:\\nYeah. This ain\\'t gonna be pretty. But don\\'t u worry, okay? Things will work out. We started this thing together and that\\'s how we\\'ll finish it. I promise.\\nThe shadow of a hawk flies overheard, and around a bend. Shan Yu climb out of the snow and looks around. He lets out a roar. Soon he is joined by five of his soldiers. They start down the path toward the Imperial City. Mulan watches them, grabs her sword, mounts Khan and turns after the Huns.\\nMushu:\\nUh, home is that way.\\nMulan:\\nI have to do something.\\nMushu:\\nDid you see those Huns? They popped out of the snow! LIKE DAISIES!\\nMulan:\\nAre we in this together, or not?\\nMushu:\\n[looks guilty] Let\\'s go kick some Honey Bunch! [He and Crickee jump on Khan, and they ride down the mountain, whooping.]\\nIn the Imperial City\\nThe Chinese citizens watch happily as the Imperial City celebrates the Chinese victory with a parade.\\nParade Leader:\\nMake way for the heroes of China! [Shang, the Gang of Three and the other soldiers follow glumly behind, and behind them is a large Chinese dragon.]\\nMulan comes riding up beside Shang\\nMulan:\\nShang!\\nShang:\\nMulan?\\nMulan:\\nThe Huns are alive! They\\'re in the city!\\nShang:\\nYou don\\'t belong here, Mulan. Go home.\\nMulan:\\nShang, I saw them in the mountains! You have to believe me!\\nShang:\\nWhy should I?\\nMulan:\\nWhy else would I come back? You said you\\'d trust Ping. Why is Mulan any different? [Shang rides around her.] [To the Gang of Three] Keep your eyes open. I know they\\'re here. Yah!\\nMushu:\\n[as Mulan dismounts Khan] Now where are you going?\\nMulan:\\nTo find someone who will believe me! [she hurries off into the crowd.]\\nThe Chinese Army climbs the steps to the Great Palace, followed by the Chinese Dragon. The Emperor meets them.\\nEmperor:\\nMy children! Heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom! Chin will sleep safely tonight, thanks to our brave warriors!\\nMulan:\\n[to a citizen] Sir, the Emperor\\'s in danger!\\nMan:\\nHuh!\\nMulan:\\nBut the Huns are HERE! [to another man] Please, you have to help!\\nMan:\\nEh!\\nMulan:\\n[to Mushu] No one will listen!\\nMushu:\\nHuh? Oh, I\\'m sorry, did you say something?\\nMulan:\\nMushu ...\\nMushu:\\nHey, you\\'re a girl again, remember?\\nShang:\\nYour Majesty, I present to you the sword of Shan Yu.\\nEmperor:\\nI know what this means to you, Captain Li. Your father would have been very proud.\\nShan Yu\\'s hawk swoops down and grabs the sword. It flaps up to the roof, where a line of stone gargoyles are resting. One of the gargoyles moves and takes the sword. Huns jump out of the Chinese Dragon. One of them grabs the Emperor and takes him into the palace.\\nShang:\\nNo!\\nYao:\\nC\\'mon! [They run up to the palace, but the Huns close the great doors. On the roof, Shan Yu laughs.]\\nThe Chinese Army uses a statue to try to break into the palace.\\nMulan:\\nThey\\'ll never reach the Emperor in time. [She looks around, then at the tall pillars by the side of the palace. She whistles to them.] Hey guys! I\\'ve got an idea! [The Gang of Three looks at each other and then follows Mulan, dropping the statue.]\\nThey all take off their equipment, and put on dresses and makeup, and they use the silk belts around their waists to climb up the pillars. Next to them, Shang takes off his cape and climbs up.\\nInside the palace, on a balcony, the Huns hold the Emperor. Shan Yu sticks his head in their faces.\\nShan Yu:\\n[to the Emperor] Boo. [to his soldiers] Guard the door! [to the Emperor] Your walls and armies have fallen. And now it\\'s your turn. Bow to me.\\nOutside, Mulan and the Gang of Three prepare to get past the guards.\\nMulan:\\nOkay. Any questions?\\nYao:\\nDoes this dress make me look fat? [he is slapped] Ow!\\nThe four \"girls\" walk near the guards, giggling.\\nGuard:\\nWho\\'s there?\\nGuard #2:\\nConcubines.\\nGuard:\\nUgly concubines.\\nAn apple rolls out of Ling\\'s dress. One of the guards picks it up. The hawk notices Shang hiding, and tries to call out, but Mushu breaths fire and torches him.\\nMushu:\\nNow that\\'s what I call Mongolian barbeque.\\nThe guard hands the apple to Ling, but the Gang of Three all pull fruit out of their dresses and attack the guards.\\nMulan:\\nShang! Go! [Shang runs up the stairs and into the room where Shan Yu and the Emperor are.]\\nShan Yu:\\nI tire of your arrogance, old man. Bow to me!\\nEmperor:\\nNo matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it.\\nShan Yu:\\n[raising his sword] Then you will kneel ... in pieces! [He swings the sword; Shang rushes in and blocks it. He is swung around a pillar, and then kicks Shan Yu in the face.]\\nMulan:\\nChien-Po, get the Emperor!\\nChien-Po:\\nSorry, your Majesty. [He picks up the Emperor, and, using his silk belt, slides down the cord paper lanterns are strung on.]\\nShun Yu:\\nNo! [He picks up Shang and smashes his head against Shang\\'s. Mulan winces, then looks down at the ground, where Yao and Ling are waiting.]\\nYao:\\nCome on!\\nMulan looks back at the unconscious Shang, and at Shan Yu who is approaching him. She pulls Shan Yu\\'s sword out of the pillar and cuts the cord. People below cheer.\\nShan Yu:\\nNo! [He turns to Shang, who is now conscious.] You! You took away my victory! [He is hit by a shoe.]\\nMulan:\\nNo! I did. [She pulls back her hair.]\\nShan Yu:\\nThe soldier from the mountain! [Abandoning Shang, he chases after Mulan, who is putting on her shoe. She slams the door shut, and he rams his fist through the wood. Mulan is joined by Mushu and Crickee, riding the feather-less hawk.]\\nMushu:\\nSo what\\'s the plan?\\nMulan:\\nUmmmmm ...\\nMushu:\\nYOU DON\\'T HAVE A PLAN?\\nMulan:\\nHey, I\\'m making this up as I ... go ... [as they pass a window she notices a pile of fireworks and two men.] Mushu--\\nMushu:\\nWay ahead of you, sister! C\\'mon, Crickee! [They jump onto a paper kite decoration and float across to the tower. Shan Yu attacks Mulan, and she shinnies up a pole. Shan Yu cuts down the pole, and Mulan and the pole go through the wall. Mulan jumps up and grabs onto the roof and pulls herself up. She looks across to where Mushu and Crickee are gathering ammunition.]\\nMushu:\\nCitizens. I need firepower!\\nCitizen:\\nWho are you?\\nMushu:\\n[looking fierce] Your worst nightmare. [The two men jump off the tower.]\\nMan:\\nLook! On the roof!\\nMulan backs along the roof, mesuring the distance with her hands. Shan Yu crashes through the roof and raises his sword. Mulan pulls out a paper fan.\\nShan Yu:\\nGuess you\\'re out of ideas. [He stabs the sword through the fan; Mulan turns it around and readies the sword.]\\nMulan:\\nNot quite. Ready, Mushu?\\nMushu:\\n[with a rocket strapped to his back] I am ready, baby! [He breaths fire on a stick and hands it to Crickee.] Light me!\\nMulan kicks Shan Yu in the face, then trips him and pins his shirt to the ground with the sword. Crickee lights the fuse, and the rocket slams Shan Yu straight into the firework tower.\\nMulan:\\n[picking up Mushu] Get off the roof, get off the roof! [As the fireworks explode, she jumps, catches a lantern and swings down the cord, then drops onto Shang, who is running down the stairs. Shan Yu\\'s sword and Mushu land nearby.]\\nMushu:\\nAhahahahahaha! [He catches Crickee] You are a lucky bug!\\nChi Fu:\\nThat was a deliberate attempt on my life! Where is she? Now she\\'s done it! What a mess! Stand aside, that creature\\'s not worth protecting.\\nShang:\\nShe\\'s a hero!\\nChi Fu:\\nShe\\'s a woman. She\\'ll never be worth anything!\\nShang:\\nListen, you pompous ...\\nEmperor:\\nThat is enough!\\nShang:\\nYour Majesty, I can explain! [The Emperor raises a hand and the Gang of Three move to the side, revealing Mulan.]\\nEmperor:\\nI\\'ve heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan. You stole your father\\'s armor, ran away from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese Army, destroyed my palace! And you have saved us all. [He bows to her, and row by row, every person in the Imperial City bows to her.]\\nMushu:\\nOur little baby is all grown up and saving China! [To Crickee] Do you have a tissue?\\nEmperor:\\nChi Fu!\\nChi Fu:\\nYour Excellency?\\nEmperor:\\nSee that this woman is made a member of my council.\\nChi Fu:\\nWhat? There are no council positions open, your Majesty!\\nEmperor:\\nVery well. You can have his job.\\nChi Fu:\\nWha? ... My? ... [He faints.]\\nMulan:\\nWith all due respect, your Excellency, I think I\\'ve been away from home long enough.\\nEmperor:\\nThen take this [he hands her a pendant], so your family will know what you have done for me. And this [he hands her the sword of Shan Yu] so the world will know what you have done for China.\\nMulan takes the gifts, then hugs the Emperor\\nYao:\\nIs she allowed to do that? [Ling, Chien-Po and Shang shrug.]\\nMulan steps away and hugs the Gang of Three, then walks over to Shang.\\nShang:\\nUm ... you ... You fight good.\\nMulan:\\n[disappointed] Oh. Thank you. [She mounts Khan.]\\nMulan:\\nKhan, let\\'s go home. [As she rides away, everyone cheers.]\\nEmperor:\\n[To Shang] The flower that blooms in adversity is the rarest and most beautiful of all.\\nShang:\\n... Sir? ...\\nEmperor:\\nYou don\\'t meet a girl like that every dynasty! [He puts on his hat and walks away.]\\nAt Mulan\\'s house\\nMulan approaches her father, who is sitting under the cherry trees. She kneels in front of him.\\nFa Zhou:\\nMulan!\\nMulan:\\nFather! I\\'ve brought you the sword of Shan-Yu. And the Crest of the Emperor! They\\'re gifts to honor the Fa Family. [Her father drops the gifts and hugs her.]\\nFa Zhou:\\nThe greatest gift in honor is having you for a daughter. I\\'ve missed you so.\\nMulan:\\nI\\'ve missed you too, Baba.\\nGranny Fa:\\n[watching them] Huh. She brings home a sword. If you ask me she should\\'ve brought home a man!\\nShang:\\nExcuse me, does Fa Mulan live here?\\nGranny Fa and Fa Li point, dumbstruck.\\nShang:\\nThank you.\\nGranny Fa:\\nWoo! Sign me up for the next four!\\nShang:\\nHonorable Fa Zhou, I-- Mulan! Uhhhh ... you forgot your helmet. Well, actually it\\'s your helmet, isn\\'t it, I mean ...\\nMulan:\\nWould you like to stay for dinner?\\nGranny Fa:\\nWould you like to stay forever?\\nShang:\\nDinner would be great.\\nMushu:\\n[to Great Ancestor] Who did a good job? C\\'mon, tell me who did a good job.\\nGreat Ancestor:\\nOh, all right. You can be a guardian again.\\nMushu:\\nAAAAAHHH-HAAAAAAAA!!! Whoohoohoohoohoooo!\\nCrickee rings the gong; all the ancestors come out.\\nMushu:\\nTake it, Crickee! [Crickee plays a set of drums, and all the ancestors dance.]\\nAncestor #2:\\nYou know, she gets it from my side of the family! (Mushu swings on a chain, yelling.

WHEN WENDY GREW UP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter I.\\nPETER BREAKS THROUGH\\n\\n\\nAll children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow\\nup, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old\\nshe was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran\\nwith it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather\\ndelightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh,\\nwhy can’t you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed\\nbetween them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must\\ngrow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the\\nend.\\n\\nOf course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the\\nchief one. She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet\\nmocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within\\nthe other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover\\nthere is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on\\nit that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly\\nconspicuous in the right-hand corner.\\n\\nThe way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been\\nboys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,\\nand they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who\\ntook a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her,\\nexcept the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and\\nin time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could\\nhave got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a\\npassion, slamming the door.\\n\\nMr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him\\nbut respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks\\nand shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know,\\nand he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that\\nwould have made any woman respect him.\\n\\nMrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books\\nperfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a\\nBrussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped\\nout, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.\\nShe drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs.\\nDarling’s guesses.\\n\\nWendy came first, then John, then Michael.\\n\\nFor a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would\\nbe able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was\\nfrightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the\\nedge of Mrs. Darling’s bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses,\\nwhile she looked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what\\nmight, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece\\nof paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at\\nthe beginning again.\\n\\n“Now don’t interrupt,” he would beg of her.\\n\\n“I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can\\ncut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and\\nsix, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five\\nnaught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven—who is that\\nmoving?—eight nine seven, dot and carry seven—don’t speak, my own—and\\nthe pound you lent to that man who came to the door—quiet, child—dot\\nand carry child—there, you’ve done it!—did I say nine nine seven? yes,\\nI said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on\\nnine nine seven?”\\n\\n“Of course we can, George,” she cried. But she was prejudiced in\\nWendy’s favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.\\n\\n“Remember mumps,” he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went\\nagain. “Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay it\\nwill be more like thirty shillings—don’t speak—measles one five, German\\nmeasles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six—don’t waggle your\\nfinger—whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings”—and so on it went, and it\\nadded up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through,\\nwith mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated\\nas one.\\n\\nThere was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a\\nnarrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the\\nthree of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom’s Kindergarten school,\\naccompanied by their nurse.\\n\\nMrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a\\npassion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had\\na nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children\\ndrank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had\\nbelonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She\\nhad always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had\\nbecome acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most\\nof her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by\\ncareless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of\\nto their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How\\nthorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one\\nof her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the\\nnursery. She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have\\nno patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She\\nbelieved to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf,\\nand made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs,\\nand so on. It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the\\nchildren to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well\\nbehaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. On John’s\\nfooter days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried\\nan umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the\\nbasement of Miss Fulsom’s school where the nurses wait. They sat on\\nforms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference.\\nThey affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to\\nthemselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to\\nthe nursery from Mrs. Darling’s friends, but if they did come she first\\nwhipped off Michael’s pinafore and put him into the one with blue\\nbraiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John’s hair.\\n\\nNo nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr.\\nDarling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the\\nneighbours talked.\\n\\nHe had his position in the city to consider.\\n\\nNana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that\\nshe did not admire him. “I know she admires you tremendously, George,”\\nMrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children\\nto be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the\\nonly other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget\\nshe looked in her long skirt and maid’s cap, though she had sworn, when\\nengaged, that she would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps!\\nAnd gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that\\nall you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at\\nher you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family\\nuntil the coming of Peter Pan.\\n\\nMrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her\\nchildren’s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after\\nher children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things\\nstraight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many\\narticles that have wandered during the day. If you could keep awake\\n(but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and\\nyou would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like\\ntidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering\\nhumorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had\\npicked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet,\\npressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and\\nhurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the\\nnaughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been\\nfolded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top,\\nbeautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you\\nto put on.\\n\\nI don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind.\\nDoctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can\\nbecome intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a\\nchild’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the\\ntime. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a\\ncard, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is\\nalways more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here\\nand there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and\\nsavages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves\\nthrough which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a\\nhut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked\\nnose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first\\nday at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,\\nhangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting\\ninto braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth\\nyourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they\\nare another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing,\\nespecially as nothing will stand still.\\n\\nOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a\\nlagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while\\nMichael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over\\nit. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a\\nwigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no\\nfriends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by\\nits parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance,\\nand if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have\\neach other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play\\nare for ever beaching their coracles. We too have been there; we can\\nstill hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.\\n\\nOf all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most\\ncompact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances\\nbetween one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at\\nit by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least\\nalarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very\\nreal. That is why there are night-lights.\\n\\nOccasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling\\nfound things she could not understand, and of these quite the most\\nperplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was\\nhere and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be\\nscrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than\\nany of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had\\nan oddly cocky appearance.\\n\\n“Yes, he is rather cocky,” Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother had\\nbeen questioning her.\\n\\n“But who is he, my pet?”\\n\\n“He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.”\\n\\nAt first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her\\nchildhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the\\nfairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died\\nhe went part of the way with them, so that they should not be\\nfrightened. She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was\\nmarried and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such\\nperson.\\n\\n“Besides,” she said to Wendy, “he would be grown up by this time.”\\n\\n“Oh no, he isn’t grown up,” Wendy assured her confidently, “and he is\\njust my size.” She meant that he was her size in both mind and body;\\nshe didn’t know how she knew, she just knew it.\\n\\nMrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. “Mark my\\nwords,” he said, “it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their\\nheads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it\\nwill blow over.”\\n\\nBut it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs.\\nDarling quite a shock.\\n\\nChildren have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.\\nFor instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event\\nhappened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead\\nfather and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy\\none morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had\\nbeen found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when\\nthe children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when\\nWendy said with a tolerant smile:\\n\\n“I do believe it is that Peter again!”\\n\\n“Whatever do you mean, Wendy?”\\n\\n“It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said, sighing.\\nShe was a tidy child.\\n\\nShe explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter\\nsometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her\\nbed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so\\nshe didn’t know how she knew, she just knew.\\n\\n“What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house\\nwithout knocking.”\\n\\n“I think he comes in by the window,” she said.\\n\\n“My love, it is three floors up.”\\n\\n“Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?”\\n\\nIt was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.\\n\\nMrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural\\nto Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.\\n\\n“My child,” the mother cried, “why did you not tell me of this before?”\\n\\n“I forgot,” said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her\\nbreakfast.\\n\\nOh, surely she must have been dreaming.\\n\\nBut, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined\\nthem very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they\\ndid not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the\\nfloor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She\\nrattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. She let down a\\ntape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty\\nfeet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.\\n\\nCertainly Wendy had been dreaming.\\n\\nBut Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the\\nnight on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be\\nsaid to have begun.\\n\\nOn the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It\\nhappened to be Nana’s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and\\nsung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away\\ninto the land of sleep.\\n\\nAll were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and\\nsat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.\\n\\nIt was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into\\nshirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three\\nnight-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling’s lap. Then\\nher head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of\\nthem, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the\\nfire. There should have been a fourth night-light.\\n\\nWhile she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come\\ntoo near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not\\nalarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many\\nwomen who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of\\nsome mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures\\nthe Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through\\nthe gap.\\n\\nThe dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was\\ndreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the\\nfloor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist,\\nwhich darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must\\nhave been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.\\n\\nShe started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at\\nonce that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we\\nshould have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling’s kiss. He was a\\nlovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of\\ntrees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his\\nfirst teeth. When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little\\npearls at her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter II.\\nTHE SHADOW\\n\\n\\nMrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened,\\nand Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang\\nat the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling\\nscreamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed,\\nand she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it\\nwas not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see\\nnothing but what she thought was a shooting star.\\n\\nShe returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her\\nmouth, which proved to be the boy’s shadow. As he leapt at the window\\nNana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had\\nnot had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.\\n\\nYou may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was\\nquite the ordinary kind.\\n\\nNana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow.\\nShe hung it out at the window, meaning “He is sure to come back for it;\\nlet us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the\\nchildren.”\\n\\nBut unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the\\nwindow, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the\\nhouse. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up\\nwinter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his\\nhead to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him;\\nbesides, she knew exactly what he would say: “It all comes of having a\\ndog for a nurse.”\\n\\nShe decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a\\ndrawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah\\nme!\\n\\nThe opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten\\nFriday. Of course it was a Friday.\\n\\n“I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,” she used to say\\nafterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of\\nher, holding her hand.\\n\\n“No, no,” Mr. Darling always said, “I am responsible for it all. I,\\nGeorge Darling, did it. _Mea culpa, mea culpa_.” He had had a classical\\neducation.\\n\\nThey sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every\\ndetail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other\\nside like the faces on a bad coinage.\\n\\n“If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,” Mrs.\\nDarling said.\\n\\n“If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana’s bowl,” said Mr.\\nDarling.\\n\\n“If only I had pretended to like the medicine,” was what Nana’s wet\\neyes said.\\n\\n“My liking for parties, George.”\\n\\n“My fatal gift of humour, dearest.”\\n\\n“My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.”\\n\\nThen one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the\\nthought, “It’s true, it’s true, they ought not to have had a dog for a\\nnurse.” Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to\\nNana’s eyes.\\n\\n“That fiend!” Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana’s bark was the echo of\\nit, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the\\nright-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.\\n\\nThey would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every\\nsmallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully,\\nso precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the\\nwater for Michael’s bath and carrying him to it on her back.\\n\\n“I won’t go to bed,” he had shouted, like one who still believed that\\nhe had the last word on the subject, “I won’t, I won’t. Nana, it isn’t\\nsix o’clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan’t love you any more, Nana. I\\ntell you I won’t be bathed, I won’t, I won’t!”\\n\\nThen Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had\\ndressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown,\\nwith the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy’s\\nbracelet on her arm; she had asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to\\nlend her bracelet to her mother.\\n\\nShe had found her two older children playing at being herself and\\nfather on the occasion of Wendy’s birth, and John was saying:\\n\\n“I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,” in\\njust such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real\\noccasion.\\n\\nWendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have\\ndone.\\n\\nThen John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the\\nbirth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also,\\nbut John said brutally that they did not want any more.\\n\\nMichael had nearly cried. “Nobody wants me,” he said, and of course the\\nlady in the evening-dress could not stand that.\\n\\n“I do,” she said, “I so want a third child.”\\n\\n“Boy or girl?” asked Michael, not too hopefully.\\n\\n“Boy.”\\n\\nThen he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs.\\nDarling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be\\nMichael’s last night in the nursery.\\n\\nThey go on with their recollections.\\n\\n“It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn’t it?” Mr. Darling\\nwould say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.\\n\\nPerhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for\\nthe party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It\\nis an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew\\nabout stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the\\nthing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when\\nit would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride\\nand used a made-up tie.\\n\\nThis was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the\\ncrumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.\\n\\n“Why, what is the matter, father dear?”\\n\\n“Matter!” he yelled; he really yelled. “This tie, it will not tie.” He\\nbecame dangerously sarcastic. “Not round my neck! Round the bed-post!\\nOh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my\\nneck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!”\\n\\nHe thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on\\nsternly, “I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my\\nneck we don’t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don’t go out to\\ndinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don’t go to\\nthe office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into\\nthe streets.”\\n\\nEven then Mrs. Darling was placid. “Let me try, dear,” she said, and\\nindeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice\\ncool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to\\nsee their fate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to\\ndo it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he\\nthanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment\\nwas dancing round the room with Michael on his back.\\n\\n“How wildly we romped!” says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.\\n\\n“Our last romp!” Mr. Darling groaned.\\n\\n“O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, ‘How did you\\nget to know me, mother?’”\\n\\n“I remember!”\\n\\n“They were rather sweet, don’t you think, George?”\\n\\n“And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.”\\n\\nThe romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr.\\nDarling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They\\nwere not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had\\nwith braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears\\ncoming. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again\\nabout its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.\\n\\n“George, Nana is a treasure.”\\n\\n“No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon\\nthe children as puppies.”\\n\\n“Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.”\\n\\n“I wonder,” Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, “I wonder.” It was an\\nopportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first he\\npooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the\\nshadow.\\n\\n“It is nobody I know,” he said, examining it carefully, “but it does\\nlook a scoundrel.”\\n\\n“We were still discussing it, you remember,” says Mr. Darling, “when\\nNana came in with Michael’s medicine. You will never carry the bottle\\nin your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.”\\n\\nStrong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather\\nfoolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking\\nthat all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when\\nMichael dodged the spoon in Nana’s mouth, he had said reprovingly, “Be\\na man, Michael.”\\n\\n“Won’t; won’t!” Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to\\nget a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of\\nfirmness.\\n\\n“Mother, don’t pamper him,” he called after her. “Michael, when I was\\nyour age I took medicine without a murmur. I said, ‘Thank you, kind\\nparents, for giving me bottles to make me well.’”\\n\\nHe really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her\\nnight-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, “That\\nmedicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Ever so much nastier,” Mr. Darling said bravely, “and I would take it\\nnow as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn’t lost the bottle.”\\n\\nHe had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the\\ntop of the wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that\\nthe faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.\\n\\n“I know where it is, father,” Wendy cried, always glad to be of\\nservice. “I’ll bring it,” and she was off before he could stop her.\\nImmediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.\\n\\n“John,” he said, shuddering, “it’s most beastly stuff. It’s that nasty,\\nsticky, sweet kind.”\\n\\n“It will soon be over, father,” John said cheerily, and then in rushed\\nWendy with the medicine in a glass.\\n\\n“I have been as quick as I could,” she panted.\\n\\n“You have been wonderfully quick,” her father retorted, with a\\nvindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. “Michael\\nfirst,” he said doggedly.\\n\\n“Father first,” said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.\\n\\n“I shall be sick, you know,” Mr. Darling said threateningly.\\n\\n“Come on, father,” said John.\\n\\n“Hold your tongue, John,” his father rapped out.\\n\\nWendy was quite puzzled. “I thought you took it quite easily, father.”\\n\\n“That is not the point,” he retorted. “The point is, that there is more\\nin my glass than in Michael’s spoon.” His proud heart was nearly\\nbursting. “And it isn’t fair: I would say it though it were with my\\nlast breath; it isn’t fair.”\\n\\n“Father, I am waiting,” said Michael coldly.\\n\\n“It’s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.”\\n\\n“Father’s a cowardly custard.”\\n\\n“So are you a cowardly custard.”\\n\\n“I’m not frightened.”\\n\\n“Neither am I frightened.”\\n\\n“Well, then, take it.”\\n\\n“Well, then, you take it.”\\n\\nWendy had a splendid idea. “Why not both take it at the same time?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” said Mr. Darling. “Are you ready, Michael?”\\n\\nWendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine,\\nbut Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.\\n\\nThere was a yell of rage from Michael, and “O father!” Wendy exclaimed.\\n\\n“What do you mean by ‘O father’?” Mr. Darling demanded. “Stop that row,\\nMichael. I meant to take mine, but I—I missed it.”\\n\\nIt was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if\\nthey did not admire him. “Look here, all of you,” he said entreatingly,\\nas soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. “I have just thought of a\\nsplendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana’s bowl, and she will\\ndrink it, thinking it is milk!”\\n\\nIt was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father’s\\nsense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the\\nmedicine into Nana’s bowl. “What fun!” he said doubtfully, and they did\\nnot dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.\\n\\n“Nana, good dog,” he said, patting her, “I have put a little milk into\\nyour bowl, Nana.”\\n\\nNana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then\\nshe gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the\\ngreat red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into\\nher kennel.\\n\\nMr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give\\nin. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. “O George,” she\\nsaid, “it’s your medicine!”\\n\\n“It was only a joke,” he roared, while she comforted her boys, and\\nWendy hugged Nana. “Much good,” he said bitterly, “my wearing myself to\\nthe bone trying to be funny in this house.”\\n\\nAnd still Wendy hugged Nana. “That’s right,” he shouted. “Coddle her!\\nNobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why should I\\nbe coddled—why, why, why!”\\n\\n“George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; the servants will\\nhear you.” Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the\\nservants.\\n\\n“Let them!” he answered recklessly. “Bring in the whole world. But I\\nrefuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer.”\\n\\nThe children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her\\nback. He felt he was a strong man again. “In vain, in vain,” he cried;\\n“the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up\\nthis instant.”\\n\\n“George, George,” Mrs. Darling whispered, “remember what I told you\\nabout that boy.”\\n\\nAlas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in\\nthat house, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he\\nlured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly,\\ndragged her from the nursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did\\nit. It was all owing to his too affectionate nature, which craved for\\nadmiration. When he had tied her up in the back-yard, the wretched\\nfather went and sat in the passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.\\n\\nIn the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted\\nsilence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and\\nJohn whimpered, “It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,” but\\nWendy was wiser.\\n\\n“That is not Nana’s unhappy bark,” she said, little guessing what was\\nabout to happen; “that is her bark when she smells danger.”\\n\\nDanger!\\n\\n“Are you sure, Wendy?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes.”\\n\\nMrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened.\\nShe looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were\\ncrowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place\\nthere, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller\\nones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made\\nher cry, “Oh, how I wish that I wasn’t going to a party to-night!”\\n\\nEven Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he\\nasked, “Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?”\\n\\n“Nothing, precious,” she said; “they are the eyes a mother leaves\\nbehind her to guard her children.”\\n\\nShe went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little\\nMichael flung his arms round her. “Mother,” he cried, “I’m glad of\\nyou.” They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long\\ntime.\\n\\nNo. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall\\nof snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly\\nnot to soil their shoes. They were already the only persons in the\\nstreet, and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but\\nthey may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on\\nfor ever. It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long\\nago that no star now knows what it was. So the older ones have become\\nglassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the\\nlittle ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who\\nhad a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow\\nthem out; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side\\nto-night, and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon\\nas the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion\\nin the firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way\\nscreamed out:\\n\\n“Now, Peter!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter III.\\nCOME AWAY, COME AWAY!\\n\\n\\nFor a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights\\nby the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were\\nawfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they\\ncould have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy’s light blinked and gave\\nsuch a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close\\ntheir mouths all the three went out.\\n\\nThere was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than\\nthe night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had\\nbeen in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter’s shadow,\\nrummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not\\nreally a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but\\nwhen it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer\\nthan your hand, but still growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell\\nexquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through\\nwhich her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly\\ninclined to _embonpoint_.\\n\\nA moment after the fairy’s entrance the window was blown open by the\\nbreathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried\\nTinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy with the\\nfairy dust.\\n\\n“Tinker Bell,” he called softly, after making sure that the children\\nwere asleep, “Tink, where are you?” She was in a jug for the moment,\\nand liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.\\n\\n“Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put\\nmy shadow?”\\n\\nThe loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy\\nlanguage. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to\\nhear it you would know that you had heard it once before.\\n\\nTink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of\\ndrawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to\\nthe floor with both hands, as kings toss ha’pence to the crowd. In a\\nmoment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that\\nhe had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.\\n\\nIf he thought at all, but I don’t believe he ever thought, it was that\\nhe and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops\\nof water, and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it\\non with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed\\nthrough Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.\\n\\nHis sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see\\na stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly\\ninterested.\\n\\n“Boy,” she said courteously, “why are you crying?”\\n\\nPeter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner\\nat fairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was\\nmuch pleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed.\\n\\n“What’s your name?” he asked.\\n\\n“Wendy Moira Angela Darling,” she replied with some satisfaction. “What\\nis your name?”\\n\\n“Peter Pan.”\\n\\nShe was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a\\ncomparatively short name.\\n\\n“Is that all?”\\n\\n“Yes,” he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it was a\\nshortish name.\\n\\n“I’m so sorry,” said Wendy Moira Angela.\\n\\n“It doesn’t matter,” Peter gulped.\\n\\nShe asked where he lived.\\n\\n“Second to the right,” said Peter, “and then straight on till morning.”\\n\\n“What a funny address!”\\n\\nPeter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a\\nfunny address.\\n\\n“No, it isn’t,” he said.\\n\\n“I mean,” Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, “is that\\nwhat they put on the letters?”\\n\\nHe wished she had not mentioned letters.\\n\\n“Don’t get any letters,” he said contemptuously.\\n\\n“But your mother gets letters?”\\n\\n“Don’t have a mother,” he said. Not only had he no mother, but he had\\nnot the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very over-rated\\npersons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a\\ntragedy.\\n\\n“O Peter, no wonder you were crying,” she said, and got out of bed and\\nran to him.\\n\\n“I wasn’t crying about mothers,” he said rather indignantly. “I was\\ncrying because I can’t get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn’t\\ncrying.”\\n\\n“It has come off?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nThen Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she\\nwas frightfully sorry for Peter. “How awful!” she said, but she could\\nnot help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on\\nwith soap. How exactly like a boy!\\n\\nFortunately she knew at once what to do. “It must be sewn on,” she\\nsaid, just a little patronisingly.\\n\\n“What’s sewn?” he asked.\\n\\n“You’re dreadfully ignorant.”\\n\\n“No, I’m not.”\\n\\nBut she was exulting in his ignorance. “I shall sew it on for you, my\\nlittle man,” she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out\\nher housewife, and sewed the shadow on to Peter’s foot.\\n\\n“I daresay it will hurt a little,” she warned him.\\n\\n“Oh, I shan’t cry,” said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he\\nhad never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and did not cry,\\nand soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little\\ncreased.\\n\\n“Perhaps I should have ironed it,” Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter,\\nboylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about\\nin the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his\\nbliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. “How\\nclever I am!” he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”\\n\\nIt is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one\\nof his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness,\\nthere never was a cockier boy.\\n\\nBut for the moment Wendy was shocked. “You conceit,” she exclaimed,\\nwith frightful sarcasm; “of course I did nothing!”\\n\\n“You did a little,” Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.\\n\\n“A little!” she replied with hauteur; “if I am no use I can at least\\nwithdraw,” and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and\\ncovered her face with the blankets.\\n\\nTo induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this\\nfailed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his\\nfoot. “Wendy,” he said, “don’t withdraw. I can’t help crowing, Wendy,\\nwhen I’m pleased with myself.” Still she would not look up, though she\\nwas listening eagerly. “Wendy,” he continued, in a voice that no woman\\nhas ever yet been able to resist, “Wendy, one girl is more use than\\ntwenty boys.”\\n\\nNow Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many\\ninches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.\\n\\n“Do you really think so, Peter?”\\n\\n“Yes, I do.”\\n\\n“I think it’s perfectly sweet of you,” she declared, “and I’ll get up\\nagain,” and she sat with him on the side of the bed. She also said she\\nwould give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not know what she\\nmeant, and he held out his hand expectantly.\\n\\n“Surely you know what a kiss is?” she asked, aghast.\\n\\n“I shall know when you give it to me,” he replied stiffly, and not to\\nhurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.\\n\\n“Now,” said he, “shall I give you a kiss?” and she replied with a\\nslight primness, “If you please.” She made herself rather cheap by\\ninclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn button\\ninto her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been\\nbefore, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain\\naround her neck. It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it\\nwas afterwards to save her life.\\n\\nWhen people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask\\neach other’s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct\\nthing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question\\nto ask him; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when\\nwhat you want to be asked is Kings of England.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” he replied uneasily, “but I am quite young.” He really\\nknew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said at a\\nventure, “Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.”\\n\\nWendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the\\ncharming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he\\ncould sit nearer her.\\n\\n“It was because I heard father and mother,” he explained in a low\\nvoice, “talking about what I was to be when I became a man.” He was\\nextraordinarily agitated now. “I don’t want ever to be a man,” he said\\nwith passion. “I want always to be a little boy and to have fun. So I\\nran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the\\nfairies.”\\n\\nShe gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it\\nwas because he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies.\\nWendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as\\nquite delightful. She poured out questions about them, to his surprise,\\nfor they were rather a nuisance to him, getting in his way and so on,\\nand indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding. Still, he liked them\\non the whole, and he told her about the beginning of fairies.\\n\\n“You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its\\nlaugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about,\\nand that was the beginning of fairies.”\\n\\nTedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.\\n\\n“And so,” he went on good-naturedly, “there ought to be one fairy for\\nevery boy and girl.”\\n\\n“Ought to be? Isn’t there?”\\n\\n“No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don’t believe in\\nfairies, and every time a child says, ‘I don’t believe in fairies,’\\nthere is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.”\\n\\nReally, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it\\nstruck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. “I can’t think\\nwhere she has gone to,” he said, rising, and he called Tink by name.\\nWendy’s heart went flutter with a sudden thrill.\\n\\n“Peter,” she cried, clutching him, “you don’t mean to tell me that\\nthere is a fairy in this room!”\\n\\n“She was here just now,” he said a little impatiently. “You don’t hear\\nher, do you?” and they both listened.\\n\\n“The only sound I hear,” said Wendy, “is like a tinkle of bells.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s Tink, that’s the fairy language. I think I hear her too.”\\n\\nThe sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face.\\nNo one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of\\ngurgles was his laugh. He had his first laugh still.\\n\\n“Wendy,” he whispered gleefully, “I do believe I shut her up in the\\ndrawer!”\\n\\nHe let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery\\nscreaming with fury. “You shouldn’t say such things,” Peter retorted.\\n“Of course I’m very sorry, but how could I know you were in the\\ndrawer?”\\n\\nWendy was not listening to him. “O Peter,” she cried, “if she would\\nonly stand still and let me see her!”\\n\\n“They hardly ever stand still,” he said, but for one moment Wendy saw\\nthe romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. “O the lovely!”\\nshe cried, though Tink’s face was still distorted with passion.\\n\\n“Tink,” said Peter amiably, “this lady says she wishes you were her\\nfairy.”\\n\\nTinker Bell answered insolently.\\n\\n“What does she say, Peter?”\\n\\nHe had to translate. “She is not very polite. She says you are a great\\nugly girl, and that she is my fairy.”\\n\\nHe tried to argue with Tink. “You know you can’t be my fairy, Tink,\\nbecause I am an gentleman and you are a lady.”\\n\\nTo this Tink replied in these words, “You silly ass,” and disappeared\\ninto the bathroom. “She is quite a common fairy,” Peter explained\\napologetically, “she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots\\nand kettles.”\\n\\nThey were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him\\nwith more questions.\\n\\n“If you don’t live in Kensington Gardens now—”\\n\\n“Sometimes I do still.”\\n\\n“But where do you live mostly now?”\\n\\n“With the lost boys.”\\n\\n“Who are they?”\\n\\n“They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the\\nnurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days\\nthey are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I’m\\ncaptain.”\\n\\n“What fun it must be!”\\n\\n“Yes,” said cunning Peter, “but we are rather lonely. You see we have\\nno female companionship.”\\n\\n“Are none of the others girls?”\\n\\n“Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their\\nprams.”\\n\\nThis flattered Wendy immensely. “I think,” she said, “it is perfectly\\nlovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us.”\\n\\nFor reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one\\nkick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she\\ntold him with spirit that he was not captain in her house. However,\\nJohn continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him\\nto remain there. “And I know you meant to be kind,” she said,\\nrelenting, “so you may give me a kiss.”\\n\\nFor the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. “I thought\\nyou would want it back,” he said a little bitterly, and offered to\\nreturn her the thimble.\\n\\n“Oh dear,” said the nice Wendy, “I don’t mean a kiss, I mean a\\nthimble.”\\n\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\n“It’s like this.” She kissed him.\\n\\n“Funny!” said Peter gravely. “Now shall I give you a thimble?”\\n\\n“If you wish to,” said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.\\n\\nPeter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. “What is it,\\nWendy?”\\n\\n“It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.”\\n\\n“That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.”\\n\\nAnd indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.\\n\\n“She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you a\\nthimble.”\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n“Why, Tink?”\\n\\nAgain Tink replied, “You silly ass.” Peter could not understand why,\\nbut Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he\\nadmitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to\\nlisten to stories.\\n\\n“You see, I don’t know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any\\nstories.”\\n\\n“How perfectly awful,” Wendy said.\\n\\n“Do you know,” Peter asked “why swallows build in the eaves of houses?\\nIt is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you\\nsuch a lovely story.”\\n\\n“Which story was it?”\\n\\n“About the prince who couldn’t find the lady who wore the glass\\nslipper.”\\n\\n“Peter,” said Wendy excitedly, “that was Cinderella, and he found her,\\nand they lived happily ever after.”\\n\\nPeter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been\\nsitting, and hurried to the window.\\n\\n“Where are you going?” she cried with misgiving.\\n\\n“To tell the other boys.”\\n\\n“Don’t go Peter,” she entreated, “I know such lots of stories.”\\n\\nThose were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was\\nshe who first tempted him.\\n\\nHe came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought\\nto have alarmed her, but did not.\\n\\n“Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!” she cried, and then Peter\\ngripped her and began to draw her toward the window.\\n\\n“Let me go!” she ordered him.\\n\\n“Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.”\\n\\nOf course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, “Oh dear, I\\ncan’t. Think of mummy! Besides, I can’t fly.”\\n\\n“I’ll teach you.”\\n\\n“Oh, how lovely to fly.”\\n\\n“I’ll teach you how to jump on the wind’s back, and then away we go.”\\n\\n“Oo!” she exclaimed rapturously.\\n\\n“Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be\\nflying about with me saying funny things to the stars.”\\n\\n“Oo!”\\n\\n“And, Wendy, there are mermaids.”\\n\\n“Mermaids! With tails?”\\n\\n“Such long tails.”\\n\\n“Oh,” cried Wendy, “to see a mermaid!”\\n\\nHe had become frightfully cunning. “Wendy,” he said, “how we should all\\nrespect you.”\\n\\nShe was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were\\ntrying to remain on the nursery floor.\\n\\nBut he had no pity for her.\\n\\n“Wendy,” he said, the sly one, “you could tuck us in at night.”\\n\\n“Oo!”\\n\\n“None of us has ever been tucked in at night.”\\n\\n“Oo,” and her arms went out to him.\\n\\n“And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us\\nhas any pockets.”\\n\\nHow could she resist. “Of course it’s awfully fascinating!” she cried.\\n“Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?”\\n\\n“If you like,” he said indifferently, and she ran to John and Michael\\nand shook them. “Wake up,” she cried, “Peter Pan has come and he is to\\nteach us to fly.”\\n\\nJohn rubbed his eyes. “Then I shall get up,” he said. Of course he was\\non the floor already. “Hallo,” he said, “I am up!”\\n\\nMichael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six\\nblades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces\\nassumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the\\ngrown-up world. All was as still as salt. Then everything was right.\\nNo, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking\\ndistressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was her silence they\\nhad heard.\\n\\n“Out with the light! Hide! Quick!” cried John, taking command for the\\nonly time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered,\\nholding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you\\nwould have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing\\nangelically as they slept. They were really doing it artfully from\\nbehind the window curtains.\\n\\nLiza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in\\nthe kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her\\ncheek, by Nana’s absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting\\na little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in\\ncustody of course.\\n\\n“There, you suspicious brute,” she said, not sorry that Nana was in\\ndisgrace. “They are perfectly safe, aren’t they? Every one of the\\nlittle angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.”\\n\\nHere Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they\\nwere nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried\\nto drag herself out of Liza’s clutches.\\n\\nBut Liza was dense. “No more of it, Nana,” she said sternly, pulling\\nher out of the room. “I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight\\nfor master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh,\\nwon’t master whip you, just.”\\n\\nShe tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to\\nbark? Bring master and missus home from the party! Why, that was just\\nwhat she wanted. Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long\\nas her charges were safe? Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings,\\nand Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and\\nstrained at the chain until at last she broke it. In another moment she\\nhad burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven,\\nher most expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs. Darling\\nknew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery,\\nand without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.\\n\\nBut it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing\\nbehind the curtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.\\n\\nWe now return to the nursery.\\n\\n“It’s all right,” John announced, emerging from his hiding-place. “I\\nsay, Peter, can you really fly?”\\n\\nInstead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking\\nthe mantelpiece on the way.\\n\\n“How topping!” said John and Michael.\\n\\n“How sweet!” cried Wendy.\\n\\n“Yes, I’m sweet, oh, I am sweet!” said Peter, forgetting his manners\\nagain.\\n\\nIt looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and\\nthen from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.\\n\\n“I say, how do you do it?” asked John, rubbing his knee. He was quite a\\npractical boy.\\n\\n“You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,” Peter explained, “and they\\nlift you up in the air.”\\n\\nHe showed them again.\\n\\n“You’re so nippy at it,” John said, “couldn’t you do it very slowly\\nonce?”\\n\\nPeter did it both slowly and quickly. “I’ve got it now, Wendy!” cried\\nJohn, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch,\\nthough even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not\\nknow A from Z.\\n\\nOf course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless\\nthe fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have\\nmentioned, one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each\\nof them, with the most superb results.\\n\\n“Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,” he said, “and let go.”\\n\\nThey were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did\\nnot quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne\\nacross the room.\\n\\n“I flewed!” he screamed while still in mid-air.\\n\\nJohn let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.\\n\\n“Oh, lovely!”\\n\\n“Oh, ripping!”\\n\\n“Look at me!”\\n\\n“Look at me!”\\n\\n“Look at me!”\\n\\nThey were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a\\nlittle, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is\\nalmost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first,\\nbut had to desist, Tink was so indignant.\\n\\nUp and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy’s word.\\n\\n“I say,” cried John, “why shouldn’t we all go out?”\\n\\nOf course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.\\n\\nMichael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a\\nbillion miles. But Wendy hesitated.\\n\\n“Mermaids!” said Peter again.\\n\\n“Oo!”\\n\\n“And there are pirates.”\\n\\n“Pirates,” cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, “let us go at once.”\\n\\nIt was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana\\nout of 27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the\\nnursery window; and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze\\nwith light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, they could see in\\nshadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling\\nround and round, not on the floor but in the air.\\n\\nNot three figures, four!\\n\\nIn a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushed\\nupstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to\\nmake her heart go softly.\\n\\nWill they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them,\\nand we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story.\\nOn the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it\\nwill all come right in the end.\\n\\nThey would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the\\nlittle stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window\\nopen, and that smallest star of all called out:\\n\\n“Cave, Peter!”\\n\\nThen Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. “Come,” he cried\\nimperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John\\nand Michael and Wendy.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The\\nbirds were flown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IV.\\nTHE FLIGHT\\n\\n\\n“Second to the right, and straight on till morning.”\\n\\nThat, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even\\nbirds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not\\nhave sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said\\nanything that came into his head.\\n\\nAt first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the\\ndelights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires\\nor any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.\\n\\nJohn and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.\\n\\nThey recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought\\nthemselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.\\n\\nNot long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before\\nthis thought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was\\ntheir second sea and their third night.\\n\\nSometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold\\nand again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they\\nmerely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding\\nthem? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable\\nfor humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and\\nsnatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for\\nmiles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy\\nnoticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this\\nwas rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that\\nthere are other ways.\\n\\nCertainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that\\nwas a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful\\nthing was that Peter thought this funny.\\n\\n“There he goes again!” he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly\\ndropped like a stone.\\n\\n“Save him, save him!” cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel sea\\nfar below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch\\nMichael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way\\nhe did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it\\nwas his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human\\nlife. Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one\\nmoment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the\\npossibility that the next time you fell he would let you go.\\n\\nHe could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back\\nand floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light\\nthat if you got behind him and blew he went faster.\\n\\n“Do be more polite to him,” Wendy whispered to John, when they were\\nplaying “Follow my Leader.”\\n\\n“Then tell him to stop showing off,” said John.\\n\\nWhen playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and\\ntouch each shark’s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run\\nyour finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this\\nwith much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off,\\nespecially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.\\n\\n“You must be nice to him,” Wendy impressed on her brothers. “What could\\nwe do if he were to leave us!”\\n\\n“We could go back,” Michael said.\\n\\n“How could we ever find our way back without him?”\\n\\n“Well, then, we could go on,” said John.\\n\\n“That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we don’t\\nknow how to stop.”\\n\\nThis was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.\\n\\nJohn said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was\\nto go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must\\ncome back to their own window.\\n\\n“And who is to get food for us, John?”\\n\\n“I nipped a bit out of that eagle’s mouth pretty neatly, Wendy.”\\n\\n“After the twentieth try,” Wendy reminded him. “And even though we\\nbecame good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and\\nthings if he is not near to give us a hand.”\\n\\nIndeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly,\\nthough they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front\\nof them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they\\nbump into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage\\nround Michael’s forehead by this time.\\n\\nPeter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up\\nthere by themselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would\\nsuddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had\\nno share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he\\nhad been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or\\nhe would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not\\nbe able to say for certain what had been happening. It was really\\nrather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.\\n\\n“And if he forgets them so quickly,” Wendy argued, “how can we expect\\nthat he will go on remembering us?”\\n\\nIndeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least\\nnot well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes\\nas he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she\\nhad to call him by name.\\n\\n“I’m Wendy,” she said agitatedly.\\n\\nHe was very sorry. “I say, Wendy,” he whispered to her, “always if you\\nsee me forgetting you, just keep on saying ‘I’m Wendy,’ and then I’ll\\nremember.”\\n\\nOf course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he\\nshowed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their\\nway, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several\\ntimes and found that they could sleep thus with security. Indeed they\\nwould have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon\\nhe would cry in his captain voice, “We get off here.” So with\\noccasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the\\nNeverland; for after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more,\\nthey had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much\\nowing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was\\nlooking for them. It is only thus that any one may sight those magic\\nshores.\\n\\n“There it is,” said Peter calmly.\\n\\n“Where, where?”\\n\\n“Where all the arrows are pointing.”\\n\\nIndeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children,\\nall directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of\\ntheir way before leaving them for the night.\\n\\nWendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their\\nfirst sight of the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at\\nonce, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something\\nlong dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom they\\nwere returning home for the holidays.\\n\\n“John, there’s the lagoon.”\\n\\n“Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.”\\n\\n“I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!”\\n\\n“Look, Michael, there’s your cave!”\\n\\n“John, what’s that in the brushwood?”\\n\\n“It’s a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that’s your little\\nwhelp!”\\n\\n“There’s my boat, John, with her sides stove in!”\\n\\n“No, it isn’t. Why, we burned your boat.”\\n\\n“That’s her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the redskin\\ncamp!”\\n\\n“Where? Show me, and I’ll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they\\nare on the war-path.”\\n\\n“There, just across the Mysterious River.”\\n\\n“I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.”\\n\\nPeter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he\\nwanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not\\ntold you that anon fear fell upon them?\\n\\nIt came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.\\n\\nIn the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little\\ndark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it\\nand spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts\\nof prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty\\nthat you would win. You were quite glad that the night-lights were on.\\nYou even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over\\nhere, and that the Neverland was all make-believe.\\n\\nOf course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was\\nreal now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker\\nevery moment, and where was Nana?\\n\\nThey had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His\\ncareless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle\\nwent through them every time they touched his body. They were now over\\nthe fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their\\nfeet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had\\nbecome slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way\\nthrough hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had\\nbeaten on it with his fists.\\n\\n“They don’t want us to land,” he explained.\\n\\n“Who are they?” Wendy whispered, shuddering.\\n\\nBut he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his\\nshoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.\\n\\nSometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his\\nhand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that\\nthey seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he\\nwent on again.\\n\\nHis courage was almost appalling. “Would you like an adventure now,” he\\nsaid casually to John, “or would you like to have your tea first?”\\n\\nWendy said “tea first” quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in\\ngratitude, but the braver John hesitated.\\n\\n“What kind of adventure?” he asked cautiously.\\n\\n“There’s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,” Peter told\\nhim. “If you like, we’ll go down and kill him.”\\n\\n“I don’t see him,” John said after a long pause.\\n\\n“I do.”\\n\\n“Suppose,” John said, a little huskily, “he were to wake up.”\\n\\nPeter spoke indignantly. “You don’t think I would kill him while he was\\nsleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That’s the way I\\nalways do.”\\n\\n“I say! Do you kill many?”\\n\\n“Tons.”\\n\\nJohn said “How ripping,” but decided to have tea first. He asked if\\nthere were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had\\nnever known so many.\\n\\n“Who is captain now?”\\n\\n“Hook,” answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said that\\nhated word.\\n\\n“Jas. Hook?”\\n\\n“Ay.”\\n\\nThen indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps\\nonly, for they knew Hook’s reputation.\\n\\n“He was Blackbeard’s bo’sun,” John whispered huskily. “He is the worst\\nof them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid.”\\n\\n“That’s him,” said Peter.\\n\\n“What is he like? Is he big?”\\n\\n“He is not so big as he was.”\\n\\n“How do you mean?”\\n\\n“I cut off a bit of him.”\\n\\n“You!”\\n\\n“Yes, me,” said Peter sharply.\\n\\n“I wasn’t meaning to be disrespectful.”\\n\\n“Oh, all right.”\\n\\n“But, I say, what bit?”\\n\\n“His right hand.”\\n\\n“Then he can’t fight now?”\\n\\n“Oh, can’t he just!”\\n\\n“Left-hander?”\\n\\n“He has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws with it.”\\n\\n“Claws!”\\n\\n“I say, John,” said Peter.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Say, ‘Ay, ay, sir.’”\\n\\n“Ay, ay, sir.”\\n\\n“There is one thing,” Peter continued, “that every boy who serves under\\nme has to promise, and so must you.”\\n\\nJohn paled.\\n\\n“It is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him to me.”\\n\\n“I promise,” John said loyally.\\n\\nFor the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying\\nwith them, and in her light they could distinguish each other.\\nUnfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they, and so she had to go\\nround and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo.\\nWendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks.\\n\\n“She tells me,” he said, “that the pirates sighted us before the\\ndarkness came, and got Long Tom out.”\\n\\n“The big gun?”\\n\\n“Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we are\\nnear it they are sure to let fly.”\\n\\n“Wendy!”\\n\\n“John!”\\n\\n“Michael!”\\n\\n“Tell her to go away at once, Peter,” the three cried simultaneously,\\nbut he refused.\\n\\n“She thinks we have lost the way,” he replied stiffly, “and she is\\nrather frightened. You don’t think I would send her away all by herself\\nwhen she is frightened!”\\n\\nFor a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a\\nloving little pinch.\\n\\n“Then tell her,” Wendy begged, “to put out her light.”\\n\\n“She can’t put it out. That is about the only thing fairies can’t do.\\nIt just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the stars.”\\n\\n“Then tell her to sleep at once,” John almost ordered.\\n\\n“She can’t sleep except when she’s sleepy. It is the only other thing\\nfairies can’t do.”\\n\\n“Seems to me,” growled John, “these are the only two things worth\\ndoing.”\\n\\nHere he got a pinch, but not a loving one.\\n\\n“If only one of us had a pocket,” Peter said, “we could carry her in\\nit.” However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a\\npocket between the four of them.\\n\\nHe had a happy idea. John’s hat!\\n\\nTink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John\\ncarried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently\\nWendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he\\nflew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated\\nto be under an obligation to Wendy.\\n\\nIn the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on\\nin silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken\\nonce by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts\\ndrinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been\\nthe branches of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins\\nsharpening their knives.\\n\\nEven these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. “If\\nonly something would make a sound!” he cried.\\n\\nAs if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous\\ncrash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.\\n\\nThe roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to\\ncry savagely, “Where are they, where are they, where are they?”\\n\\nThus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an\\nisland of make-believe and the same island come true.\\n\\nWhen at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found\\nthemselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air\\nmechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.\\n\\n“Are you shot?” John whispered tremulously.\\n\\n“I haven’t tried yet,” Michael whispered back.\\n\\nWe know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried\\nby the wind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards\\nwith no companion but Tinker Bell.\\n\\nIt would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the\\nhat.\\n\\nI don’t know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had\\nplanned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began\\nto lure Wendy to her destruction.\\n\\nTink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the\\nother hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or\\nthe other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one\\nfeeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it\\nmust be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of\\nWendy. What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course\\nunderstand, and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded\\nkind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning “Follow me, and\\nall will be well.”\\n\\nWhat else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and\\nMichael, and got only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know\\nthat Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. And so,\\nbewildered, and now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to her\\ndoom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter V.\\nTHE ISLAND COME TRUE\\n\\n\\nFeeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke\\ninto life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is\\nbetter and was always used by Peter.\\n\\nIn his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take\\nan hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the\\nredskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and\\nlost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with\\nthe coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if\\nyou put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island\\nseething with life.\\n\\nOn this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as\\nfollows. The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out\\nlooking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the\\npirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins. They were\\ngoing round and round the island, but they did not meet because all\\nwere going at the same rate.\\n\\nAll wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night\\nwere out to greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of\\ncourse, in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when\\nthey seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins\\nthem out; but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins\\nas two. Let us pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them\\nas they steal by in single file, each with his hand on his dagger.\\n\\nThey are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they\\nwear the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so\\nround and furry that when they fall they roll. They have therefore\\nbecome very sure-footed.\\n\\nThe first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most\\nunfortunate of all that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures\\nthan any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when\\nhe had stepped round the corner; all would be quiet, he would take the\\nopportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and then\\nwhen he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This\\nill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance, but instead\\nof souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was quite the\\nhumblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for\\nyou to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if\\naccepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who\\nis bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool, and she thinks\\nyou are the most easily tricked of the boys. ’Ware Tinker Bell.\\n\\nWould that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and\\nhe passes by, biting his knuckles.\\n\\nNext comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts\\nwhistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes.\\nSlightly is the most conceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the\\ndays before he was lost, with their manners and customs, and this has\\ngiven his nose an offensive tilt. Curly is fourth; he is a pickle, and\\nso often has he had to deliver up his person when Peter said sternly,\\n“Stand forth the one who did this thing,” that now at the command he\\nstands forth automatically whether he has done it or not. Last come the\\nTwins, who cannot be described because we should be sure to be\\ndescribing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what twins were, and\\nhis band were not allowed to know anything he did not know, so these\\ntwo were always vague about themselves, and did their best to give\\nsatisfaction by keeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.\\n\\nThe boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause,\\nfor things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track.\\nWe hear them before they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful\\nsong:\\n\\n“Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,\\n    A-pirating we go,\\nAnd if we’re parted by a shot\\n    We’re sure to meet below!”\\n\\nA more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock.\\nHere, a little in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground\\nlistening, his great arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as\\nornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his name in letters\\nof blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao. That\\ngigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one\\nwith which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of\\nthe Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the same\\nBill Jukes who got six dozen on the _Walrus_ from Flint before he would\\ndrop the bag of moidores; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy’s\\nbrother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an\\nusher in a public school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and\\nSkylights (Morgan’s Skylights); and the Irish bo’sun Smee, an oddly\\ngenial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only\\nNon-conformist in Hook’s crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on\\nbackwards; and Robt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian\\nlong known and feared on the Spanish Main.\\n\\nIn the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting,\\nreclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is\\nsaid he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease\\nin a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men, and instead of a\\nright hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged\\nthem to increase their pace. As dogs this terrible man treated and\\naddressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person he was\\ncadaverous and blackavized, and his hair was dressed in long curls,\\nwhich at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a\\nsingularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes\\nwere of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy,\\nsave when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red\\nspots appeared in them and lit them up horribly. In manner, something\\nof the grand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even ripped you up\\nwith an air, and I have been told that he was a _raconteur_ of repute.\\nHe was never more sinister than when he was most polite, which is\\nprobably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his diction,\\neven when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his\\ndemeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of\\nindomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was\\nthe sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour.\\nIn dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of\\nCharles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career\\nthat he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his\\nmouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke\\ntwo cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his\\niron claw.\\n\\nLet us now kill a pirate, to show Hook’s method. Skylights will do. As\\nthey pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace\\ncollar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one\\nscreech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has\\nnot even taken the cigars from his mouth.\\n\\nSuch is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will\\nwin?\\n\\nOn the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path,\\nwhich is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every\\none of them with his eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and\\ntheir naked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around them are\\nscalps, of boys as well as of pirates, for these are the Piccaninny\\ntribe, and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the\\nHurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great Big Little Panther, a brave\\nof so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his\\nprogress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes\\nTiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is the most\\nbeautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies,\\ncoquettish, cold and amorous by turns; there is not a brave who would\\nnot have the wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a\\nhatchet. Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the\\nslightest noise. The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy\\nbreathing. The fact is that they are all a little fat just now after\\nthe heavy gorging, but in time they will work this off. For the moment,\\nhowever, it constitutes their chief danger.\\n\\nThe redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their\\nplace is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions,\\ntigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from\\nthem, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the\\nman-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. Their tongues\\nare hanging out, they are hungry to-night.\\n\\nWhen they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic\\ncrocodile. We shall see for whom she is looking presently.\\n\\nThe crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the\\nprocession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or\\nchanges its pace. Then quickly they will be on top of each other.\\n\\nAll are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the\\ndanger may be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island\\nwas.\\n\\nThe first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung\\nthemselves down on the sward, close to their underground home.\\n\\n“I do wish Peter would come back,” every one of them said nervously,\\nthough in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than\\ntheir captain.\\n\\n“I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,” Slightly said, in\\nthe tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps some\\ndistant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, “but I wish he would\\ncome back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about\\nCinderella.”\\n\\nThey talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother\\nmust have been very like her.\\n\\nIt was only in Peter’s absence that they could speak of mothers, the\\nsubject being forbidden by him as silly.\\n\\n“All I remember about my mother,” Nibs told them, “is that she often\\nsaid to my father, ‘Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!’ I\\ndon’t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my\\nmother one.”\\n\\nWhile they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild\\nthings of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and\\nit was the grim song:\\n\\n“Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,\\n    The flag o’ skull and bones,\\nA merry hour, a hempen rope,\\n    And hey for Davy Jones.”\\n\\nAt once the lost boys—but where are they? They are no longer there.\\nRabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.\\n\\nI will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has\\ndarted away to reconnoitre, they are already in their home under the\\nground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal\\npresently. But how have they reached it? for there is no entrance to be\\nseen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away, would\\ndisclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and you may note\\nthat there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its hollow\\ntrunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the home\\nunder the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many\\nmoons. Will he find it tonight?\\n\\nAs the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs\\ndisappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But\\nan iron claw gripped his shoulder.\\n\\n“Captain, let go!” he cried, writhing.\\n\\nNow for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.\\n“Put back that pistol first,” it said threateningly.\\n\\n“It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.”\\n\\n“Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily’s redskins upon us. Do\\nyou want to lose your scalp?”\\n\\n“Shall I after him, Captain,” asked pathetic Smee, “and tickle him with\\nJohnny Corkscrew?” Smee had pleasant names for everything, and his\\ncutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the wound. One\\ncould mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after killing,\\nit was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.\\n\\n“Johnny’s a silent fellow,” he reminded Hook.\\n\\n“Not now, Smee,” Hook said darkly. “He is only one, and I want to\\nmischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.”\\n\\nThe pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain\\nand Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it\\nwas, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but\\nthere came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo’sun the\\nstory of his life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all\\nabout Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.\\n\\nAnon he caught the word Peter.\\n\\n“Most of all,” Hook was saying passionately, “I want their captain,\\nPeter Pan. ’Twas he cut off my arm.” He brandished the hook\\nthreateningly. “I’ve waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I’ll\\ntear him!”\\n\\n“And yet,” said Smee, “I have often heard you say that hook was worth a\\nscore of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.”\\n\\n“Ay,” the captain answered, “if I was a mother I would pray to have my\\nchildren born with this instead of that,” and he cast a look of pride\\nupon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he\\nfrowned.\\n\\n“Peter flung my arm,” he said, wincing, “to a crocodile that happened\\nto be passing by.”\\n\\n“I have often,” said Smee, “noticed your strange dread of crocodiles.”\\n\\n“Not of crocodiles,” Hook corrected him, “but of that one crocodile.”\\nHe lowered his voice. “It liked my arm so much, Smee, that it has\\nfollowed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking\\nits lips for the rest of me.”\\n\\n“In a way,” said Smee, “it’s sort of a compliment.”\\n\\n“I want no such compliments,” Hook barked petulantly. “I want Peter\\nPan, who first gave the brute its taste for me.”\\n\\nHe sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his\\nvoice. “Smee,” he said huskily, “that crocodile would have had me\\nbefore this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick\\ntick inside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and\\nbolt.” He laughed, but in a hollow way.\\n\\n“Some day,” said Smee, “the clock will run down, and then he’ll get\\nyou.”\\n\\nHook wetted his dry lips. “Ay,” he said, “that’s the fear that haunts\\nme.”\\n\\nSince sitting down he had felt curiously warm. “Smee,” he said, “this\\nseat is hot.” He jumped up. “Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I’m burning.”\\n\\nThey examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on\\nthe mainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in\\ntheir hands, for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to\\nascend. The pirates looked at each other. “A chimney!” they both\\nexclaimed.\\n\\nThey had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It\\nwas the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were\\nin the neighbourhood.\\n\\nNot only smoke came out of it. There came also children’s voices, for\\nso safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily\\nchattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the\\nmushroom. They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven\\ntrees.\\n\\n“Did you hear them say Peter Pan’s from home?” Smee whispered,\\nfidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.\\n\\nHook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a\\ncurdling smile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it.\\n“Unrip your plan, captain,” he cried eagerly.\\n\\n“To return to the ship,” Hook replied slowly through his teeth, “and\\ncook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.\\nThere can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The\\nsilly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door\\napiece. That shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the\\nshore of the Mermaids’ Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about\\nthere, playing with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will\\ngobble it up, because, having no mother, they don’t know how dangerous\\n’tis to eat rich damp cake.” He burst into laughter, not hollow\\nlaughter now, but honest laughter. “Aha, they will die.”\\n\\nSmee had listened with growing admiration.\\n\\n“It’s the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!” he cried, and\\nin their exultation they danced and sang:\\n\\n“Avast, belay, when I appear,\\n    By fear they’re overtook;\\nNought’s left upon your bones when you\\n    Have shaken claws with Hook.”\\n\\nThey began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound\\nbroke in and stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a\\nleaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it\\nwas more distinct.\\n\\nTick tick tick tick!\\n\\nHook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.\\n\\n“The crocodile!” he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his bo’sun.\\n\\nIt was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now\\non the trail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.\\n\\nOnce more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night\\nwere not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their\\nmidst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were\\nhanging out; the baying of them was horrible.\\n\\n“Save me, save me!” cried Nibs, falling on the ground.\\n\\n“But what can we do, what can we do?”\\n\\nIt was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their\\nthoughts turned to him.\\n\\n“What would Peter do?” they cried simultaneously.\\n\\nAlmost in the same breath they cried, “Peter would look at them through\\nhis legs.”\\n\\nAnd then, “Let us do what Peter would do.”\\n\\nIt is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy\\nthey bent and looked through their legs. The next moment is the long\\none, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in\\nthe terrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails and fled.\\n\\nNow Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring\\neyes still saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.\\n\\n“I have seen a wonderfuller thing,” he cried, as they gathered round\\nhim eagerly. “A great white bird. It is flying this way.”\\n\\n“What kind of a bird, do you think?”\\n\\n“I don’t know,” Nibs said, awestruck, “but it looks so weary, and as it\\nflies it moans, ‘Poor Wendy.’”\\n\\n“Poor Wendy?”\\n\\n“I remember,” said Slightly instantly, “there are birds called\\nWendies.”\\n\\n“See, it comes!” cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.\\n\\nWendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry.\\nBut more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous\\nfairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting at\\nher victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time she\\ntouched.\\n\\n“Hullo, Tink,” cried the wondering boys.\\n\\nTink’s reply rang out: “Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy.”\\n\\nIt was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. “Let us do\\nwhat Peter wishes!” cried the simple boys. “Quick, bows and arrows!”\\n\\nAll but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with\\nhim, and Tink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.\\n\\n“Quick, Tootles, quick,” she screamed. “Peter will be so pleased.”\\n\\nTootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. “Out of the way, Tink,”\\nhe shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground with\\nan arrow in her breast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VI.\\nTHE LITTLE HOUSE\\n\\n\\nFoolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy’s body when\\nthe other boys sprang, armed, from their trees.\\n\\n“You are too late,” he cried proudly, “I have shot the Wendy. Peter\\nwill be so pleased with me.”\\n\\nOverhead Tinker Bell shouted “Silly ass!” and darted into hiding. The\\nothers did not hear her. They had crowded round Wendy, and as they\\nlooked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy’s heart had been\\nbeating they would all have heard it.\\n\\nSlightly was the first to speak. “This is no bird,” he said in a scared\\nvoice. “I think this must be a lady.”\\n\\n“A lady?” said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.\\n\\n“And we have killed her,” Nibs said hoarsely.\\n\\nThey all whipped off their caps.\\n\\n“Now I see,” Curly said: “Peter was bringing her to us.” He threw\\nhimself sorrowfully on the ground.\\n\\n“A lady to take care of us at last,” said one of the twins, “and you\\nhave killed her!”\\n\\nThey were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a\\nstep nearer them they turned from him.\\n\\nTootles’ face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now\\nthat had never been there before.\\n\\n“I did it,” he said, reflecting. “When ladies used to come to me in\\ndreams, I said, ‘Pretty mother, pretty mother.’ But when at last she\\nreally came, I shot her.”\\n\\nHe moved slowly away.\\n\\n“Don’t go,” they called in pity.\\n\\n“I must,” he answered, shaking; “I am so afraid of Peter.”\\n\\nIt was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the\\nheart of every one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow.\\n\\n“Peter!” they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled his\\nreturn.\\n\\n“Hide her,” they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. But\\nTootles stood aloof.\\n\\nAgain came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.\\n“Greetings, boys,” he cried, and mechanically they saluted, and then\\nagain was silence.\\n\\nHe frowned.\\n\\n“I am back,” he said hotly, “why do you not cheer?”\\n\\nThey opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked\\nit in his haste to tell the glorious tidings.\\n\\n“Great news, boys,” he cried, “I have brought at last a mother for you\\nall.”\\n\\nStill no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his\\nknees.\\n\\n“Have you not seen her?” asked Peter, becoming troubled. “She flew this\\nway.”\\n\\n“Ah me!” one voice said, and another said, “Oh, mournful day.”\\n\\nTootles rose. “Peter,” he said quietly, “I will show her to you,” and\\nwhen the others would still have hidden her he said, “Back, twins, let\\nPeter see.”\\n\\nSo they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a\\nlittle time he did not know what to do next.\\n\\n“She is dead,” he said uncomfortably. “Perhaps she is frightened at\\nbeing dead.”\\n\\nHe thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of\\nsight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. They would\\nall have been glad to follow if he had done this.\\n\\nBut there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band.\\n\\n“Whose arrow?” he demanded sternly.\\n\\n“Mine, Peter,” said Tootles on his knees.\\n\\n“Oh, dastard hand,” Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use it as a\\ndagger.\\n\\nTootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. “Strike, Peter,” he said\\nfirmly, “strike true.”\\n\\nTwice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. “I cannot\\nstrike,” he said with awe, “there is something stays my hand.”\\n\\nAll looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at\\nWendy.\\n\\n“It is she,” he cried, “the Wendy lady, see, her arm!”\\n\\nWonderful to relate, Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over her and\\nlistened reverently. “I think she said, ‘Poor Tootles,’” he whispered.\\n\\n“She lives,” Peter said briefly.\\n\\nSlightly cried instantly, “The Wendy lady lives.”\\n\\nThen Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had\\nput it on a chain that she wore round her neck.\\n\\n“See,” he said, “the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I gave\\nher. It has saved her life.”\\n\\n“I remember kisses,” Slightly interposed quickly, “let me see it. Ay,\\nthat’s a kiss.”\\n\\nPeter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so\\nthat he could show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer\\nyet, being still in a frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing\\nnote.\\n\\n“Listen to Tink,” said Curly, “she is crying because the Wendy lives.”\\n\\nThen they had to tell Peter of Tink’s crime, and almost never had they\\nseen him look so stern.\\n\\n“Listen, Tinker Bell,” he cried, “I am your friend no more. Begone from\\nme for ever.”\\n\\nShe flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not\\nuntil Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say,\\n“Well, not for ever, but for a whole week.”\\n\\nDo you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh\\ndear no, never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange,\\nand Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed them.\\n\\nBut what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?\\n\\n“Let us carry her down into the house,” Curly suggested.\\n\\n“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is what one does with ladies.”\\n\\n“No, no,” Peter said, “you must not touch her. It would not be\\nsufficiently respectful.”\\n\\n“That,” said Slightly, “is what I was thinking.”\\n\\n“But if she lies there,” Tootles said, “she will die.”\\n\\n“Ay, she will die,” Slightly admitted, “but there is no way out.”\\n\\n“Yes, there is,” cried Peter. “Let us build a little house round her.”\\n\\nThey were all delighted. “Quick,” he ordered them, “bring me each of\\nyou the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp.”\\n\\nIn a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding.\\nThey skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and\\nwhile they were at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they\\ndragged along the ground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up,\\nmoved another step and slept again.\\n\\n“John, John,” Michael would cry, “wake up! Where is Nana, John, and\\nmother?”\\n\\nAnd then John would rub his eyes and mutter, “It is true, we did fly.”\\n\\nYou may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.\\n\\n“Hullo, Peter,” they said.\\n\\n“Hullo,” replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them. He\\nwas very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how\\nlarge a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for\\nchairs and a table. John and Michael watched him.\\n\\n“Is Wendy asleep?” they asked.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“John,” Michael proposed, “let us wake her and get her to make supper\\nfor us,” but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying\\nbranches for the building of the house. “Look at them!” he cried.\\n\\n“Curly,” said Peter in his most captainy voice, “see that these boys\\nhelp in the building of the house.”\\n\\n“Ay, ay, sir.”\\n\\n“Build a house?” exclaimed John.\\n\\n“For the Wendy,” said Curly.\\n\\n“For Wendy?” John said, aghast. “Why, she is only a girl!”\\n\\n“That,” explained Curly, “is why we are her servants.”\\n\\n“You? Wendy’s servants!”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Peter, “and you also. Away with them.”\\n\\nThe astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.\\n“Chairs and a fender first,” Peter ordered. “Then we shall build a\\nhouse round them.”\\n\\n“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is how a house is built; it all comes back\\nto me.”\\n\\nPeter thought of everything. “Slightly,” he cried, “fetch a doctor.”\\n\\n“Ay, ay,” said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his head.\\nBut he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearing\\nJohn’s hat and looking solemn.\\n\\n“Please, sir,” said Peter, going to him, “are you a doctor?”\\n\\nThe difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that\\nthey knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were\\nexactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had\\nto make-believe that they had had their dinners.\\n\\nIf they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the\\nknuckles.\\n\\n“Yes, my little man,” Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped\\nknuckles.\\n\\n“Please, sir,” Peter explained, “a lady lies very ill.”\\n\\nShe was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.\\n\\n“Tut, tut, tut,” he said, “where does she lie?”\\n\\n“In yonder glade.”\\n\\n“I will put a glass thing in her mouth,” said Slightly, and he\\nmade-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment\\nwhen the glass thing was withdrawn.\\n\\n“How is she?” inquired Peter.\\n\\n“Tut, tut, tut,” said Slightly, “this has cured her.”\\n\\n“I am glad!” Peter cried.\\n\\n“I will call again in the evening,” Slightly said; “give her beef tea\\nout of a cup with a spout to it;” but after he had returned the hat to\\nJohn he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from a\\ndifficulty.\\n\\nIn the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost\\neverything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy’s feet.\\n\\n“If only we knew,” said one, “the kind of house she likes best.”\\n\\n“Peter,” shouted another, “she is moving in her sleep.”\\n\\n“Her mouth opens,” cried a third, looking respectfully into it. “Oh,\\nlovely!”\\n\\n“Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep,” said Peter. “Wendy, sing\\nthe kind of house you would like to have.”\\n\\nImmediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:\\n\\n“I wish I had a pretty house,\\n    The littlest ever seen,\\nWith funny little red walls\\n    And roof of mossy green.”\\n\\nThey gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the\\nbranches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground\\nwas carpeted with moss. As they rattled up the little house they broke\\ninto song themselves:\\n\\n“We’ve built the little walls and roof\\n    And made a lovely door,\\nSo tell us, mother Wendy,\\n    What are you wanting more?”\\n\\nTo this she answered greedily:\\n\\n“Oh, really next I think I’ll have\\n    Gay windows all about,\\nWith roses peeping in, you know,\\n    And babies peeping out.”\\n\\nWith a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves\\nwere the blinds. But roses—?\\n\\n“Roses,” cried Peter sternly.\\n\\nQuickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.\\n\\nBabies?\\n\\nTo prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:\\n\\n“We’ve made the roses peeping out,\\n    The babes are at the door,\\nWe cannot make ourselves, you know,\\n    ’Cos we’ve been made before.”\\n\\nPeter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his\\nown. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy\\nwithin, though, of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode\\nup and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle\\neyes. Just when it seemed absolutely finished:\\n\\n“There’s no knocker on the door,” he said.\\n\\nThey were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it\\nmade an excellent knocker.\\n\\nAbsolutely finished now, they thought.\\n\\nNot of bit of it. “There’s no chimney,” Peter said; “we must have a\\nchimney.”\\n\\n“It certainly does need a chimney,” said John importantly. This gave\\nPeter an idea. He snatched the hat off John’s head, knocked out the\\nbottom, and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to\\nhave such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke\\nimmediately began to come out of the hat.\\n\\nNow really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to\\nknock.\\n\\n“All look your best,” Peter warned them; “first impressions are awfully\\nimportant.”\\n\\nHe was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all\\ntoo busy looking their best.\\n\\nHe knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not\\na sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a\\nbranch and openly sneering.\\n\\nWhat the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a\\nlady, what would she be like?\\n\\nThe door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off\\ntheir hats.\\n\\nShe looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she\\nwould look.\\n\\n“Where am I?” she said.\\n\\nOf course Slightly was the first to get his word in. “Wendy lady,” he\\nsaid rapidly, “for you we built this house.”\\n\\n“Oh, say you’re pleased,” cried Nibs.\\n\\n“Lovely, darling house,” Wendy said, and they were the very words they\\nhad hoped she would say.\\n\\n“And we are your children,” cried the twins.\\n\\nThen all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, “O\\nWendy lady, be our mother.”\\n\\n“Ought I?” Wendy said, all shining. “Of course it’s frightfully\\nfascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real\\nexperience.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t matter,” said Peter, as if he were the only person\\npresent who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew\\nleast. “What we need is just a nice motherly person.”\\n\\n“Oh dear!” Wendy said, “you see, I feel that is exactly what I am.”\\n\\n“It is, it is,” they all cried; “we saw it at once.”\\n\\n“Very well,” she said, “I will do my best. Come inside at once, you\\nnaughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to\\nbed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.”\\n\\nIn they went; I don’t know how there was room for them, but you can\\nsqueeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many\\njoyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in\\nthe great bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that\\nnight in the little house, and Peter kept watch outside with drawn\\nsword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves\\nwere on the prowl. The little house looked so cosy and safe in the\\ndarkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds, and the\\nchimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a time\\nhe fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on\\ntheir way home from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the\\nfairy path at night they would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked\\nPeter’s nose and passed on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VII.\\nTHE HOME UNDER THE GROUND\\n\\n\\nOne of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and\\nJohn and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at\\nthe boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was\\nignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up\\nand down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you\\nfitted, you drew in your breath at the top, and down you went at\\nexactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out\\nalternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the\\naction you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and\\nnothing can be more graceful.\\n\\nBut you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as\\ncarefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the\\nclothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.\\nUsually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments\\nor too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only\\navailable tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and\\nafter that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on\\nfitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a\\nwhole family in perfect condition.\\n\\nWendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to\\nbe altered a little.\\n\\nAfter a few days’ practice they could go up and down as gaily as\\nbuckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under\\nthe ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all\\nhouses should do, with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to\\ngo fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming\\ncolour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in\\nthe centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through,\\nlevel with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high,\\nand then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table;\\nas soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus\\nthere was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was\\nin almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across\\nthis Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended\\nher washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down\\nat 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in\\nit, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict\\nrule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned\\nat once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have a baby,\\nand he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and\\nlong of it is that he was hung up in a basket.\\n\\nIt was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made\\nof an underground house in the same circumstances. But there was one\\nrecess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private\\napartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of the\\nhouse by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious, always\\nkept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could\\nhave had a more exquisite boudoir and bed-chamber combined. The couch,\\nas she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and\\nshe varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in\\nseason. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only\\nthree, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust\\nand reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth,\\nand the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and\\nRobin. There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the\\nthing, but of course she lit the residence herself. Tink was very\\ncontemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps\\ninevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited,\\nhaving the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.\\n\\nI suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those\\nrampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole\\nweeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was\\nnever above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the\\npot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she\\nhad to keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never\\nexactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe,\\nit all depended upon Peter’s whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was\\npart of a game, but he could not stodge just to feel stodgy, which is\\nwhat most children like better than anything else; the next best thing\\nbeing to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during a\\nmeal of it you could see him getting rounder. Of course it was trying,\\nbut you simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him\\nthat you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge.\\n\\nWendy’s favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all\\ngone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for\\nherself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting\\ndouble pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on\\ntheir knees.\\n\\nWhen she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a\\nhole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, “Oh dear, I am\\nsure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!”\\n\\nHer face beamed when she exclaimed this.\\n\\nYou remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she\\nhad come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into\\neach other’s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.\\n\\nAs time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had\\nleft behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite\\nimpossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is\\ncalculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them\\nthan on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry\\nabout her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they\\nwould always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave\\nher complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John\\nremembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while\\nMichael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.\\nThese things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she\\ntried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination\\npapers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.\\nThe other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on\\njoining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table,\\nwriting and thinking hard about the questions she had written on\\nanother slate and passed round. They were the most ordinary\\nquestions—“What was the colour of Mother’s eyes? Which was taller,\\nFather or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all three\\nquestions if possible.” “(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words\\non How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother\\ncompared. Only one of these to be attempted.” Or “(1) Describe Mother’s\\nlaugh; (2) Describe Father’s laugh; (3) Describe Mother’s Party Dress;\\n(4) Describe the Kennel and its Inmate.”\\n\\nThey were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not\\nanswer them you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful\\nwhat a number of crosses even John made. Of course the only boy who\\nreplied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more\\nhopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous,\\nand he really came out last: a melancholy thing.\\n\\nPeter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except\\nWendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could\\nneither write nor spell; not the smallest word. He was above all that\\nsort of thing.\\n\\nBy the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What was\\nthe colour of Mother’s eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been\\nforgetting, too.\\n\\nAdventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but\\nabout this time Peter invented, with Wendy’s help, a new game that\\nfascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in\\nit, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his\\ngames. It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the\\nsort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting\\non stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for\\nwalks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To\\nsee Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help\\nlooking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic\\nthing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his\\nhealth. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to\\nhim; and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also;\\notherwise he would have treated them severely.\\n\\nHe often went out alone, and when he came back you were never\\nabsolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might\\nhave forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then\\nwhen you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might\\nsay a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the body.\\nSometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed\\nover him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling\\ntale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however, many\\nadventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself,\\nand there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other\\nboys were in them and said they were wholly true. To describe them all\\nwould require a book as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English\\nDictionary, and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an\\naverage hour on the island. The difficulty is which one to choose.\\nShould we take the brush with the redskins at Slightly Gulch? It was a\\nsanguinary affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter’s\\npeculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he would\\nsuddenly change sides. At the Gulch, when victory was still in the\\nbalance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out,\\n“I’m redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?” And Tootles answered,\\n“Redskin; what are you, Nibs?” and Nibs said, “Redskin; what are you\\nTwin?” and so on; and they were all redskins; and of course this would\\nhave ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by Peter’s\\nmethods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at it they all\\nwent again, more fiercely than ever.\\n\\nThe extraordinary upshot of this adventure was—but we have not decided\\nyet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one\\nwould be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the\\nground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be\\npulled out like corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily’s\\nlife in the Mermaids’ Lagoon, and so made her his ally.\\n\\nOr we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might\\neat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after\\nanother; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children,\\nso that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone,\\nand was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.\\n\\nOr suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter’s friends, particularly\\nof the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how\\nthe nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and\\nPeter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty\\nstory, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell it\\nwe must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of\\ncourse be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter\\nadventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell’s attempt, with the\\nhelp of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a\\ngreat floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and\\nWendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we\\nmight choose Peter’s defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round\\nhim on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though\\nhe waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on\\nbreathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.\\n\\nWhich of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss\\nfor it.\\n\\nI have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that\\nthe gulch or the cake or Tink’s leaf had won. Of course I could do it\\nagain, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick\\nto the lagoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VIII.\\nTHE MERMAIDS’ LAGOON\\n\\n\\nIf you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a\\nshapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then\\nif you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and\\nthe colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on\\nfire. But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the\\nnearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment;\\nif there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the\\nmermaids singing.\\n\\nThe children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or\\nfloating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and\\nso forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on\\nfriendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy’s lasting\\nregrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil\\nword from one of them. When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon\\nshe might see them by the score, especially on Marooners’ Rock, where\\nthey loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite\\nirritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within\\na yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her\\nwith their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.\\n\\nThey treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who\\nchatted with them on Marooners’ Rock by the hour, and sat on their\\ntails when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.\\n\\nThe most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon,\\nwhen they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for\\nmortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy\\nhad never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course\\nPeter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules\\nabout every one being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon,\\nhowever, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in\\nextraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many\\ncolours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily\\nfrom one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the\\nrainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and\\nthe keepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of\\nthese games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a\\npretty sight.\\n\\nBut the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by\\nthemselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we\\nhave proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not\\nabove taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of\\nhitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids\\nadopted it. This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.\\n\\nIt must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a\\nrock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on their\\ndoing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was\\nmake-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened\\nin it, while she sat beside them and looked important.\\n\\nIt was one such day, and they were all on Marooners’ Rock. The rock was\\nnot much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how\\nnot to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with\\ntheir eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was\\nnot looking. She was very busy, stitching.\\n\\nWhile she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over\\nit, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning\\nit cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she\\nlooked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing\\nplace seemed formidable and unfriendly.\\n\\nIt was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as\\nnight had come. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent\\nthat shiver through the sea to say that it was coming. What was it?\\n\\nThere crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners’\\nRock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them\\nthere to drown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is\\nsubmerged.\\n\\nOf course she should have roused the children at once; not merely\\nbecause of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it\\nwas no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she\\nwas a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply\\nmust stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So,\\nthough fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would\\nnot waken them. Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though\\nher heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She stood over them\\nto let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?\\n\\nIt was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could\\nsniff danger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at\\nonce as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the others.\\n\\nHe stood motionless, one hand to his ear.\\n\\n“Pirates!” he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile was\\nplaying about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that\\nsmile was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was\\nto stand ready to obey. The order came sharp and incisive.\\n\\n“Dive!”\\n\\nThere was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.\\nMarooners’ Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were\\nitself marooned.\\n\\nThe boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in\\nher, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger\\nLily. Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her\\nfate. She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her\\nrace more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written\\nin the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the\\nhappy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter\\nof a chief, she must die as a chief’s daughter, it is enough.\\n\\nThey had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth.\\nNo watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook’s boast that the wind of\\nhis name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to\\nguard it also. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.\\n\\nIn the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see\\nthe rock till they crashed into it.\\n\\n“Luff, you lubber,” cried an Irish voice that was Smee’s; “here’s the\\nrock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it\\nand leave her here to drown.”\\n\\nIt was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the\\nrock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.\\n\\nQuite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and\\ndown, Peter’s and Wendy’s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first\\ntragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had\\nforgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was\\ntwo against one that angered him, and he meant to save her. An easy way\\nwould have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he was never\\none to choose the easy way.\\n\\nThere was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice\\nof Hook.\\n\\n“Ahoy there, you lubbers!” he called. It was a marvellous imitation.\\n\\n“The captain!” said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.\\n\\n“He must be swimming out to us,” Starkey said, when they had looked for\\nhim in vain.\\n\\n“We are putting the redskin on the rock,” Smee called out.\\n\\n“Set her free,” came the astonishing answer.\\n\\n“Free!”\\n\\n“Yes, cut her bonds and let her go.”\\n\\n“But, captain—”\\n\\n“At once, d’ye hear,” cried Peter, “or I’ll plunge my hook in you.”\\n\\n“This is queer!” Smee gasped.\\n\\n“Better do what the captain orders,” said Starkey nervously.\\n\\n“Ay, ay,” Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily’s cords. At once like an eel\\nshe slid between Starkey’s legs into the water.\\n\\nOf course Wendy was very elated over Peter’s cleverness; but she knew\\nthat he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray\\nhimself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was\\nstayed even in the act, for “Boat ahoy!” rang over the lagoon in Hook’s\\nvoice, and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.\\n\\nPeter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle\\nof surprise instead.\\n\\n“Boat ahoy!” again came the voice.\\n\\nNow Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.\\n\\nHe was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him\\nhe had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his\\nhook grip the boat’s side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose\\ndripping from the water, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim\\naway, but Peter would not budge. He was tingling with life and also\\ntop-heavy with conceit. “Am I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!” he\\nwhispered to her, and though she thought so also, she was really glad\\nfor the sake of his reputation that no one heard him except herself.\\n\\nHe signed to her to listen.\\n\\nThe two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their\\ncaptain to them, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of\\nprofound melancholy.\\n\\n“Captain, is all well?” they asked timidly, but he answered with a\\nhollow moan.\\n\\n“He sighs,” said Smee.\\n\\n“He sighs again,” said Starkey.\\n\\n“And yet a third time he sighs,” said Smee.\\n\\nThen at last he spoke passionately.\\n\\n“The game’s up,” he cried, “those boys have found a mother.”\\n\\nAffrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.\\n\\n“O evil day!” cried Starkey.\\n\\n“What’s a mother?” asked the ignorant Smee.\\n\\nWendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. “He doesn’t know!” and always\\nafter this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would be\\nher one.\\n\\nPeter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying,\\n“What was that?”\\n\\n“I heard nothing,” said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters,\\nand as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I\\nhave told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was\\nsitting on it.\\n\\n“See,” said Hook in answer to Smee’s question, “that is a mother. What\\na lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the\\nmother desert her eggs? No.”\\n\\nThere was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent\\ndays when—but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.\\n\\nSmee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but\\nthe more suspicious Starkey said, “If she is a mother, perhaps she is\\nhanging about here to help Peter.”\\n\\nHook winced. “Ay,” he said, “that is the fear that haunts me.”\\n\\nHe was roused from this dejection by Smee’s eager voice.\\n\\n“Captain,” said Smee, “could we not kidnap these boys’ mother and make\\nher our mother?”\\n\\n“It is a princely scheme,” cried Hook, and at once it took practical\\nshape in his great brain. “We will seize the children and carry them to\\nthe boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our\\nmother.”\\n\\nAgain Wendy forgot herself.\\n\\n“Never!” she cried, and bobbed.\\n\\n“What was that?”\\n\\nBut they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in\\nthe wind. “Do you agree, my bullies?” asked Hook.\\n\\n“There is my hand on it,” they both said.\\n\\n“And there is my hook. Swear.”\\n\\nThey all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook\\nremembered Tiger Lily.\\n\\n“Where is the redskin?” he demanded abruptly.\\n\\nHe had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of\\nthe moments.\\n\\n“That is all right, captain,” Smee answered complacently; “we let her\\ngo.”\\n\\n“Let her go!” cried Hook.\\n\\n“’Twas your own orders,” the bo’sun faltered.\\n\\n“You called over the water to us to let her go,” said Starkey.\\n\\n“Brimstone and gall,” thundered Hook, “what cozening is going on here!”\\nHis face had gone black with rage, but he saw that they believed their\\nwords, and he was startled. “Lads,” he said, shaking a little, “I gave\\nno such order.”\\n\\n“It is passing queer,” Smee said, and they all fidgeted uncomfortably.\\nHook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it.\\n\\n“Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,” he cried, “dost hear\\nme?”\\n\\nOf course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not. He\\nimmediately answered in Hook’s voice:\\n\\n“Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.”\\n\\nIn that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee\\nand Starkey clung to each other in terror.\\n\\n“Who are you, stranger? Speak!” Hook demanded.\\n\\n“I am James Hook,” replied the voice, “captain of the _Jolly Roger_.”\\n\\n“You are not; you are not,” Hook cried hoarsely.\\n\\n“Brimstone and gall,” the voice retorted, “say that again, and I’ll\\ncast anchor in you.”\\n\\nHook tried a more ingratiating manner. “If you are Hook,” he said\\nalmost humbly, “come tell me, who am I?”\\n\\n“A codfish,” replied the voice, “only a codfish.”\\n\\n“A codfish!” Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not till then,\\nthat his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from him.\\n\\n“Have we been captained all this time by a codfish!” they muttered. “It\\nis lowering to our pride.”\\n\\nThey were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had\\nbecome, he scarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was\\nnot their belief in him that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego\\nslipping from him. “Don’t desert me, bully,” he whispered hoarsely to\\nit.\\n\\nIn his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the\\ngreat pirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions. Suddenly he tried\\nthe guessing game.\\n\\n“Hook,” he called, “have you another voice?”\\n\\nNow Peter could never resist a game, and he answered blithely in his\\nown voice, “I have.”\\n\\n“And another name?”\\n\\n“Ay, ay.”\\n\\n“Vegetable?” asked Hook.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Mineral?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Animal?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Man?”\\n\\n“No!” This answer rang out scornfully.\\n\\n“Boy?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Ordinary boy?”\\n\\n“No!”\\n\\n“Wonderful boy?”\\n\\nTo Wendy’s pain the answer that rang out this time was “Yes.”\\n\\n“Are you in England?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Are you here?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nHook was completely puzzled. “You ask him some questions,” he said to\\nthe others, wiping his damp brow.\\n\\nSmee reflected. “I can’t think of a thing,” he said regretfully.\\n\\n“Can’t guess, can’t guess!” crowed Peter. “Do you give it up?”\\n\\nOf course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the\\nmiscreants saw their chance.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” they answered eagerly.\\n\\n“Well, then,” he cried, “I am Peter Pan.”\\n\\nPan!\\n\\nIn a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his\\nfaithful henchmen.\\n\\n“Now we have him,” Hook shouted. “Into the water, Smee. Starkey, mind\\nthe boat. Take him dead or alive!”\\n\\nHe leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter.\\n\\n“Are you ready, boys?”\\n\\n“Ay, ay,” from various parts of the lagoon.\\n\\n“Then lam into the pirates.”\\n\\nThe fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who\\ngallantly climbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce\\nstruggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate’s grasp. He\\nwriggled overboard and John leapt after him. The dinghy drifted away.\\n\\nHere and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of\\nsteel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at\\ntheir own side. The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib,\\nbut he was himself pinked in turn by Curly. Farther from the rock\\nStarkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard.\\n\\nWhere all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.\\n\\nThe others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing\\nfrom the pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water\\nround him, from which they fled like affrighted fishes.\\n\\nBut there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter\\nthat circle.\\n\\nStrangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock\\nto breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite\\nside. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather\\nthan climb. Neither knew that the other was coming. Each feeling for a\\ngrip met the other’s arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their\\nfaces were almost touching; so they met.\\n\\nSome of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell\\nto they had a sinking. Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would\\nadmit it. After all, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared.\\nBut Peter had no sinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he\\ngnashed his pretty teeth with joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife\\nfrom Hook’s belt and was about to drive it home, when he saw that he\\nwas higher up the rock than his foe. It would not have been fighting\\nfair. He gave the pirate a hand to help him up.\\n\\nIt was then that Hook bit him.\\n\\nNot the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made\\nhim quite helpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is\\naffected thus the first time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he\\nhas a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness. After you\\nhave been unfair to him he will love you again, but will never\\nafterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets over the first\\nunfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but he always forgot\\nit. I suppose that was the real difference between him and all the\\nrest.\\n\\nSo when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just\\nstare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.\\n\\nA few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking\\nwildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white\\nfear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary\\noccasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they\\nwere uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring\\nthe lagoon for them, calling them by name. They found the dinghy and\\nwent home in it, shouting “Peter, Wendy” as they went, but no answer\\ncame save mocking laughter from the mermaids. “They must be swimming\\nback or flying,” the boys concluded. They were not very anxious,\\nbecause they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled, boylike, because\\nthey would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy’s fault!\\n\\nWhen their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon,\\nand then a feeble cry.\\n\\n“Help, help!”\\n\\nTwo small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted\\nand lay on the boy’s arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the\\nrock and then lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that\\nthe water was rising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he\\ncould do no more.\\n\\nAs they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began\\npulling her softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him,\\nwoke with a start, and was just in time to draw her back. But he had to\\ntell her the truth.\\n\\n“We are on the rock, Wendy,” he said, “but it is growing smaller. Soon\\nthe water will be over it.”\\n\\nShe did not understand even now.\\n\\n“We must go,” she said, almost brightly.\\n\\n“Yes,” he answered faintly.\\n\\n“Shall we swim or fly, Peter?”\\n\\nHe had to tell her.\\n\\n“Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy,\\nwithout my help?”\\n\\nShe had to admit that she was too tired.\\n\\nHe moaned.\\n\\n“What is it?” she asked, anxious about him at once.\\n\\n“I can’t help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor swim.”\\n\\n“Do you mean we shall both be drowned?”\\n\\n“Look how the water is rising.”\\n\\nThey put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They\\nthought they would soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed\\nagainst Peter as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying\\ntimidly, “Can I be of any use?”\\n\\nIt was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It\\nhad torn itself out of his hand and floated away.\\n\\n“Michael’s kite,” Peter said without interest, but next moment he had\\nseized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.\\n\\n“It lifted Michael off the ground,” he cried; “why should it not carry\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Both of us!”\\n\\n“It can’t lift two; Michael and Curly tried.”\\n\\n“Let us draw lots,” Wendy said bravely.\\n\\n“And you a lady; never.” Already he had tied the tail round her. She\\nclung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a “Good-bye,\\nWendy,” he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borne\\nout of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon.\\n\\nThe rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of\\nlight tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a\\nsound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world:\\nthe mermaids calling to the moon.\\n\\nPeter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A\\ntremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on\\nthe sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them,\\nand Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the\\nrock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him.\\nIt was saying, “To die will be an awfully big adventure.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IX.\\nTHE NEVER BIRD\\n\\n\\nThe last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids\\nretiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far\\naway to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where\\nthey live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the\\nnicest houses on the mainland), and he heard the bells.\\n\\nSteadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to\\npass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only\\nthing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating paper,\\nperhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to\\ndrift ashore.\\n\\nPresently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon\\nthe lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide,\\nand sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to\\nthe weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece\\nof paper.\\n\\nIt was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making\\ndesperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in\\na way she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able\\nto some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter\\nrecognised her she was very exhausted. She had come to save him, to\\ngive him her nest, though there were eggs in it. I rather wonder at the\\nbird, for though he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes\\ntormented her. I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest\\nof them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth.\\n\\nShe called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her\\nwhat she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood the\\nother’s language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds\\nfreely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a\\nstory, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but\\ntruth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened. Well,\\nnot only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their\\nmanners.\\n\\n“I—want—you—to—get—into—the—nest,” the bird called, speaking as slowly\\nand distinctly as possible, “and—then—you—can—drift—ashore,\\nbut—I—am—too—tired—to—bring—it—any—nearer—so—you—must—try\\nto—swim—to—it.”\\n\\n“What are you quacking about?” Peter answered. “Why don’t you let the\\nnest drift as usual?”\\n\\n“I—want—you—” the bird said, and repeated it all over.\\n\\nThen Peter tried slow and distinct.\\n\\n“What—are—you—quacking—about?” and so on.\\n\\nThe Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.\\n\\n“You dunderheaded little jay!” she screamed, “Why don’t you do as I\\ntell you?”\\n\\nPeter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted\\nhotly:\\n\\n“So are you!”\\n\\nThen rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:\\n\\n“Shut up!”\\n\\n“Shut up!”\\n\\nNevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by\\none last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up\\nshe flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.\\n\\nThen at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks\\nto the bird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his\\nthanks, however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to\\nwatch him get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.\\n\\nThere were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and\\nreflected. The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see\\nthe last of them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.\\n\\nI forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock,\\ndriven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of\\nburied treasure. The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and\\nwhen in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds,\\npearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for\\nfood, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been\\nplayed upon them. The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung\\nhis hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. Peter put the\\neggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated beautifully.\\n\\nThe Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her\\nadmiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then\\nhe got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his\\nshirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the\\nhat and once more sat snugly on her eggs. She drifted in one direction,\\nand he was borne off in another, both cheering.\\n\\nOf course when Peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the\\nbird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that\\nshe abandoned the nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and\\noften Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter\\nfeelings watched the bird sitting on his hat. As we shall not see her\\nagain, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build\\nin that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take\\nan airing.\\n\\nGreat were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground\\nalmost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the\\nkite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest\\nadventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so\\ninflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up\\nstill longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in\\nhaving them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the\\nlateness of the hour, and cried, “To bed, to bed,” in a voice that had\\nto be obeyed. Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out\\nbandages to every one, and they played till bed-time at limping about\\nand carrying their arms in slings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter X.\\nTHE HAPPY HOME\\n\\n\\nOne important result of the brush on the lagoon was that it made the\\nredskins their friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful\\nfate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for\\nhim. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the\\nground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could\\nnot be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking the\\npipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.\\n\\nThey called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves before\\nhim; and he liked this tremendously, so that it was not really good for\\nhim.\\n\\n“The great white father,” he would say to them in a very lordly manner,\\nas they grovelled at his feet, “is glad to see the Piccaninny warriors\\nprotecting his wigwam from the pirates.”\\n\\n“Me Tiger Lily,” that lovely creature would reply. “Peter Pan save me,\\nme his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him.”\\n\\nShe was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his\\ndue, and he would answer condescendingly, “It is good. Peter Pan has\\nspoken.”\\n\\nAlways when he said, “Peter Pan has spoken,” it meant that they must\\nnow shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were\\nby no means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as\\njust ordinary braves. They said “How-do?” to them, and things like\\nthat; and what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all\\nright.\\n\\nSecretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too\\nloyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father. “Father\\nknows best,” she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her\\nprivate opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.\\n\\nWe have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the\\nNight of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day,\\nas if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now\\nthe redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below,\\nthe children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had\\ngone out to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to\\nfind the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.\\n\\nThe meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the\\nboard, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and\\nrecriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening. To\\nbe sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them\\ngrabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles\\nhad pushed their elbow. There was a fixed rule that they must never hit\\nback at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by\\nraising the right arm politely and saying, “I complain of so-and-so;”\\nbut what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too\\nmuch.\\n\\n“Silence,” cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them\\nthat they were not all to speak at once. “Is your mug empty, Slightly\\ndarling?”\\n\\n“Not quite empty, mummy,” Slightly said, after looking into an\\nimaginary mug.\\n\\n“He hasn’t even begun to drink his milk,” Nibs interposed.\\n\\nThis was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.\\n\\n“I complain of Nibs,” he cried promptly.\\n\\nJohn, however, had held up his hand first.\\n\\n“Well, John?”\\n\\n“May I sit in Peter’s chair, as he is not here?”\\n\\n“Sit in father’s chair, John!” Wendy was scandalised. “Certainly not.”\\n\\n“He is not really our father,” John answered. “He didn’t even know how\\na father does till I showed him.”\\n\\nThis was grumbling. “We complain of John,” cried the twins.\\n\\nTootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them, indeed\\nhe was the only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him.\\n\\n“I don’t suppose,” Tootles said diffidently, “that I could be father.”\\n\\n“No, Tootles.”\\n\\nOnce Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way of\\ngoing on.\\n\\n“As I can’t be father,” he said heavily, “I don’t suppose, Michael, you\\nwould let me be baby?”\\n\\n“No, I won’t,” Michael rapped out. He was already in his basket.\\n\\n“As I can’t be baby,” Tootles said, getting heavier and heavier and\\nheavier, “do you think I could be a twin?”\\n\\n“No, indeed,” replied the twins; “it’s awfully difficult to be a twin.”\\n\\n“As I can’t be anything important,” said Tootles, “would any of you\\nlike to see me do a trick?”\\n\\n“No,” they all replied.\\n\\nThen at last he stopped. “I hadn’t really any hope,” he said.\\n\\nThe hateful telling broke out again.\\n\\n“Slightly is coughing on the table.”\\n\\n“The twins began with cheese-cakes.”\\n\\n“Curly is taking both butter and honey.”\\n\\n“Nibs is speaking with his mouth full.”\\n\\n“I complain of the twins.”\\n\\n“I complain of Curly.”\\n\\n“I complain of Nibs.”\\n\\n“Oh dear, oh dear,” cried Wendy, “I’m sure I sometimes think that\\nspinsters are to be envied.”\\n\\nShe told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy\\nload of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual.\\n\\n“Wendy,” remonstrated Michael, “I’m too big for a cradle.”\\n\\n“I must have somebody in a cradle,” she said almost tartly, “and you\\nare the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a\\nhouse.”\\n\\nWhile she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces and\\ndancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very\\nfamiliar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking\\non it for the last time.\\n\\nThere was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to\\nrecognize it.\\n\\n“Children, I hear your father’s step. He likes you to meet him at the\\ndoor.”\\n\\nAbove, the redskins crouched before Peter.\\n\\n“Watch well, braves. I have spoken.”\\n\\nAnd then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his\\ntree. As so often before, but never again.\\n\\nHe had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy.\\n\\n“Peter, you just spoil them, you know,” Wendy simpered.\\n\\n“Ah, old lady,” said Peter, hanging up his gun.\\n\\n“It was me told him mothers are called old lady,” Michael whispered to\\nCurly.\\n\\n“I complain of Michael,” said Curly instantly.\\n\\nThe first twin came to Peter. “Father, we want to dance.”\\n\\n“Dance away, my little man,” said Peter, who was in high good humour.\\n\\n“But we want you to dance.”\\n\\nPeter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to be\\nscandalised.\\n\\n“Me! My old bones would rattle!”\\n\\n“And mummy too.”\\n\\n“What,” cried Wendy, “the mother of such an armful, dance!”\\n\\n“But on a Saturday night,” Slightly insinuated.\\n\\nIt was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they\\nhad long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do\\nanything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did\\nit.\\n\\n“Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,” Wendy said, relenting.\\n\\n“People of our figure, Wendy!”\\n\\n“But it is only among our own progeny.”\\n\\n“True, true.”\\n\\nSo they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties\\nfirst.\\n\\n“Ah, old lady,” Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire\\nand looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, “there is nothing\\nmore pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day’s toil is over\\nthan to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.”\\n\\n“It is sweet, Peter, isn’t it?” Wendy said, frightfully gratified.\\n“Peter, I think Curly has your nose.”\\n\\n“Michael takes after you.”\\n\\nShe went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.\\n\\n“Dear Peter,” she said, “with such a large family, of course, I have\\nnow passed my best, but you don’t want to change me, do you?”\\n\\n“No, Wendy.”\\n\\nCertainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably,\\nblinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.\\n\\n“Peter, what is it?”\\n\\n“I was just thinking,” he said, a little scared. “It is only\\nmake-believe, isn’t it, that I am their father?”\\n\\n“Oh yes,” Wendy said primly.\\n\\n“You see,” he continued apologetically, “it would make me seem so old\\nto be their real father.”\\n\\n“But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.”\\n\\n“But not really, Wendy?” he asked anxiously.\\n\\n“Not if you don’t wish it,” she replied; and she distinctly heard his\\nsigh of relief. “Peter,” she asked, trying to speak firmly, “what are\\nyour exact feelings to me?”\\n\\n“Those of a devoted son, Wendy.”\\n\\n“I thought so,” she said, and went and sat by herself at the extreme\\nend of the room.\\n\\n“You are so queer,” he said, frankly puzzled, “and Tiger Lily is just\\nthe same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it is\\nnot my mother.”\\n\\n“No, indeed, it is not,” Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. Now we\\nknow why she was prejudiced against the redskins.\\n\\n“Then what is it?”\\n\\n“It isn’t for a lady to tell.”\\n\\n“Oh, very well,” Peter said, a little nettled. “Perhaps Tinker Bell\\nwill tell me.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,” Wendy retorted scornfully. “She is\\nan abandoned little creature.”\\n\\nHere Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out\\nsomething impudent.\\n\\n“She says she glories in being abandoned,” Peter interpreted.\\n\\nHe had a sudden idea. “Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?”\\n\\n“You silly ass!” cried Tinker Bell in a passion.\\n\\nShe had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.\\n\\n“I almost agree with her,” Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But she\\nhad been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the\\nnight was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.\\n\\nNone of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance\\ngave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on\\nthe island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it.\\nThey sang and danced in their night-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy\\nsong it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own\\nshadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them,\\nfrom whom they would shrink in real fear. So uproariously gay was the\\ndance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! It\\nwas a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the\\npillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may\\nnever meet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy’s\\ngood-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but\\nthe beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the\\nothers but himself, and he said gloomily:\\n\\n“Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the\\nend.”\\n\\nAnd then at last they all got into bed for Wendy’s story, the story\\nthey loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell\\nthis story he left the room or put his hands over his ears; and\\npossibly if he had done either of those things this time they might all\\nstill be on the island. But to-night he remained on his stool; and we\\nshall see what happened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XI.\\nWENDY’S STORY\\n\\n\\n“Listen, then,” said Wendy, settling down to her story, with Michael at\\nher feet and seven boys in the bed. “There was once a gentleman—”\\n\\n“I had rather he had been a lady,” Curly said.\\n\\n“I wish he had been a white rat,” said Nibs.\\n\\n“Quiet,” their mother admonished them. “There was a lady also, and—”\\n\\n“Oh, mummy,” cried the first twin, “you mean that there is a lady also,\\ndon’t you? She is not dead, is she?”\\n\\n“Oh, no.”\\n\\n“I am awfully glad she isn’t dead,” said Tootles. “Are you glad, John?”\\n\\n“Of course I am.”\\n\\n“Are you glad, Nibs?”\\n\\n“Rather.”\\n\\n“Are you glad, Twins?”\\n\\n“We are glad.”\\n\\n“Oh dear,” sighed Wendy.\\n\\n“Little less noise there,” Peter called out, determined that she should\\nhave fair play, however beastly a story it might be in his opinion.\\n\\n“The gentleman’s name,” Wendy continued, “was Mr. Darling, and her name\\nwas Mrs. Darling.”\\n\\n“I knew them,” John said, to annoy the others.\\n\\n“I think I knew them,” said Michael rather doubtfully.\\n\\n“They were married, you know,” explained Wendy, “and what do you think\\nthey had?”\\n\\n“White rats,” cried Nibs, inspired.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“It’s awfully puzzling,” said Tootles, who knew the story by heart.\\n\\n“Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants.”\\n\\n“What is descendants?”\\n\\n“Well, you are one, Twin.”\\n\\n“Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant.”\\n\\n“Descendants are only children,” said John.\\n\\n“Oh dear, oh dear,” sighed Wendy. “Now these three children had a\\nfaithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and\\nchained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.”\\n\\n“It’s an awfully good story,” said Nibs.\\n\\n“They flew away,” Wendy continued, “to the Neverland, where the lost\\nchildren are.”\\n\\n“I just thought they did,” Curly broke in excitedly. “I don’t know how\\nit is, but I just thought they did!”\\n\\n“O Wendy,” cried Tootles, “was one of the lost children called\\nTootles?”\\n\\n“Yes, he was.”\\n\\n“I am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs.”\\n\\n“Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents\\nwith all their children flown away.”\\n\\n“Oo!” they all moaned, though they were not really considering the\\nfeelings of the unhappy parents one jot.\\n\\n“Think of the empty beds!”\\n\\n“Oo!”\\n\\n“It’s awfully sad,” the first twin said cheerfully.\\n\\n“I don’t see how it can have a happy ending,” said the second twin. “Do\\nyou, Nibs?”\\n\\n“I’m frightfully anxious.”\\n\\n“If you knew how great is a mother’s love,” Wendy told them\\ntriumphantly, “you would have no fear.” She had now come to the part\\nthat Peter hated.\\n\\n“I do like a mother’s love,” said Tootles, hitting Nibs with a pillow.\\n“Do you like a mother’s love, Nibs?”\\n\\n“I do just,” said Nibs, hitting back.\\n\\n“You see,” Wendy said complacently, “our heroine knew that the mother\\nwould always leave the window open for her children to fly back by; so\\nthey stayed away for years and had a lovely time.”\\n\\n“Did they ever go back?”\\n\\n“Let us now,” said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest effort,\\n“take a peep into the future;” and they all gave themselves the twist\\nthat makes peeps into the future easier. “Years have rolled by, and who\\nis this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?”\\n\\n“O Wendy, who is she?” cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if he didn’t\\nknow.\\n\\n“Can it be—yes—no—it is—the fair Wendy!”\\n\\n“Oh!”\\n\\n“And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown\\nto man’s estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!”\\n\\n“Oh!”\\n\\n“‘See, dear brothers,’ says Wendy pointing upwards, ‘there is the\\nwindow still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our sublime\\nfaith in a mother’s love.’ So up they flew to their mummy and daddy,\\nand pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we draw a veil.”\\n\\nThat was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair\\nnarrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip\\nlike the most heartless things in the world, which is what children\\nare, but so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish time, and then\\nwhen we have need of special attention we nobly return for it,\\nconfident that we shall be rewarded instead of smacked.\\n\\nSo great indeed was their faith in a mother’s love that they felt they\\ncould afford to be callous for a bit longer.\\n\\nBut there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he\\nuttered a hollow groan.\\n\\n“What is it, Peter?” she cried, running to him, thinking he was ill.\\nShe felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. “Where is it,\\nPeter?”\\n\\n“It isn’t that kind of pain,” Peter replied darkly.\\n\\n“Then what kind is it?”\\n\\n“Wendy, you are wrong about mothers.”\\n\\nThey all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation;\\nand with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.\\n\\n“Long ago,” he said, “I thought like you that my mother would always\\nkeep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and\\nmoons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had\\nforgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my\\nbed.”\\n\\nI am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it\\nscared them.\\n\\n“Are you sure mothers are like that?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nSo this was the truth about mothers. The toads!\\n\\nStill it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child\\nwhen he should give in. “Wendy, let us go home,” cried John and Michael\\ntogether.\\n\\n“Yes,” she said, clutching them.\\n\\n“Not to-night?” asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in what they\\ncalled their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother,\\nand that it is only the mothers who think you can’t.\\n\\n“At once,” Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come\\nto her: “Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.”\\n\\nThis dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter’s feelings, and she\\nsaid to him rather sharply, “Peter, will you make the necessary\\narrangements?”\\n\\n“If you wish it,” he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him to pass\\nthe nuts.\\n\\nNot so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind\\nthe parting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he.\\n\\nBut of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath against\\ngrown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he\\ngot inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at\\nthe rate of about five to a second. He did this because there is a\\nsaying in the Neverland that, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies;\\nand Peter was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible.\\n\\nThen having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he\\nreturned to the home, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his\\nabsence. Panic-stricken at the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys\\nhad advanced upon her threateningly.\\n\\n“It will be worse than before she came,” they cried.\\n\\n“We shan’t let her go.”\\n\\n“Let’s keep her prisoner.”\\n\\n“Ay, chain her up.”\\n\\nIn her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn.\\n\\n“Tootles,” she cried, “I appeal to you.”\\n\\nWas it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.\\n\\nGrandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped\\nhis silliness and spoke with dignity.\\n\\n“I am just Tootles,” he said, “and nobody minds me. But the first who\\ndoes not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him\\nseverely.”\\n\\nHe drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The\\nothers held back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once\\nthat they would get no support from him. He would keep no girl in the\\nNeverland against her will.\\n\\n“Wendy,” he said, striding up and down, “I have asked the redskins to\\nguide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Peter.”\\n\\n“Then,” he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be\\nobeyed, “Tinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her, Nibs.”\\n\\nNibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really\\nbeen sitting up in bed listening for some time.\\n\\n“Who are you? How dare you? Go away,” she cried.\\n\\n“You are to get up, Tink,” Nibs called, “and take Wendy on a journey.”\\n\\nOf course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she\\nwas jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in\\nstill more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.\\n\\n“She says she won’t!” Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination,\\nwhereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady’s chamber.\\n\\n“Tink,” he rapped out, “if you don’t get up and dress at once I will\\nopen the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your _negligée_.”\\n\\nThis made her leap to the floor. “Who said I wasn’t getting up?” she\\ncried.\\n\\nIn the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now\\nequipped with John and Michael for the journey. By this time they were\\ndejected, not merely because they were about to lose her, but also\\nbecause they felt that she was going off to something nice to which\\nthey had not been invited. Novelty was beckoning to them as usual.\\n\\nCrediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.\\n\\n“Dear ones,” she said, “if you will all come with me I feel almost sure\\nI can get my father and mother to adopt you.”\\n\\nThe invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was\\nthinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.\\n\\n“But won’t they think us rather a handful?” Nibs asked in the middle of\\nhis jump.\\n\\n“Oh no,” said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, “it will only mean having\\na few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the screens\\non first Thursdays.”\\n\\n“Peter, can we go?” they all cried imploringly. They took it for\\ngranted that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely\\ncared. Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert\\ntheir dearest ones.\\n\\n“All right,” Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately they\\nrushed to get their things.\\n\\n“And now, Peter,” Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right, “I\\nam going to give you your medicine before you go.” She loved to give\\nthem medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was\\nonly water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle\\nand counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On\\nthis occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught, for just as\\nshe had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her heart\\nsink.\\n\\n“Get your things, Peter,” she cried, shaking.\\n\\n“No,” he answered, pretending indifference, “I am not going with you,\\nWendy.”\\n\\n“Yes, Peter.”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\nTo show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and\\ndown the room, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run\\nabout after him, though it was rather undignified.\\n\\n“To find your mother,” she coaxed.\\n\\nNow, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He\\ncould do very well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered\\nonly their bad points.\\n\\n“No, no,” he told Wendy decisively; “perhaps she would say I was old,\\nand I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.”\\n\\n“But, Peter—”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\nAnd so the others had to be told.\\n\\n“Peter isn’t coming.”\\n\\nPeter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their\\nbacks, and on each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if\\nPeter was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them\\ngo.\\n\\nBut he was far too proud for that. “If you find your mothers,” he said\\ndarkly, “I hope you will like them.”\\n\\nThe awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most\\nof them began to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said,\\nwere they not noodles to want to go?\\n\\n“Now then,” cried Peter, “no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy;” and\\nhe held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for\\nhe had something important to do.\\n\\nShe had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would\\nprefer a thimble.\\n\\n“You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?” she said,\\nlingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And you will take your medicine?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nThat seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter,\\nhowever, was not the kind that breaks down before other people. “Are\\nyou ready, Tinker Bell?” he called out.\\n\\n“Ay, ay.”\\n\\n“Then lead the way.”\\n\\nTink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was at\\nthis moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the\\nredskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with\\nshrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths\\nopened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were\\nextended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly\\nblown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely not to desert\\nthem. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he thought he had\\nslain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XII.\\nTHE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF\\n\\n\\nThe pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the\\nunscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins\\nfairly is beyond the wit of the white man.\\n\\nBy all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin\\nwho attacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before\\nthe dawn, at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its\\nlowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on\\nthe summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream\\nruns, for it is destruction to be too far from water. There they await\\nthe onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and\\ntreading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just\\nbefore the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts\\nwriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The\\nbrushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has\\ndived. Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a\\nwonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is\\nanswered by other braves; and some of them do it even better than the\\ncoyotes, who are not very good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and\\nthe long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live\\nthrough it for the first time; but to the trained hand those ghastly\\ncalls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the\\nnight is marching.\\n\\nThat this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in\\ndisregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.\\n\\nThe Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and\\ntheir whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his.\\nThey left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of\\ntheir tribe. With that alertness of the senses which is at once the\\nmarvel and despair of civilised peoples, they knew that the pirates\\nwere on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick; and\\nin an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began. Every foot\\nof ground between the spot where Hook had landed his forces and the\\nhome under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their\\nmocassins with the heels in front. They found only one hillock with a\\nstream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must establish\\nhimself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped\\nout with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins\\nfolded their blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is\\nto them, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children’s home,\\nawaiting the cold moment when they should deal pale death.\\n\\nHere dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which\\nthey were to put him at break of day, those confiding savages were\\nfound by the treacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by\\nsuch of the scouts as escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to\\nhave paused at the rising ground, though it is certain that in that\\ngrey light he must have seen it: no thought of waiting to be attacked\\nappears from first to last to have visited his subtle mind; he would\\nnot even hold off till the night was nearly spent; on he pounded with\\nno policy but to fall to. What could the bewildered scouts do, masters\\nas they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot\\nhelplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they\\ngave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry.\\n\\nAround the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and\\nthey suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell\\nfrom their eyes then the film through which they had looked at victory.\\nNo more would they torture at the stake. For them the happy\\nhunting-grounds was now. They knew it; but as their father’s sons they\\nacquitted themselves. Even then they had time to gather in a phalanx\\nthat would have been hard to break had they risen quickly, but this\\nthey were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. It is\\nwritten that the noble savage must never express surprise in the\\npresence of the white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the\\npirates must have been to them, they remained stationary for a moment,\\nnot a muscle moving; as if the foe had come by invitation. Then,\\nindeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and\\nthe air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too late.\\n\\nIt is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a\\nfight. Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not\\nall unavenged did they die, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to\\ndisturb the Spanish Main no more, and among others who bit the dust\\nwere Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the Alsatian Foggerty. Turley fell\\nto the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who ultimately cut a way\\nthrough the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe.\\n\\nTo what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for\\nthe historian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the\\nproper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered; and in\\njudging him it is only fair to take this into account. What he should\\nperhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to\\nfollow a new method. On the other hand, this, as destroying the element\\nof surprise, would have made his strategy of no avail, so that the\\nwhole question is beset with difficulties. One cannot at least withhold\\na reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme,\\nand the fell genius with which it was carried out.\\n\\nWhat were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment?\\nFain would his dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their\\ncutlasses, they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and\\nsquinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation\\nmust have been in his heart, but his face did not reflect it: ever a\\ndark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof from his followers in spirit\\nas in substance.\\n\\nThe night’s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had\\ncome out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he\\nshould get at the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their\\nband, but chiefly Pan.\\n\\nPeter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man’s hatred\\nof him. True he had flung Hook’s arm to the crocodile, but even this\\nand the increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to the\\ncrocodile’s pertinacity, hardly account for a vindictiveness so\\nrelentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about\\nPeter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his\\ncourage, it was not his engaging appearance, it was not—. There is no\\nbeating about the bush, for we know quite well what it was, and have\\ngot to tell. It was Peter’s cockiness.\\n\\nThis had got on Hook’s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at\\nnight it disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured\\nman felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.\\n\\nThe question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs\\ndown? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest\\nones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple\\nto ram them down with poles.\\n\\nIn the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang\\nof the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all\\nappealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as\\ntheir mouths close, and their arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium\\nabove has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce\\ngust of wind; but they know that in the passing it has determined their\\nfate.\\n\\nWhich side had won?\\n\\nThe pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the\\nquestion put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter’s answer.\\n\\n“If the redskins have won,” he said, “they will beat the tom-tom; it is\\nalways their sign of victory.”\\n\\nNow Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.\\n“You will never hear the tom-tom again,” he muttered, but inaudibly of\\ncourse, for strict silence had been enjoined. To his amazement Hook\\nsigned him to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an\\nunderstanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably,\\nhad this simple man admired Hook so much.\\n\\nTwice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen\\ngleefully.\\n\\n“The tom-tom,” the miscreants heard Peter cry; “an Indian victory!”\\n\\nThe doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black\\nhearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to\\nPeter. This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were\\nswallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the\\ntrees. They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and\\nsilently Hook gave his orders: one man to each tree, and the others to\\narrange themselves in a line two yards apart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIII.\\nDO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?\\n\\n\\nThe more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to\\nemerge from his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of\\nCecco, who flung him to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him\\nto Bill Jukes, who flung him to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one\\nto another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate. All the boys\\nwere plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner; and several of\\nthem were in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to\\nhand.\\n\\nA different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With\\nironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his\\narm, escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged. He\\ndid it with such an air, he was so frightfully _distingué_, that she\\nwas too fascinated to cry out. She was only a little girl.\\n\\nPerhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced\\nher, and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results.\\nHad she haughtily unhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of\\nher), she would have been hurled through the air like the others, and\\nthen Hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the\\nchildren; and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered\\nSlightly’s secret, and without the secret he could not presently have\\nmade his foul attempt on Peter’s life.\\n\\nThey were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their\\nknees close to their ears; and for the trussing of them the black\\npirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well until\\nSlightly’s turn came, when he was found to be like those irritating\\nparcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags\\nwith which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked him in their rage, just as\\nyou kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kick the string);\\nand strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence.\\nHis lip was curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely\\nsweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in\\none part he bulged out in another, Hook’s master mind had gone far\\nbeneath Slightly’s surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and\\nhis exultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the\\ngills, knew that Hook had surprised his secret, which was this, that no\\nboy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick.\\nPoor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he was in a\\npanic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he had done. Madly addicted\\nto the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in consequence\\nto his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit his tree\\nhe had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit him.\\n\\nSufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay\\nat his mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the\\nsubterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed\\nthat the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be\\nalone.\\n\\nHow to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be\\nrolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a\\nmorass. Again Hook’s genius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that\\nthe little house must be used as a conveyance. The children were flung\\ninto it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others\\nfell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange\\nprocession set off through the wood. I don’t know whether any of the\\nchildren were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound; but as the\\nlittle house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of\\nsmoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook.\\n\\nHook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of\\npity for him that may have remained in the pirate’s infuriated breast.\\n\\nThe first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling\\nnight was to tiptoe to Slightly’s tree, and make sure that it provided\\nhim with a passage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill\\nomen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might\\nplay refreshingly through his hair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue\\neyes were as soft as the periwinkle. Intently he listened for any sound\\nfrom the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house\\nunder the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void.\\nWas that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly’s\\ntree, with his dagger in his hand?\\n\\nThere was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak\\nslip softly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood\\nstood on them, he stepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a\\nmoment he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like\\na candle. Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.\\n\\nHe arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again,\\nbiting at his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became\\naccustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees\\ntook shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long\\nsought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay Peter\\nfast asleep.\\n\\nUnaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a\\nlittle time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no\\ndoubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not\\ncare. Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy.\\nThen he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still\\nmore; for she had always tucked them inside it, because you never know\\nthat you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly\\ncried; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed\\ninstead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of\\nit.\\n\\nSometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful\\nthan the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from\\nthese dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I\\nthink, with the riddle of his existence. At such times it had been\\nWendy’s custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap,\\nsoothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer\\nto put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should not\\nknow of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this\\noccasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped\\nover the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part\\nof his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the\\nlittle pearls.\\n\\nThus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the\\ntree looking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of\\ncompassion disturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he\\nloved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no\\nmean performer on the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted,\\nthe idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly. Mastered by his\\nbetter self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one\\nthing.\\n\\nWhat stayed him was Peter’s impertinent appearance as he slept. The\\nopen mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a\\npersonification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one\\nmay hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness.\\nThey steeled Hook’s heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred\\npieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt\\nat the sleeper.\\n\\nThough a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in\\ndarkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered\\nan obstacle, the door of Slightly’s tree. It did not entirely fill the\\naperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he\\nfound to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his\\ndisordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter’s\\nface and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung\\nhimself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?\\n\\nBut what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter’s\\nmedicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was\\nstraightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.\\n\\nLest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a\\ndreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that\\nhad come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow\\nliquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent\\npoison in existence.\\n\\nFive drops of this he now added to Peter’s cup. His hand shook, but it\\nwas in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided\\nglancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely\\nto avoid spilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim,\\nand turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged\\nat the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole.\\nDonning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around\\nhim, holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the\\nnight, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to\\nhimself, stole away through the trees.\\n\\nPeter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement\\nin darkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten\\no’clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened\\nby he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his\\ntree.\\n\\nSoft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt\\nfor his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.\\n\\n“Who is that?”\\n\\nFor long there was no answer: then again the knock.\\n\\n“Who are you?”\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\nHe was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached\\nthe door. Unlike Slightly’s door, it filled the aperture, so that he\\ncould not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.\\n\\n“I won’t open unless you speak,” Peter cried.\\n\\nThen at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.\\n\\n“Let me in, Peter.”\\n\\nIt was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her\\nface flushed and her dress stained with mud.\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“Oh, you could never guess!” she cried, and offered him three guesses.\\n“Out with it!” he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long\\nas the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she told of the\\ncapture of Wendy and the boys.\\n\\nPeter’s heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on\\nthe pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!\\n\\n“I’ll rescue her!” he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he\\nthought of something he could do to please her. He could take his\\nmedicine.\\n\\nHis hand closed on the fatal draught.\\n\\n“No!” shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as\\nhe sped through the forest.\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“It is poisoned.”\\n\\n“Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?”\\n\\n“Hook.”\\n\\n“Don’t be silly. How could Hook have got down here?”\\n\\nAlas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the\\ndark secret of Slightly’s tree. Nevertheless Hook’s words had left no\\nroom for doubt. The cup was poisoned.\\n\\n“Besides,” said Peter, quite believing himself, “I never fell asleep.”\\n\\nHe raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one\\nof her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught,\\nand drained it to the dregs.\\n\\n“Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?”\\n\\nBut she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.\\n\\n“What is the matter with you?” cried Peter, suddenly afraid.\\n\\n“It was poisoned, Peter,” she told him softly; “and now I am going to\\nbe dead.”\\n\\n“O Tink, did you drink it to save me?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“But why, Tink?”\\n\\nHer wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on\\nhis shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear\\n“You silly ass,” and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the\\nbed.\\n\\nHis head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt\\nnear her in distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and\\nhe knew that if it went out she would be no more. She liked his tears\\nso much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it.\\n\\nHer voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said.\\nThen he made it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well\\nagain if children believed in fairies.\\n\\nPeter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was\\nnight time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the\\nNeverland, and who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys\\nand girls in their nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung\\nfrom trees.\\n\\n“Do you believe?” he cried.\\n\\nTink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.\\n\\nShe fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she\\nwasn’t sure.\\n\\n“What do you think?” she asked Peter.\\n\\n“If you believe,” he shouted to them, “clap your hands; don’t let Tink\\ndie.”\\n\\nMany clapped.\\n\\nSome didn’t.\\n\\nA few beasts hissed.\\n\\nThe clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to\\ntheir nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink\\nwas saved. First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed,\\nthen she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than\\never. She never thought of thanking those who believed, but she would\\nhave liked to get at the ones who had hissed.\\n\\n“And now to rescue Wendy!”\\n\\nThe moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree,\\nbegirt with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his\\nperilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen. He had\\nhoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted\\nshould escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low\\nwould have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing\\nbirds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.\\n\\nHe regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange\\nnames that they are very wild and difficult of approach.\\n\\nThere was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at\\nwhich happily he was an adept. But in what direction, for he could not\\nbe sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of\\nsnow had obliterated all footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the\\nisland, as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of the recent\\ncarnage. He had taught the children something of the forest lore that\\nhe had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell, and knew that\\nin their dire hour they were not likely to forget it. Slightly, if he\\nhad an opportunity, would blaze the trees, for instance, Curly would\\ndrop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important\\nplace. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he could\\nnot wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.\\n\\nThe crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound,\\nnot a movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the\\nnext tree, or stalking him from behind.\\n\\nHe swore this terrible oath: “Hook or me this time.”\\n\\nNow he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across\\na space on which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his\\ndagger at the ready. He was frightfully happy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIV.\\nTHE PIRATE SHIP\\n\\n\\nOne green light squinting over Kidd’s Creek, which is near the mouth of\\nthe pirate river, marked where the brig, the _Jolly Roger_, lay, low in\\nthe water; a rakish-looking craft foul to the hull, every beam in her\\ndetestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers. She was the\\ncannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she\\nfloated immune in the horror of her name.\\n\\nShe was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from\\nher could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none\\nagreeable save the whir of the ship’s sewing machine at which Smee sat,\\never industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic\\nSmee. I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were\\nbecause he was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had\\nto turn hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer\\nevenings he had touched the fount of Hook’s tears and made it flow. Of\\nthis, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious.\\n\\nA few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma of\\nthe night; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and\\nthe exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the\\ndeck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or\\nthat out of Hook’s reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in\\npassing.\\n\\nHook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of\\ntriumph. Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the\\nother boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. It was his\\ngrimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and\\nknowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised\\nhad he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his\\nsuccess?\\n\\nBut there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action\\nof his sombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.\\n\\nHe was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the\\nquietude of the night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This\\ninscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs.\\nThey were socially inferior to him.\\n\\nHook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at\\nthis date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the\\nlines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school;\\nand its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed\\nthey are largely concerned. Thus it was offensive to him even now to\\nboard a ship in the same dress in which he grappled her, and he still\\nadhered in his walk to the school’s distinguished slouch. But above all\\nhe retained the passion for good form.\\n\\nGood form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that\\nthis is all that really matters.\\n\\nFrom far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and\\nthrough them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when\\none cannot sleep. “Have you been good form to-day?” was their eternal\\nquestion.\\n\\n“Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,” he cried.\\n\\n“Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?” the tap-tap\\nfrom his school replied.\\n\\n“I am the only man whom Barbecue feared,” he urged, “and Flint feared\\nBarbecue.”\\n\\n“Barbecue, Flint—what house?” came the cutting retort.\\n\\nMost disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about\\ngood form?\\n\\nHis vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him\\nsharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped\\ndown his tallow countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he drew\\nhis sleeve across his face, but there was no damming that trickle.\\n\\nAh, envy not Hook.\\n\\nThere came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution. It was as if\\nPeter’s terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy desire\\nto make his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for\\nit.\\n\\n“Better for Hook,” he cried, “if he had had less ambition!” It was in\\nhis darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person.\\n\\n“No little children to love me!”\\n\\nStrange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him\\nbefore; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he\\nmuttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under\\nthe conviction that all children feared him.\\n\\nFeared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that\\nnight who did not already love him. He had said horrid things to them\\nand hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could not hit with\\nhis fist, but they had only clung to him the more. Michael had tried on\\nhis spectacles.\\n\\nTo tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it,\\nbut it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his\\nmind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the\\nsleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it that made\\nhim so? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself—“Good form?”\\n\\nHad the bo’sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of\\nall?\\n\\nHe remembered that you have to prove you don’t know you have it before\\nyou are eligible for Pop.\\n\\nWith a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee’s head; but he did\\nnot tear. What arrested him was this reflection:\\n\\n“To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?”\\n\\n“Bad form!”\\n\\nThe unhappy Hook was as impotent as he was damp, and he fell forward\\nlike a cut flower.\\n\\nHis dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly\\nrelaxed; and they broke into a bacchanalian dance, which brought him to\\nhis feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of\\nwater had passed over him.\\n\\n“Quiet, you scugs,” he cried, “or I’ll cast anchor in you;” and at once\\nthe din was hushed. “Are all the children chained, so that they cannot\\nfly away?”\\n\\n“Ay, ay.”\\n\\n“Then hoist them up.”\\n\\nThe wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy,\\nand ranged in line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious of\\ntheir presence. He lolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously,\\nsnatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon\\nthe light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face.\\n\\n“Now then, bullies,” he said briskly, “six of you walk the plank\\nto-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to\\nbe?”\\n\\n“Don’t irritate him unnecessarily,” had been Wendy’s instructions in\\nthe hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated the idea\\nof signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would be\\nprudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a\\nsomewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be\\nthe buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for\\nit, but make constant use of it.\\n\\nSo Tootles explained prudently, “You see, sir, I don’t think my mother\\nwould like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a\\npirate, Slightly?”\\n\\nHe winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, “I don’t think so,” as if\\nhe wished things had been otherwise. “Would your mother like you to be\\na pirate, Twin?”\\n\\n“I don’t think so,” said the first twin, as clever as the others.\\n“Nibs, would—”\\n\\n“Stow this gab,” roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back.\\n“You, boy,” he said, addressing John, “you look as if you had a little\\npluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?”\\n\\nNow John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and\\nhe was struck by Hook’s picking him out.\\n\\n“I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,” he said\\ndiffidently.\\n\\n“And a good name too. We’ll call you that here, bully, if you join.”\\n\\n“What do you think, Michael?” asked John.\\n\\n“What would you call me if I join?” Michael demanded.\\n\\n“Blackbeard Joe.”\\n\\nMichael was naturally impressed. “What do you think, John?” He wanted\\nJohn to decide, and John wanted him to decide.\\n\\n“Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?” John inquired.\\n\\nThrough Hook’s teeth came the answer: “You would have to swear, ‘Down\\nwith the King.’”\\n\\nPerhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.\\n\\n“Then I refuse,” he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.\\n\\n“And I refuse,” cried Michael.\\n\\n“Rule Britannia!” squeaked Curly.\\n\\nThe infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,\\n“That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.”\\n\\nThey were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco\\npreparing the fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was\\nbrought up.\\n\\nNo words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the\\nboys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all\\nthat she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was\\nnot a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written\\nwith your finger “Dirty pig”; and she had already written it on\\nseveral. But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought, of\\ncourse, save for them.\\n\\n“So, my beauty,” said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, “you are to see\\nyour children walk the plank.”\\n\\nFine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had\\nsoiled his ruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a\\nhasty gesture he tried to hide it, but he was too late.\\n\\n“Are they to die?” asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful contempt\\nthat he nearly fainted.\\n\\n“They are,” he snarled. “Silence all,” he called gloatingly, “for a\\nmother’s last words to her children.”\\n\\nAt this moment Wendy was grand. “These are my last words, dear boys,”\\nshe said firmly. “I feel that I have a message to you from your real\\nmothers, and it is this: ‘We hope our sons will die like English\\ngentlemen.’”\\n\\nEven the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, “I am\\ngoing to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?”\\n\\n“What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?”\\n\\n“What my mother hopes. John, what are—”\\n\\nBut Hook had found his voice again.\\n\\n“Tie her up!” he shouted.\\n\\nIt was Smee who tied her to the mast. “See here, honey,” he whispered,\\n“I’ll save you if you promise to be my mother.”\\n\\nBut not even for Smee would she make such a promise. “I would almost\\nrather have no children at all,” she said disdainfully.\\n\\nIt is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to\\nthe mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they\\nwere about to take. They were no longer able to hope that they would\\nwalk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they\\ncould stare and shiver only.\\n\\nHook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward\\nWendy. His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the\\nboys walking the plank one by one. But he never reached her, he never\\nheard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her. He heard something\\nelse instead.\\n\\nIt was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.\\n\\nThey all heard it—pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was\\nblown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded,\\nbut toward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him\\nalone, and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.\\n\\nVery frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as\\nif he had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.\\n\\nThe sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly\\nthought, “The crocodile is about to board the ship!”\\n\\nEven the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no\\nintrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully\\nalone, any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell:\\nbut the gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its\\nguidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound\\nas he could go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and\\nit was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.\\n\\n“Hide me!” he cried hoarsely.\\n\\nThey gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was\\ncoming aboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.\\n\\nOnly when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of\\nthe boys so that they could rush to the ship’s side to see the\\ncrocodile climbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of the\\nNight of Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid.\\nIt was Peter.\\n\\nHe signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might\\nrouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XV.\\n“HOOK OR ME THIS TIME”\\n\\n\\nOdd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our\\nnoticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance,\\nwe suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don’t\\nknow how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come\\nthat night to Peter. When last we saw him he was stealing across the\\nisland with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had\\nseen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it,\\nbut by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he\\nthought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run\\ndown.\\n\\nWithout giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a\\nfellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter\\nbegan to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use; and\\nhe decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the\\ncrocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one\\nunforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound,\\nand it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what\\nit had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again\\nticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a\\nfixed idea, it was a stupid beast.\\n\\nPeter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs\\nencountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new\\nelement. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human\\nof whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: “Hook or me this\\ntime.” He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without\\nknowing that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for\\nto board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had\\nnot occurred to him.\\n\\nOn the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a\\nmouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with\\nHook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.\\n\\nThe crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the\\nticking. At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and\\nhe looked behind him swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it\\nhimself, and in a flash he understood the situation. “How clever of\\nme!” he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into\\napplause.\\n\\nIt was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the\\nforecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by\\nyour watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the\\nill-fated pirate’s mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward.\\nFour boys caught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and\\nthe carrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence.\\nHow long has it taken?\\n\\n“One!” (Slightly had begun to count.)\\n\\nNone too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the\\ncabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look\\nround. They could hear each other’s distressed breathing now, which\\nshowed them that the more terrible sound had passed.\\n\\n“It’s gone, captain,” Smee said, wiping off his spectacles. “All’s\\nstill again.”\\n\\nSlowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently\\nthat he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound,\\nand he drew himself up firmly to his full height.\\n\\n“Then here’s to Johnny Plank!” he cried brazenly, hating the boys more\\nthan ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into the\\nvillainous ditty:\\n\\n“Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,\\n    You walks along it so,\\nTill it goes down and you goes down\\n    To Davy Jones below!”\\n\\nTo terrorise the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of\\ndignity, he danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he\\nsang; and when he finished he cried, “Do you want a touch of the cat\\nbefore you walk the plank?”\\n\\nAt that they fell on their knees. “No, no!” they cried so piteously\\nthat every pirate smiled.\\n\\n“Fetch the cat, Jukes,” said Hook; “it’s in the cabin.”\\n\\nThe cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.\\n\\n“Ay, ay,” said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They\\nfollowed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed\\nhis song, his dogs joining in with him:\\n\\n“Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,\\n    Its tails are nine, you know,\\nAnd when they’re writ upon your back—”\\n\\nWhat was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song\\nwas stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the\\nship, and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well\\nunderstood by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than\\nthe screech.\\n\\n“What was that?” cried Hook.\\n\\n“Two,” said Slightly solemnly.\\n\\nThe Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin.\\nHe tottered out, haggard.\\n\\n“What’s the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?” hissed Hook, towering\\nover him.\\n\\n“The matter wi’ him is he’s dead, stabbed,” replied Cecco in a hollow\\nvoice.\\n\\n“Bill Jukes dead!” cried the startled pirates.\\n\\n“The cabin’s as black as a pit,” Cecco said, almost gibbering, “but\\nthere is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing.”\\n\\nThe exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both\\nwere seen by Hook.\\n\\n“Cecco,” he said in his most steely voice, “go back and fetch me out\\nthat doodle-doo.”\\n\\nCecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying “No,\\nno”; but Hook was purring to his claw.\\n\\n“Did you say you would go, Cecco?” he said musingly.\\n\\nCecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more\\nsinging, all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a\\ncrow.\\n\\nNo one spoke except Slightly. “Three,” he said.\\n\\nHook rallied his dogs with a gesture. “’S’death and odds fish,” he\\nthundered, “who is to bring me that doodle-doo?”\\n\\n“Wait till Cecco comes out,” growled Starkey, and the others took up\\nthe cry.\\n\\n“I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,” said Hook, purring again.\\n\\n“No, by thunder!” Starkey cried.\\n\\n“My hook thinks you did,” said Hook, crossing to him. “I wonder if it\\nwould not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?”\\n\\n“I’ll swing before I go in there,” replied Starkey doggedly, and again\\nhe had the support of the crew.\\n\\n“Is this mutiny?” asked Hook more pleasantly than ever. “Starkey’s\\nringleader!”\\n\\n“Captain, mercy!” Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.\\n\\n“Shake hands, Starkey,” said Hook, proffering his claw.\\n\\nStarkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up\\nHook advanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing\\nscream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the\\nsea.\\n\\n“Four,” said Slightly.\\n\\n“And now,” Hook said courteously, “did any other gentlemen say mutiny?”\\nSeizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture, “I’ll\\nbring out that doodle-doo myself,” he said, and sped into the cabin.\\n\\n“Five.” How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be ready,\\nbut Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.\\n\\n“Something blew out the light,” he said a little unsteadily.\\n\\n“Something!” echoed Mullins.\\n\\n“What of Cecco?” demanded Noodler.\\n\\n“He’s as dead as Jukes,” said Hook shortly.\\n\\nHis reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably,\\nand the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are\\nsuperstitious, and Cookson cried, “They do say the surest sign a ship’s\\naccurst is when there’s one on board more than can be accounted for.”\\n\\n“I’ve heard,” muttered Mullins, “he always boards the pirate craft\\nlast. Had he a tail, captain?”\\n\\n“They say,” said another, looking viciously at Hook, “that when he\\ncomes it’s in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.”\\n\\n“Had he a hook, captain?” asked Cookson insolently; and one after\\nanother took up the cry, “The ship’s doomed!” At this the children\\ncould not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his\\nprisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.\\n\\n“Lads,” he cried to his crew, “now here’s a notion. Open the cabin door\\nand drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If\\nthey kill him, we’re so much the better; if he kills them, we’re none\\nthe worse.”\\n\\nFor the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his\\nbidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin\\nand the door was closed on them.\\n\\n“Now, listen!” cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to face\\nthe door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the\\nmast. It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it\\nwas for the reappearance of Peter.\\n\\nShe had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which\\nhe had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their\\nmanacles, and now they all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they\\ncould find. First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendy’s bonds, and\\nthen nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off\\ntogether; but one thing barred the way, an oath, “Hook or me this\\ntime.” So when he had freed Wendy, he whispered for her to conceal\\nherself with the others, and himself took her place by the mast, her\\ncloak around him so that he should pass for her. Then he took a great\\nbreath and crowed.\\n\\nTo the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the\\ncabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but\\nlike the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew\\nthat if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.\\n\\n“Lads,” he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never\\nquailing for an instant, “I’ve thought it out. There’s a Jonah aboard.”\\n\\n“Ay,” they snarled, “a man wi’ a hook.”\\n\\n“No, lads, no, it’s the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi’ a\\nwoman on board. We’ll right the ship when she’s gone.”\\n\\nSome of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint’s. “It’s\\nworth trying,” they said doubtfully.\\n\\n“Fling the girl overboard,” cried Hook; and they made a rush at the\\nfigure in the cloak.\\n\\n“There’s none can save you now, missy,” Mullins hissed jeeringly.\\n\\n“There’s one,” replied the figure.\\n\\n“Who’s that?”\\n\\n“Peter Pan the avenger!” came the terrible answer; and as he spoke\\nPeter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who ’twas that had been\\nundoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he\\nfailed. In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.\\n\\nAt last he cried, “Cleave him to the brisket!” but without conviction.\\n\\n“Down, boys, and at them!” Peter’s voice rang out; and in another\\nmoment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the\\npirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the\\nonset came when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and\\nthither, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of\\nthe crew. Man to man they were the stronger; but they fought on the\\ndefensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose\\ntheir quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in\\ndark recesses, where they were found by Slightly, who did not fight,\\nbut ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces, so that\\nthey were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords\\nof the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang of\\nweapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously\\ncounting—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten—eleven.\\n\\nI think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who\\nseemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of\\nfire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a\\nmatch for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and\\nagain he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook,\\nand was using him as a buckler, when another, who had just passed his\\nsword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.\\n\\n“Put up your swords, boys,” cried the newcomer, “this man is mine.”\\n\\nThus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others\\ndrew back and formed a ring around them.\\n\\nFor long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering\\nslightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.\\n\\n“So, Pan,” said Hook at last, “this is all your doing.”\\n\\n“Ay, James Hook,” came the stern answer, “it is all my doing.”\\n\\n“Proud and insolent youth,” said Hook, “prepare to meet thy doom.”\\n\\n“Dark and sinister man,” Peter answered, “have at thee.”\\n\\nWithout more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage\\nto either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with\\ndazzling rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge\\nthat got past his foe’s defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill\\nstead, and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his\\ninferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced\\nhim back by the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a\\nfavourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his\\nastonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he\\nsought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this\\ntime had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging\\nfiercely, pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose\\npeculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell\\nfrom Hook’s hand, and he was at Peter’s mercy.\\n\\n“Now!” cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited\\nhis opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a\\ntragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.\\n\\nHitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker\\nsuspicions assailed him now.\\n\\n“Pan, who and what art thou?” he cried huskily.\\n\\n“I’m youth, I’m joy,” Peter answered at a venture, “I’m a little bird\\nthat has broken out of the egg.”\\n\\nThis, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook\\nthat Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the\\nvery pinnacle of good form.\\n\\n“To’t again,” he cried despairingly.\\n\\nHe fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible\\nsword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but\\nPeter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of\\nthe danger zone. And again and again he darted in and pricked.\\n\\nHook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer\\nasked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form\\nbefore it was cold forever.\\n\\nAbandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.\\n\\n“In two minutes,” he cried, “the ship will be blown to pieces.”\\n\\nNow, now, he thought, true form will show.\\n\\nBut Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands,\\nand calmly flung it overboard.\\n\\nWhat sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he\\nwas, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he\\nwas true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were flying\\naround him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck\\nstriking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it\\nwas slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up for\\ngood, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes were\\nright, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his\\nsocks were right.\\n\\nJames Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.\\n\\nFor we have come to his last moment.\\n\\nSeeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger\\npoised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He\\ndid not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely\\nstopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little\\nmark of respect from us at the end.\\n\\nHe had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he\\nstood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through\\nthe air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter\\nkick instead of stab.\\n\\nAt last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.\\n\\n“Bad form,” he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.\\n\\nThus perished James Hook.\\n\\n“Seventeen,” Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his\\nfigures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two\\nreached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him\\nnurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and\\nSmee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making\\na precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had\\nfeared.\\n\\nWendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though\\nwatching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she\\nbecame prominent again. She praised them equally, and shuddered\\ndelightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one;\\nand then she took them into Hook’s cabin and pointed to his watch which\\nwas hanging on a nail. It said “half-past one!”\\n\\nThe lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got\\nthem to bed in the pirates’ bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all\\nbut Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell\\nasleep by the side of Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night,\\nand cried in his sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him tightly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVI.\\nTHE RETURN HOME\\n\\n\\nBy three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps; for\\nthere was a big sea running; and Tootles, the bo’sun, was among them,\\nwith a rope’s end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned\\npirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up,\\nwith the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers.\\n\\nIt need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and\\nsecond mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars before the\\nmast, and lived in the fo’c’sle. Peter had already lashed himself to\\nthe wheel; but he piped all hands and delivered a short address to\\nthem; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties, but\\nthat he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they\\nsnapped at him he would tear them. The bluff strident words struck the\\nnote sailors understood, and they cheered him lustily. Then a few sharp\\norders were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed her for\\nthe mainland.\\n\\nCaptain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship’s chart, that if this\\nweather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June,\\nafter which it would save time to fly.\\n\\nSome of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour\\nof keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they\\ndared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin. Instant\\nobedience was the only safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking\\nperplexed when told to take soundings. The general feeling was that\\nPeter was honest just now to lull Wendy’s suspicions, but that there\\nmight be a change when the new suit was ready, which, against her will,\\nshe was making for him out of some of Hook’s wickedest garments. It was\\nafterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this\\nsuit he sat long in the cabin with Hook’s cigar-holder in his mouth and\\none hand clenched, all but for the forefinger, which he bent and held\\nthreateningly aloft like a hook.\\n\\nInstead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that\\ndesolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless\\nflight so long ago. It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this\\ntime; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we\\nhad returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, she would\\nprobably have cried, “Don’t be silly; what do I matter? Do go back and\\nkeep an eye on the children.” So long as mothers are like this their\\nchildren will take advantage of them; and they may lay to that.\\n\\nEven now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful\\noccupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance\\nof them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs.\\nDarling do not go out for the evening. We are no more than servants.\\nWhy on earth should their beds be properly aired, seeing that they left\\nthem in such a thankless hurry? Would it not serve them jolly well\\nright if they came back and found that their parents were spending the\\nweek-end in the country? It would be the moral lesson they have been in\\nneed of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in this way\\nMrs. Darling would never forgive us.\\n\\nOne thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in\\nthe way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed\\nthey will be here on Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the\\nsurprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward. They\\nhave been planning it out on the ship: mother’s rapture, father’s shout\\nof joy, Nana’s leap through the air to embrace them first, when what\\nthey ought to be prepared for is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil\\nit all by breaking the news in advance; so that when they enter grandly\\nMrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr. Darling may\\nexclaim pettishly, “Dash it all, here are those boys again.” However,\\nwe should get no thanks even for this. We are beginning to know Mrs.\\nDarling by this time, and may be sure that she would upbraid us for\\ndepriving the children of their little pleasure.\\n\\n“But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by\\ntelling you what’s what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.”\\n\\n“Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of\\ndelight.”\\n\\n“Oh, if you look at it in that way!”\\n\\n“What other way is there in which to look at it?”\\n\\nYou see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say\\nextraordinarily nice things about her; but I despise her, and not one\\nof them will I say now. She does not really need to be told to have\\nthings ready, for they are ready. All the beds are aired, and she never\\nleaves the house, and observe, the window is open. For all the use we\\nare to her, we might well go back to the ship. However, as we are here\\nwe may as well stay and look on. That is all we are, lookers-on. Nobody\\nreally wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that\\nsome of them will hurt.\\n\\nThe only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine\\nand six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr.\\nDarling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained\\nNana up, and that from first to last she had been wiser than he. Of\\ncourse, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed he might\\nhave passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness\\noff; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion’s courage to\\ndo what seemed right to him; and having thought the matter out with\\nanxious care after the flight of the children, he went down on all\\nfours and crawled into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling’s dear\\ninvitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly:\\n\\n“No, my own one, this is the place for me.”\\n\\nIn the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the\\nkennel until his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but\\nwhatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave\\nup doing it. And there never was a more humble man than the once proud\\nGeorge Darling, as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his\\nwife of their children and all their pretty ways.\\n\\nVery touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into\\nthe kennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly.\\n\\nEvery morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab,\\nwhich conveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way\\nat six. Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen\\nif we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this\\nman whose every movement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he\\nmust have suffered torture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when\\nthe young criticised his little home, and he always lifted his hat\\ncourteously to any lady who looked inside.\\n\\nIt may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward\\nmeaning of it leaked out, and the great heart of the public was\\ntouched. Crowds followed the cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls\\nscaled it to get his autograph; interviews appeared in the better class\\nof papers, and society invited him to dinner and added, “Do come in the\\nkennel.”\\n\\nOn that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery\\nawaiting George’s return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look\\nat her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone\\nnow just because she has lost her babes, I find I won’t be able to say\\nnasty things about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy\\nchildren, she couldn’t help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has\\nfallen asleep. The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is\\nalmost withered up. Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she\\nhad a pain there. Some like Peter best, and some like Wendy best, but I\\nlike her best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her\\nsleep that the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles\\nof the window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that\\nthey are on the way. Let’s.\\n\\nIt is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names;\\nand there is no one in the room but Nana.\\n\\n“O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.”\\n\\nNana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on her\\nmistress’s lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was\\nbrought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see\\nthat his face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.\\n\\nHe gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no\\nimagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of\\nsuch a man. Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were\\nstill cheering, and he was naturally not unmoved.\\n\\n“Listen to them,” he said; “it is very gratifying.”\\n\\n“Lots of little boys,” sneered Liza.\\n\\n“There were several adults to-day,” he assured her with a faint flush;\\nbut when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.\\nSocial success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some\\ntime he sat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling\\nof this success, and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she\\nhoped his head would not be turned by it.\\n\\n“But if I had been a weak man,” he said. “Good heavens, if I had been a\\nweak man!”\\n\\n“And, George,” she said timidly, “you are as full of remorse as ever,\\naren’t you?”\\n\\n“Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a\\nkennel.”\\n\\n“But it is punishment, isn’t it, George? You are sure you are not\\nenjoying it?”\\n\\n“My love!”\\n\\nYou may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he\\ncurled round in the kennel.\\n\\n“Won’t you play me to sleep,” he asked, “on the nursery piano?” and as\\nshe was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly, “And shut\\nthat window. I feel a draught.”\\n\\n“O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open\\nfor them, always, always.”\\n\\nNow it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the\\nday-nursery and played, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept,\\nWendy and John and Michael flew into the room.\\n\\nOh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement\\nplanned by them before we left the ship; but something must have\\nhappened since then, for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter\\nand Tinker Bell.\\n\\nPeter’s first words tell all.\\n\\n“Quick Tink,” he whispered, “close the window; bar it! That’s right.\\nNow you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will\\nthink her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with\\nme.”\\n\\nNow I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had\\nexterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink\\nto escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head\\nall the time.\\n\\nInstead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then\\nhe peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to\\nTink, “It’s Wendy’s mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as\\nmy mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my\\nmother’s was.”\\n\\nOf course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes\\nbragged about her.\\n\\nHe did not know the tune, which was “Home, Sweet Home,” but he knew it\\nwas saying, “Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy”; and he cried exultantly,\\n“You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred!”\\n\\nHe peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw\\nthat Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were\\nsitting on her eyes.\\n\\n“She wants me to unbar the window,” thought Peter, “but I won’t, not\\nI!”\\n\\nHe peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had\\ntaken their place.\\n\\n“She’s awfully fond of Wendy,” he said to himself. He was angry with\\nher now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.\\n\\nThe reason was so simple: “I’m fond of her too. We can’t both have her,\\nlady.”\\n\\nBut the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He\\nceased to look at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He\\nskipped about and made funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as\\nif she were inside him, knocking.\\n\\n“Oh, all right,” he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred the\\nwindow. “Come on, Tink,” he cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws\\nof nature; “we don’t want any silly mothers;” and he flew away.\\n\\nThus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after\\nall, which of course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the\\nfloor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already\\nforgotten his home.\\n\\n“John,” he said, looking around him doubtfully, “I think I have been\\nhere before.”\\n\\n“Of course you have, you silly. There is your old bed.”\\n\\n“So it is,” Michael said, but not with much conviction.\\n\\n“I say,” cried John, “the kennel!” and he dashed across to look into\\nit.\\n\\n“Perhaps Nana is inside it,” Wendy said.\\n\\nBut John whistled. “Hullo,” he said, “there’s a man inside it.”\\n\\n“It’s father!” exclaimed Wendy.\\n\\n“Let me see father,” Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good look.\\n“He is not so big as the pirate I killed,” he said with such frank\\ndisappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have\\nbeen sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael\\nsay.\\n\\nWendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in\\nthe kennel.\\n\\n“Surely,” said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory, “he\\nused not to sleep in the kennel?”\\n\\n“John,” Wendy said falteringly, “perhaps we don’t remember the old life\\nas well as we thought we did.”\\n\\nA chill fell upon them; and serve them right.\\n\\n“It is very careless of mother,” said that young scoundrel John, “not\\nto be here when we come back.”\\n\\nIt was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.\\n\\n“It’s mother!” cried Wendy, peeping.\\n\\n“So it is!” said John.\\n\\n“Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?” asked Michael, who was\\nsurely sleepy.\\n\\n“Oh dear!” exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse, “it\\nwas quite time we came back.”\\n\\n“Let us creep in,” John suggested, “and put our hands over her eyes.”\\n\\nBut Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently,\\nhad a better plan.\\n\\n“Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as\\nif we had never been away.”\\n\\nAnd so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her\\nhusband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited for\\nher cry of joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not\\nbelieve they were there. You see, she saw them in their beds so often\\nin her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around\\nher still.\\n\\nShe sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had\\nnursed them.\\n\\nThey could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three\\nof them.\\n\\n“Mother!” Wendy cried.\\n\\n“That’s Wendy,” she said, but still she was sure it was the dream.\\n\\n“Mother!”\\n\\n“That’s John,” she said.\\n\\n“Mother!” cried Michael. He knew her now.\\n\\n“That’s Michael,” she said, and she stretched out her arms for the\\nthree little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, they\\ndid, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of\\nbed and run to her.\\n\\n“George, George!” she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling woke\\nto share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been\\na lovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who\\nwas staring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that\\nother children can never know; but he was looking through the window at\\nthe one joy from which he must be for ever barred.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVII.\\nWHEN WENDY GREW UP\\n\\n\\nI hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were\\nwaiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they\\nhad counted five hundred they went up. They went up by the stair,\\nbecause they thought this would make a better impression. They stood in\\na row in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they\\nwere not wearing their pirate clothes. They said nothing, but their\\neyes asked her to have them. They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling\\nalso, but they forgot about him.\\n\\nOf course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr.\\nDarling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a\\nrather large number.\\n\\n“I must say,” he said to Wendy, “that you don’t do things by halves,” a\\ngrudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them.\\n\\nThe first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, “Do you think\\nwe should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go\\naway.”\\n\\n“Father!” Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. He knew\\nhe was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.\\n\\n“We could lie doubled up,” said Nibs.\\n\\n“I always cut their hair myself,” said Wendy.\\n\\n“George!” Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one showing\\nhimself in such an unfavourable light.\\n\\nThen he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to\\nhave them as she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked\\nhis consent as well as hers, instead of treating him as a cypher in his\\nown house.\\n\\n“I don’t think he is a cypher,” Tootles cried instantly. “Do you think\\nhe is a cypher, Curly?”\\n\\n“No, I don’t. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?”\\n\\n“Rather not. Twin, what do you think?”\\n\\nIt turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was\\nabsurdly gratified, and said he would find space for them all in the\\ndrawing-room if they fitted in.\\n\\n“We’ll fit in, sir,” they assured him.\\n\\n“Then follow the leader,” he cried gaily. “Mind you, I am not sure that\\nwe have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it’s all the same.\\nHoop la!”\\n\\nHe went off dancing through the house, and they all cried “Hoop la!”\\nand danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget\\nwhether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all\\nfitted in.\\n\\nAs for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not\\nexactly come to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so\\nthat she could open it if she liked and call to him. That is what she\\ndid.\\n\\n“Hullo, Wendy, good-bye,” he said.\\n\\n“Oh dear, are you going away?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“You don’t feel, Peter,” she said falteringly, “that you would like to\\nsay anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“About me, Peter?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\nMrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp\\neye on Wendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys,\\nand would like to adopt him also.\\n\\n“Would you send me to school?” he inquired craftily.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And then to an office?”\\n\\n“I suppose so.”\\n\\n“Soon I would be a man?”\\n\\n“Very soon.”\\n\\n“I don’t want to go to school and learn solemn things,” he told her\\npassionately. “I don’t want to be a man. O Wendy’s mother, if I was to\\nwake up and feel there was a beard!”\\n\\n“Peter,” said Wendy the comforter, “I should love you in a beard;” and\\nMrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.\\n\\n“Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.”\\n\\n“But where are you going to live?”\\n\\n“With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it\\nhigh up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.”\\n\\n“How lovely,” cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her\\ngrip.\\n\\n“I thought all the fairies were dead,” Mrs. Darling said.\\n\\n“There are always a lot of young ones,” explained Wendy, who was now\\nquite an authority, “because you see when a new baby laughs for the\\nfirst time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies\\nthere are always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees;\\nand the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue\\nones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are.”\\n\\n“I shall have such fun,” said Peter, with eye on Wendy.\\n\\n“It will be rather lonely in the evening,” she said, “sitting by the\\nfire.”\\n\\n“I shall have Tink.”\\n\\n“Tink can’t go a twentieth part of the way round,” she reminded him a\\nlittle tartly.\\n\\n“Sneaky tell-tale!” Tink called out from somewhere round the corner.\\n\\n“It doesn’t matter,” Peter said.\\n\\n“O Peter, you know it matters.”\\n\\n“Well, then, come with me to the little house.”\\n\\n“May I, mummy?”\\n\\n“Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.”\\n\\n“But he does so need a mother.”\\n\\n“So do you, my love.”\\n\\n“Oh, all right,” Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness\\nmerely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this\\nhandsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his\\nspring cleaning. Wendy would have preferred a more permanent\\narrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming;\\nbut this promise sent Peter away quite gay again. He had no sense of\\ntime, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him\\nis only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because Wendy knew\\nthis that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:\\n\\n“You won’t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time\\ncomes?”\\n\\nOf course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling’s\\nkiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite\\neasily. Funny. But she seemed satisfied.\\n\\nOf course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class\\nIII, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V.\\nClass I is the top class. Before they had attended school a week they\\nsaw what goats they had been not to remain on the island; but it was\\ntoo late now, and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or\\nme or Jenkins minor. It is sad to have to say that the power to fly\\ngradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so\\nthat they should not fly away in the night; and one of their diversions\\nby day was to pretend to fall off buses; but by and by they ceased to\\ntug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when\\nthey let go of the bus. In time they could not even fly after their\\nhats. Want of practice, they called it; but what it really meant was\\nthat they no longer believed.\\n\\nMichael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him;\\nso he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first\\nyear. She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves\\nand berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice\\nhow short it had become; but he never noticed, he had so much to say\\nabout himself.\\n\\nShe had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but\\nnew adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.\\n\\n“Who is Captain Hook?” he asked with interest when she spoke of the\\narch enemy.\\n\\n“Don’t you remember,” she asked, amazed, “how you killed him and saved\\nall our lives?”\\n\\n“I forget them after I kill them,” he replied carelessly.\\n\\nWhen she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to\\nsee her he said, “Who is Tinker Bell?”\\n\\n“O Peter,” she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could not\\nremember.\\n\\n“There are such a lot of them,” he said. “I expect she is no more.”\\n\\nI expect he was right, for fairies don’t live long, but they are so\\nlittle that a short time seems a good while to them.\\n\\nWendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to\\nPeter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was\\nexactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning\\nin the little house on the tree tops.\\n\\nNext year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because\\nthe old one simply would not meet; but he never came.\\n\\n“Perhaps he is ill,” Michael said.\\n\\n“You know he is never ill.”\\n\\nMichael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, “Perhaps there\\nis no such person, Wendy!” and then Wendy would have cried if Michael\\nhad not been crying.\\n\\nPeter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he\\nnever knew he had missed a year.\\n\\nThat was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer\\nshe tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was\\nuntrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years\\ncame and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met\\nagain Wendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her than a\\nlittle dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown\\nup. You need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes\\nto grow up. In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker\\nthan other girls.\\n\\nAll the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely\\nworth while saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and\\nNibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag\\nand an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver. Slightly married a lady\\nof title, and so he became a lord. You see that judge in a wig coming\\nout at the iron door? That used to be Tootles. The bearded man who\\ndoesn’t know any story to tell his children was once John.\\n\\nWendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think\\nthat Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns.\\n\\nYears rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be\\nwritten in ink but in a golden splash.\\n\\nShe was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from\\nthe moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions.\\nWhen she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan.\\nShe loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember\\nin the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It\\nwas Jane’s nursery now, for her father had bought it at the three per\\ncents from Wendy’s father, who was no longer fond of stairs. Mrs.\\nDarling was now dead and forgotten.\\n\\nThere were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane’s and her nurse’s;\\nand there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died of old\\nage, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being\\nvery firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children\\nexcept herself.\\n\\nOnce a week Jane’s nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy’s\\npart to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was Jane’s\\ninvention to raise the sheet over her mother’s head and her own, thus\\nmaking a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:\\n\\n“What do we see now?”\\n\\n“I don’t think I see anything to-night,” says Wendy, with a feeling\\nthat if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.\\n\\n“Yes, you do,” says Jane, “you see when you were a little girl.”\\n\\n“That is a long time ago, sweetheart,” says Wendy. “Ah me, how time\\nflies!”\\n\\n“Does it fly,” asks the artful child, “the way you flew when you were a\\nlittle girl?”\\n\\n“The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever\\ndid really fly.”\\n\\n“Yes, you did.”\\n\\n“The dear old days when I could fly!”\\n\\n“Why can’t you fly now, mother?”\\n\\n“Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the\\nway.”\\n\\n“Why do they forget the way?”\\n\\n“Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only\\nthe gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.”\\n\\n“What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and\\ninnocent and heartless.”\\n\\nOr perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.\\n\\n“I do believe,” she says, “that it is this nursery.”\\n\\n“I do believe it is,” says Jane. “Go on.”\\n\\nThey are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter\\nflew in looking for his shadow.\\n\\n“The foolish fellow,” says Wendy, “tried to stick it on with soap, and\\nwhen he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for\\nhim.”\\n\\n“You have missed a bit,” interrupts Jane, who now knows the story\\nbetter than her mother. “When you saw him sitting on the floor crying,\\nwhat did you say?”\\n\\n“I sat up in bed and I said, ‘Boy, why are you crying?’”\\n\\n“Yes, that was it,” says Jane, with a big breath.\\n\\n“And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the\\npirates and the redskins and the mermaids’ lagoon, and the home under\\nthe ground, and the little house.”\\n\\n“Yes! which did you like best of all?”\\n\\n“I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.”\\n\\n“Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?”\\n\\n“The last thing he ever said to me was, ‘Just always be waiting for me,\\nand then some night you will hear me crowing.’”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“But, alas, he forgot all about me,” Wendy said it with a smile. She\\nwas as grown up as that.\\n\\n“What did his crow sound like?” Jane asked one evening.\\n\\n“It was like this,” Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter’s crow.\\n\\n“No, it wasn’t,” Jane said gravely, “it was like this;” and she did it\\never so much better than her mother.\\n\\nWendy was a little startled. “My darling, how can you know?”\\n\\n“I often hear it when I am sleeping,” Jane said.\\n\\n“Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only\\none who heard it awake.”\\n\\n“Lucky you,” said Jane.\\n\\nAnd then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and\\nthe story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her\\nbed. Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to\\nsee to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she\\nsat darning she heard a crow. Then the window blew open as of old, and\\nPeter dropped in on the floor.\\n\\nHe was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still\\nhad all his first teeth.\\n\\nHe was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not\\ndaring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.\\n\\n“Hullo, Wendy,” he said, not noticing any difference, for he was\\nthinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might\\nhave been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.\\n\\n“Hullo, Peter,” she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as\\npossible. Something inside her was crying “Woman, Woman, let go of me.”\\n\\n“Hullo, where is John?” he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.\\n\\n“John is not here now,” she gasped.\\n\\n“Is Michael asleep?” he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.\\n\\n“Yes,” she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as\\nwell as to Peter.\\n\\n“That is not Michael,” she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on\\nher.\\n\\nPeter looked. “Hullo, is it a new one?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Boy or girl?”\\n\\n“Girl.”\\n\\nNow surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.\\n\\n“Peter,” she said, faltering, “are you expecting me to fly away with\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Of course; that is why I have come.” He added a little sternly, “Have\\nyou forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?”\\n\\nShe knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning\\ntimes pass.\\n\\n“I can’t come,” she said apologetically, “I have forgotten how to fly.”\\n\\n“I’ll soon teach you again.”\\n\\n“O Peter, don’t waste the fairy dust on me.”\\n\\nShe had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. “What is it?” he\\ncried, shrinking.\\n\\n“I will turn up the light,” she said, “and then you can see for\\nyourself.”\\n\\nFor almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.\\n“Don’t turn up the light,” he cried.\\n\\nShe let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a\\nlittle girl heart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it\\nall, but they were wet-eyed smiles.\\n\\nThen she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and\\nwhen the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he\\ndrew back sharply.\\n\\n“What is it?” he cried again.\\n\\nShe had to tell him.\\n\\n“I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long\\nago.”\\n\\n“You promised not to!”\\n\\n“I couldn’t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.”\\n\\n“No, you’re not.”\\n\\n“Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.”\\n\\n“No, she’s not.”\\n\\nBut he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child\\nwith his dagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on\\nthe floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort\\nhim, though she could have done it so easily once. She was only a woman\\nnow, and she ran out of the room to try to think.\\n\\nPeter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed,\\nand was interested at once.\\n\\n“Boy,” she said, “why are you crying?”\\n\\nPeter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.\\n\\n“Hullo,” he said.\\n\\n“Hullo,” said Jane.\\n\\n“My name is Peter Pan,” he told her.\\n\\n“Yes, I know.”\\n\\n“I came back for my mother,” he explained, “to take her to the\\nNeverland.”\\n\\n“Yes, I know,” Jane said, “I have been waiting for you.”\\n\\nWhen Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post\\ncrowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room\\nin solemn ecstasy.\\n\\n“She is my mother,” Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood by\\nhis side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when\\nthey gazed at him.\\n\\n“He does so need a mother,” Jane said.\\n\\n“Yes, I know,” Wendy admitted rather forlornly; “no one knows it so\\nwell as I.”\\n\\n“Good-bye,” said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the\\nshameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving\\nabout.\\n\\nWendy rushed to the window.\\n\\n“No, no,” she cried.\\n\\n“It is just for spring cleaning time,” Jane said, “he wants me always\\nto do his spring cleaning.”\\n\\n“If only I could go with you,” Wendy sighed.\\n\\n“You see you can’t fly,” said Jane.\\n\\nOf course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse\\nof her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky\\nuntil they were as small as stars.\\n\\nAs you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her\\nfigure little again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a\\ncommon grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring\\ncleaning time, except when he forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and\\ntakes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself,\\nto which he listens eagerly. When Margaret grows up she will have a\\ndaughter, who is to be Peter’s mother in turn; and thus it will go on,\\nso long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.\\n\\nTHE END\\n NARRATOR:     Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a\\n              shining castle.  Although he had everything his heart desired,\\n              the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.  But then, one\\n              winter\\'s night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and\\n              offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter\\n              cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at\\n              the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not\\n              to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within.  \\n              And when he dismissed her again, the old woman\\'s ugliness\\n              melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress.  The prince\\n              tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that\\n              there was no love in his heart, and as punishment, she\\n              transformed him into a hideous beast, and placed a\\n              powerful spell on the castle, and all who lived there.\\n              Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself\\n              inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to\\n              the outside world.  The rose she had offered was truly an\\n              enchanted rose, which would bloom until his twenty-first\\n              year.  If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in\\n              return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would\\n              be broken.  If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for\\n              all time.  As the years passed, he fell into despair, and lost\\n              all hope, for who could ever learn to love a beast?\\n\\n(We have seen a progression of stained glass windows illustrating the \\nnarration, as well as BEAST shredding his portrait.

MAURICE runs away, being\\n              chased by the WOLVES.  He stumbles down a hill, and lands at the\\n              gate of a castle. He grabs the locked gate and tries to shake it\\n              open.)\\nMAURICE:      Help!  Is someone there?\\n(The gate opens, and MAURICE runs in. He slams the gate in the faces of the\\nWOLVES.

Hello?\\n(Watching from a table near the entrance are LUMIERE and COGSWORTH)\\nLUMIERE:      (Barely whispering) Old fellow must have lost his way in the\\nwoods.\\nCOGSWORTH:    (Also whispering) Keep quiet!

MAURICE looks at\\nLUMIERE.)\\n              Allo!\\nMAURICE:      Oh!!!! (Startled, he drops LUMIERE onto the floor.)  Incredible!\\nCOGSWORTH:    (hopping over)  Well, now you\\'ve done it, Lumiere. Splendid,\\n              just peachy--aaarrrgghh!  (MAURICE picks up COGSWORTH)\\nMAURICE:      How is this accomplished? (He fiddles with COGSWORTH)\\nCOGSWORTH:    Put me down! At once!  (MAURICE tickles the bottoms of\\n              COGSWORTH\\'s feet. He laughs.  He begins to wind the spring on\\n              the back of COGSWORTH\\'s head, twisting his face around with the\\n              clock hands. MAURICE opens the front of COGSWORTH and begins\\n              to play with his pendulum. COGSWORTH slams the door shut on\\n              his finger.) Sir, close that at once, do you mind!\\nMAURICE:      I beg your pardon, it\\'s just that I\\'ve never seen a clock\\n              that...aah...i mean...aah aah aah-chooo!!!!

Come, warm yourself by\\n              the fire.\\nMAURICE:      Thank you.\\n(LUMIERE and MAURICE head towards the den, with COGSWORTH running after them.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    No, no, no, do you know what the master would do if he finds you\\n              here. (BEAST is watching the action from an overhead walkway,\\n              and rushes off as the trio enters the den.)  I demand that you\\n              stop...right...there! (COGSWORTH tumbles down the steps. MAURICE\\n              takes a seat in a large chair in front of a roaring fire.)  Oh\\n              no, not the master\\'s chair!

I\\'m in charge here, and\\n              (COGSWORTH  is run over by the (once again) anachronistic\\n              IndyCar sounding teacart of MRS. POTTS)\\nMRS.

Hello!\\n(The door to the den slams open and a strong gust of wind blows into the room,\\nextinguishing LUMIERE\\'s flames and the fire in the fireplace.  COGSWORTH dives\\nfor cover.  MRS. POTTS begins to shake.  CHIP jumps back onto the tea cart and\\ntakes refuge from behind his mother)\\nCHIP:         Uh oh!\\n(BEAST enters.  We see him in full for the first time.

The\\n              gentleman was lost in the woods and he was cold and wet...\\n              (LUMIERE\\'s last sentence is drowned out by the very loud growl\\n              of BEAST, which puts out his flames once again.  LUMIERE looks\\n              down, dejected.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    (Coming out from under a rug) Master, I\\'d like to take this\\n              moment to say...I was against this from the start.

I just needed a place to stay .\\nBEAST:        I\\'ll give you a place to stay!  (BEAST picks up MAURICE, carries\\n              him out of the room and slams the door, plunging the den, along\\n              with COGSWORTH, LUMIERE,MRS.

This is her lucky day!\\n(GASTON lets go of a branch, which swings back and hits LEFOU in the mouth.\\nGASTON turns to the band, wedding guests and others, apparently just out of\\nsight of BELLE\\'s cottage.)\\nGASTON:       I\\'d like to thank you all for coming to my wedding.  But first, I\\n              better go in there and... propose to the girl!  (MINISTER, BAKER,\\n              and OTHERS laugh heartily.

BELLE is sitting in a chair reading her new book.\\nThere is a knock at the door.  She puts the book down and walks to the door.\\nShe reaches up and pulls down a viewing device.  She peeks through and sees an\\nanachronistically accurate fish-eye view of GASTON.  She moans, and pushes the\\ndoor open.)\\nBELLE:        Gaston, what a pleasant...surprise.\\nGASTON:       Isn\\'t it though? I\\'m just full of surprises.  You know, Belle.\\n              There\\'s not a girl in town who wouldn\\'t love to be in your shoes.\\n              This is the day...(GASTON pauses by a mirror and licks his teeth\\n              clean.) This is the day your dreams come true.\\nBELLE:        What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?\\nGASTON:       Plenty.  Here, picture this.  (GASTON plops down in the chair and\\n              props his mud-covered feet up on BELLE\\'s book. He begins to kick\\n              off his boots and wiggle his toes through his hole-y socks.)  A\\n              rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting on the fire, and my\\n              little wife, massaging my feet, while the little ones play with\\n              the dogs.  (BELLE looks positively disgusted.  GASTON gets up\\n              next to her face.)  We\\'ll have six or seven.\\nBELLE:        Dogs?\\nGASTON:       No, Belle!  Strapping boys, like me!\\nBELLE:        Imagine that.

(She twists the knob and the door opens (this\\n              time outward).

He tilts his head, and the pig\\nslides\\ndown his back.)\\nLEFOU:        So, how\\'d it go?\\nGASTON:       (Picks up LEFOU by the neck) I\\'ll have Belle for my wife, make no\\n              mistake about that! (GASTON drops LEFOU into the mud.)\\nLEFOU:        (To PIERRE) Touchy!\\nPIERRE:       Grunt Grunt.\\n(GASTON walks off, dejected, and the focus returns to the cottage. BELLE pokes\\nher head out the door.)\\nBELLE:        (To the chickens) Is he gone? Can you imagine, he asked me to\\n              marry him.  Me, the wife of that\\n              boorish, brainless...\\n              Madame Gaston, can\\'t you just see it\\n              Madame Gaston, his little wife\\n              Not me, no sir, I guarantee it\\n              I want much more than this provincial life...\\n(BELLE walks into the pen and feeds the animals, then runs off singing into an\\nopen field overlooking a beautiful valley)\\n              I want adventure in the great wide somewhere\\n              I want it more than I can tell\\n              And for once it might be grand\\n              To have someone understand\\n              I want so much more than they\\'ve got planned\\n(PHILLIPE runs into the open field.

Oh, we have to find him, you have to\\n              take me to him!\\n(BELLE unhitches the wagon from PHILLIPE.  Cut to exterior of the castle gate.\\n(How PHILLIPE brought BELLE there is a mystery, seeing as PHILLIPE never made\\nit\\nto the castle with MAURICE.))\\nBELLE:        What is this place?\\n(PHILLIPE snorts, then begins to buck as if something is scaring him.  BELLE\\ndismounts and comforts him.)\\nBELLE:        Phillipe, please, steady.  (She enters the gate and sees\\nMAURICE\\'s\\n              hat on the ground.) Papa.\\n(Cut to interior of castle with COGSWORTH and LUMIERE discussing events.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    Couldn\\'t keep quiet, could we.  Just had to invite him to stay,\\n              didn\\'t we?  Serve him tea, sit in the master\\'s chair, pet the\\n              pooch.\\nLUMIERE:      I was trying to be hospitable.\\n(Cut back to door opening and BELLE entering castle.)\\nBELLE:        Hello?  Is anyone here?  Hello? Papa?  Papa, are you here?\\n(We follow as BELLE ascends the grand staircase and searches for her father.\\nCut\\nto kitchen where MRS. POTTS is standing next to a tub of hot water. CHIP hops\\nin.)\\nCHIP:         Momma.  There\\'s a girl in the castle!\\nMRS. POTTS:   Now, Chip, I won\\'t have you making up such wild stories.\\nCHIP:         But really, momma, I saw her.\\nMRS. POTTS:   (Disgusted) Not another word.  Into the tub. (She lifts CHIP\\n              into the tub.  FEATHERDUSTER  enters)\\nFEATHERDUSTER:\\n              A girl!  I saw a girl in the castle!\\nCHIP:         (poking his head out from the water) See, I told ya!\\n(Cut back to LUMIERE and COGSWORTH bickering)\\nCOGSWORTH:    Irresponsible, devil-may-care, waxy eared, slack-jawed--\\nBELLE:        Papa?\\n(COGSWORTH and LUMIERE turn to look at the new arrival)\\nLUMIERE:      Did you see that? (Running to the door and poking his head around\\n              the corner with COGSWORTH)  It\\'s a girl!\\nCOGSWORTH:    I know it\\'s a girl.\\nLUMIERE:      Don\\'t you see?  She\\'s the one. The girl we have been waiting for.\\n              She has come to break the spell! (He chases after her.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    Wait a minute, wait a minute!\\n(BELLE advances down a narrow hallway.  COGSWORTH and LUMIERE sneak up behind\\nher and open the door that leads to the tower where MAURICE is being kept. The\\ndoor creaks open and BELLE hears the sound)\\nBELLE:        Papa?  Papa? (COGSWORTH hides behind the door and LUMIERE rushes\\n              off.) Hello? Is someone here?  Wait!  I\\'m looking for my father!\\n              (She begins up the stairs, but doesn\\'t realize that LUMIERE is\\n              watching her.)  That\\'s funny, I\\'m sure there was someone...\\n              I-I-Is there anyone here?\\n(MAURICE\\'s voice echoes from his cell)\\nMAURICE:      Belle?\\nBELLE:        (Rushes up to the cell to find him) Oh, Papa!\\nMAURICE:      How did you find me?\\nBELLE:        Oh, your hands are like ice.  We have to get you out of here.\\nMAURICE:      Belle, I want you to leave this place.\\nBELLE:        Who\\'s done this to you?\\nMAURICE:      No time to explain. You must go...now!\\nBELLE:        I won\\'t leave you!\\n(Suddenly, BEAST grabs BELLE\\'s shoulder and whips her around.  She drops the\\ntorch she was carrying into a puddle and the room is dark except for one beam\\nof\\nlight from a skylight.)\\nBEAST:        What are you doing here?\\nMAURICE:      Run, Belle!\\nBELLE:        Who\\'s there? Who are you?\\nBEAST:        The master of this castle.\\nBELLE:        I\\'ve come for my father.  Please let him out!  Can\\'t you see he\\'s\\n              sick?\\nBEAST:        Then he shouldn\\'t have trespassed here.\\nBELLE:        But he could die.  Please, I\\'ll do anything!\\nBEAST:        There\\'s nothing you can do.  He\\'s my prisoner.\\nBELLE:        Oh, there must be some way I can...wait!  Take me, instead!\\nBEAST:        You! You would take his place?\\nMAURICE:      Belle!  No!  You don\\'t know what you\\'re doing!\\nBELLE:        If I did, would you let him go?\\nBEAST:        Yes, but you must promise to stay here forever.\\n(BELLE ponders the situation and realizes she can\\'t see the captor)\\nBELLE:        Come  into the light.\\n(BEAST drags his legs, then his whole body into the beam of light.  BELLE\\nlooks,\\nher eyes growing wider until she can stand no more and falls back to MAURICE.)\\nMAURICE:      No, Belle.  I won\\'t let you do this!\\n(BELLE regains her composure, then steps into the beam of light, giving her a\\nvery virgin-ish look)\\nBELLE:        You have my word.\\nBEAST:        (quickly) Done!\\n(BEAST moves over to unlock the cell, and BELLE collapses to the floor with her\\nhead in her hands.  We hear the door being unlocked, then MAURICE rushing over\\nto BELLE.)\\nMAURICE:      No, Belle.  Listen to me.  I\\'m old, I\\'ve lived my life--\\n              (BEAST grabs him and drags him downstairs)\\nBELLE:        Wait!\\nMAURICE:      Belle!\\nBELLE:        Wait!\\n(Cut to ext. of castle.  BEAST drags MAURICE towards PALLENQUIN)\\nMAURICE:      No, please spare my daughter!\\nBEAST:        She\\'s no longer your concern.  (BEAST throws MAURICE into the\\n              PALLENQUIN.) Take him to the village.\\n(The PALLENQUIN breaks the ivy holding it to the ground, then slinks off like a\\nspider with MAURICE inside)\\nMAURICE:      Please, let me out, please!\\n(Cut to BELLE looking out cell window at the PALLENQUIN crossing the bridge\\nover\\nthe moat.  She begins to cry. Cut to BEAST walking up the stairs.  LUMIERE is\\nstill at his post.)\\nLUMIERE:      Master?\\nBEAST:        (angrily) What!\\nLUMIERE:      Since the girl is going to be with us for quite some time, I was\\n              thinking that you might want to offer her a more comfortable\\n              room. (BEAST growls angrily at him.) Then again, maybe not.\\n(BEAST enters the cell where BELLE is still crying.)\\nBELLE:        You didn\\'t even let me say good bye. I\\'ll never see him again. I\\n              didn\\'t get to say good-bye.\\nBEAST:        (feeling bad) I\\'ll show you to your room.\\nBELLE:        (surprised) My room? (Indicating the cell) But I thought--\\nBEAST:        You wanna, you wanna stay in the tower?\\nBELLE:        No.\\nBEAST:        Then follow me.\\n\\n(BEAST leads BELLE to her room.  As they proceed, BELLE begins to lag behind.\\nShe looks at the hideous sculptures on the walls and the light casting shadows\\non them.  Frightened, she gasps and runs to catch up with BEAST, who is\\ncarrying\\nLUMIERE as a light source. BEAST looks back at BELLE, and sees a tear form at\\nthe corner of her eye.)\\n\\nLUMIERE:      Say something to her.\\nBEAST:        Hmm?  Oh.  (To BELLE)  I...um...hope you like it here.  (He looks\\n              at LUMIERE for approval.  He motions BEAST to continue.)  The\\n              castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you wish, except\\n              the West Wing.\\nBELLE:        (looking intrigued) What\\'s in the West Wing?\\nBEAST:        (stopping angrily) It\\'s forbidden!\\n\\n(BEAST continues, and BELLE reluctantly follows. Cut to int. of BELLE\\'s room,\\ndark.  The door opens and light spills in.)\\n\\nBEAST:        (Tenderly) Now, if there\\'s anything you need, my servants will\\n              attend you.\\nLUMIERE:      (whispering in his ear) Dinner--invite her to dinner.\\nBEAST:        (Growing angry) You...will join me for dinner.  That\\'s not a\\n              request!\\n(BEAST leaves, slamming the door behind him.  BELLE, terrified, runs over to\\nthe\\nbed and flings herself onto it, finally breaking down and crying.  Fade to\\ntavern in the town.)\\n\\nGASTON:       Who does she think she is?  That girl has tangled with the wrong\\n              man.  No one says \\'no\\' to Gaston!\\nLEFOU:        Darn right!\\nGASTON:       Dismissed.  Rejected.  Publicly humiliated.  Why, it\\'s more than\\nI\\n              can bear. (turns chair away)\\nLEFOU:        (Runs in front of him) More beer?\\nGASTON:       (Turns chair away again) What for?  Nothing helps.  I\\'m\\ndisgraced.\\nLEFOU:        Who, you?  Never.

And every last bit of me\\'s covered with hair!\\n(GASTON fights with the men, then lifts a bench with the BIMBETTES on it.  He\\ndrops the bench on LEFOU, then turns to the camera and reveals his hairy\\nchest.)\\n\\nOLD CRONIES:  No one hits like Gaston, matches wits like Gaston\\nLEFOU:        In a spitting match, nobody spits like Gaston!\\nGASTON:       I\\'m especially good at expectorating! Ptooey!\\nALL:          Ten points for Gaston!\\n(GASTON plays a chess game with a man, then hits the board, sending it and\\npieces all over.

Here we are.\\n              (One door opens, the other serves as an arm. It pulls out a pink\\n              dress.) Ah! There, you\\'ll look ravishing in this one!

BEAST wipes the silly face off, and looks to the door\\nexpectantly.)\\nLUMIERE:      Here she is!\\n(COGSWORTH enters.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    Uh, good evening.\\n(BEAST goes from expectant to mad.)\\nBEAST:        (growling) Well, where is she?\\nCOGSWORTH:    (buying time) Who?  Oh!  The girl. Yes,  the, ah, girl.  Well,\\n              actually, she\\'s in the process of, ah, um, circumstances being\\n              what they are, ah... she\\'s not coming.\\n(Cut to ext of den with door slightly ajar)\\nBEAST:        WHAT!!!!!!!\\n(Door bangs open and BEAST comes running out, with OBJECTS giving chase)\\nCOGSWORTH:    Your grace! Your eminence!  Let\\'s not be hasty!\\n(Cut to ext of BELLE\\'s room. BEAST runs up to it and bangs on the door.)\\nBEAST:        (Yelling) I thought I told you to come down to dinner!\\nBELLE:        (From behind the door) I\\'m not hungry.\\nBEAST:        You\\'ll come out or I\\'ll...I\\'ll break down the door!\\nLUMIERE:      (interrupting) Master, I could be wrong, but that may not be the\\n              best way to win the girl\\'s affections.\\nCOGSWORTH:    (pleading) Please! Attempt to be a gentleman.\\nBEAST:        (growing angrier) But she is being so...difficult!\\nMRS. POTTS:   Gently, gently.\\nBEAST:        (very dejected) Will you come down to dinner?\\nBELLE:        No!\\n(BEAST looks at the OBJECTS, very frustrated.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    Suave.  Genteel.\\nBEAST:        (Trying to act formal, bowing at the door) It would give me great\\n              pleasure if you would join me for dinner.\\nCOGSWORTH:    Ahem, ahem, we say \\'please.\\'\\nBEAST:        (once again dejected) ...please.\\nBELLE:        (Mad at BEAST) No, thank you.\\nBEAST:        (furious) You can\\'t stay in there forever!\\nBELLE:        (provokingly) Yes I can!\\nBEAST:        Fine!  Then go ahead and STARVE!!!! (To OBJECTS) If she doesn\\'t\\n              eat with me, then she doesn\\'t eat at all!\\n(BEAST runs back down the hall, slamming a door and causing a piece of the\\nceiling to fall on LUMIERE.)\\nMRS. POTTS:   That didn\\'t go very well at all, did it.\\nCOGSWORTH:    Lumiere, stand watch at the door and inform me at once if there\\n              is the slightest change.\\nLUMIERE:      (Taking guard position next to door)  You can count on me, mon\\n              capitan.\\nCOGSWORTH:    Well, I guess we better go downstairs and start cleaning up.\\n(Cut to int of BEAST\\'s lair. BEAST enters, knocking over and destroying things\\nin his path.)\\nBEAST:        I ask nicely, but she refuses.  What a...what does she want me to\\n              do--beg?  (Picking up the MAGIC MIRROR) Show me the girl.\\n(The MAGIC MIRROR shines, then glows green and reveals BELLE in her bedroom,\\ntalking to the WARDROBE)\\nWARDROBE:     (in mirror pleading) Why the master\\'s not so bad once you get to\\n              know him.  Why don\\'t you give him a chance?\\nBELLE:        (still disturbed by the attack) I don\\'t want to get to know him. \\n              I don\\'t want to have anything to do with him!\\nBEAST:        (setting down MAGIC MIRROR, speaking tenderly) I\\'m just fooling\\n              myself. She\\'ll never see me as anything...but a monster. (Another\\n              petal falls off the rose.)  It\\'s hopeless.\\n(BEAST puts his head in his hands as in a depressed state. Fade out/Fade in to\\next of BELLE\\'s room. Door creaks open.  BELLE silently emerges.  We see her\\nfeet\\ngo by as three bright spots shine through a curtain at floor level.  Behind it\\nare LUMIERE and FEATHERDUSTER.)\\nFEATHERDUSTER:\\n              Oh, no!\\nLUMIERE:      Oh, yes!\\nFEATHERDUSTER:\\n              Oh, no!\\nLUMIERE:      Oh, yes, yes, yes!\\nFEATHERDUSTER:\\n              I\\'ve been burnt by you before!\\n(LUMIERE and FEATHERDUSTER have emerged and LUMIERE takes her in his arms.\\nSuddenly he looks up and sees BELLE walking down the hall.  He drops\\nFEATHERDUSTER.)\\nFEATHERDUSTER:\\n              Oof!\\nLUMIERE:      Zut alors! She has emerged!\\n(Cut to kitchen, where we find COGSWORTH,MRS. POTTS,CHIP and the STOVE.)\\nMRS. POTTS:   Come on, Chip.  Into the cupboard with your brothers and\\n              sisters. (helping him in)\\nCHIP:         But I\\'m not sleepy.\\nMRS. POTTS:   Yes you are.\\nCHIP:         No, I\\'m...not. (He falls asleep and MRS. POTTS shuts the cupboard\\n              door.)\\n(A banging of pots and pans comes from the STOVE.)\\nSTOVE:        I work and I slave all day, and for what?  A culinary masterpiece\\n              gone to waste.\\nMRS. POTTS:   Oh, stop your grousing.  It\\'s been a long night for all of us.\\nCOGSWORTH:    Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn.  After all,\\n              the master did say \\'please.\\'\\nMRS. POTTS:   But if the master doesn\\'t learn to control that temper, he\\'ll\\n              never break the--\\n(BELLE enters, and COGSWORTH cuts off MRS. POTTS before she can say \\'spell.\\')\\nCOGSWORTH:    (interrupting) Splendid to see you out and about, mademoiselle.\\n              (LUMIERE comes running in.) I am Cogsworth, head of the\\n              household.  (He leans over to kiss her hand, but LUMIERE butts\\n              in front of him.) This is Lumiere.\\nLUMIERE:      En chante, cherie.\\nCOGSWORTH:    (trying to talk around LUMIERE who is still kissing BELLE\\'s\\n              hand) If there\\'s anything...stop that...that we can...please\\n              (finally shoving him out of the way)...to make your stay more\\n              comfortable.  (LUMIERE burns the hand of COGSWORTH) Ow!!!!\\nBELLE:        I am a little hungry.\\nMRS. POTTS:   (excited, to the other tea pots) You are? Hear that? She\\'s\\n              hungry.  Stoke the fire, break out the silver, wake the china.\\n(The fire on the STOVE roars to life, and drawers open to reveal silverware\\nstanding at attention.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    (secretively) Remember what the master said.\\nMRS. POTTS:   Oh, pish tosh.  I\\'m not going to let the poor child go hungry.\\nCOGSWORTH:    (thinking he is giving in to the ultimate demand) Oh, all\\n              right.  Glass of water, crust of bread, and then--\\nLUMIERE:      Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.  She\\'s not our prisoner.  She\\'s\\n              our guest.  We must make her feel welcome here.  (to BELLE)\\n              Right this way, mademoiselle.\\nCOGSWORTH:    Well keep it down. If the master finds out about this, it will\\nbe our necks!\\nLUMIERE:      Of course, of course.  But what is dinner without a little music?\\n(LUMIERE has started out the swinging door.  He lets it close, and the door\\nhits\\nCOGSWORTH and sends him across the room to land in a pan filled with (what\\nlooks\\nlike) pancake batter. He screams his line as he is in flight.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    MUSIC!?!\\n(Cut to dining room, where BELLE is seated at the end of a long table.  LUMIERE\\nis on the table and a spotlight shines on him.)\\n\\nLUMIERE:      Ma chere, mademoiselle.  It is with deepest pleasure and\\n              greatest pride that I welcome you tonight.  And now, we invite\\n              you to relax. Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly\\n              presents...your dinner.\\n\\n              Be our guest, be our guest\\n              Put our service to the test,\\n              tie your napkin \\'round your neck, cherie\\n              and we provide the rest!\\n(The CHAIR has wrapped a napkin around the neck of BELLE, who takes it off and\\nplaces it on her lap.  The CHAIR\\'s arms put it\\'s hands on it\\'s \\'waist\\' as if it\\nwere mad.\\n              Soup du jour, hot hors d\\'oeuvres\\n              Why we only live to serve\\n              Try the grey stuff, it\\'s delicious\\n              Don\\'t believe me?  Ask the dishes!\\n(LUMIERE offers BELLE a plate of hors d\\'oeuvres.  She dips her finger in one,\\nand tastes it.)\\n              They can sing, they can dance\\n              After all, miss, this is France!\\n              And a dinner here is never second best!\\n              Go on unfold your menu, take a glance and then you\\'ll\\n              Be our guest, be our guest, be our guest!\\n(A cabinet at the end of the table opens to reveal a large CHINA collection,\\nwhich rolls out and begins to perform. LUMIERE hands BELLE a menu, which she\\nbegins to read.)\\n              Beef ragout, cheese souffle,\\n              Pie and pudding en flambe!\\n              We\\'ll prepare and serve with flair\\n              A culinary cabaret!\\n(Plates of food go dancing by, with COGSWORTH in the pudding.  LUMIERE sets his\\ntorch to it, and it explodes, turning COGSWORTH\\'s face black with soot.)\\n              You\\'re alone and you\\'re scared,\\n              But the banquet\\'s all prepared!\\n              No one\\'s gloomy or complaining,\\n              While the flatware\\'s entertaining!\\n(The FLATWARE enters a \\'Busby Berlkley-esque\\' swimming scene.) \\n              We tell jokes, I do tricks\\n              With my fellow candlesticks\\n(LUMIERE, standing on a plate, is elevated and begins to juggle his candles.\\nMUGS enter the shot.)\\nMUGS:         And it\\'s all in perfect taste\\n              That you can bet!!!\\n(The MUGS begin a gymnastics routine, hopping over one another and passing a\\nbeverage from one to the next)\\nALL:          Come on and lift your glass,\\n              You\\'ve won your own free pass\\n              To be our guest, be our guest, be our guest!\\nLUMIERE:      If you\\'re stressed, it\\'s fine dining we suggest!\\nALL:          Be our guest, be our guest, be our guest!\\n(ALL leave except COGSWORTH, who looks scared, then begins to inch away.\\nLUMIERE\\nenters and holds him there.)\\nLUMIERE:      Life is so unnerving,\\n              For a servant who\\'s not serving!\\n              He\\'s not whole without a soul to wait upon\\nCOGSWORTH:    Get off!\\nLUMIERE:      Ah, those good old days when we were useful\\n              Suddenly, those good old days are gone.\\n(LUMIERE sings as if he were reminiscing.  Snow begins to fall.  COGSWORTH\\nlooks\\nup and sees the salt and pepper shakers doing their thing.)\\nLUMIERE:      Ten years we\\'ve been rusting\\n              Needing so much more than dusting\\n              Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills!\\n(LUMIERE dusts the salt of the head of COGSWORTH, who tries to escape.  He\\ntrips\\nand falls into the gelatin mold.) \\n              Most days just lay around the castle,\\n              Flabby fat and lazy\\n              You walked in, and oops-a-daisie!\\n(LUMIERE jumps on a spoon in the gelatin, which catapults COGSWORTH out of the\\nmold. Cut to kitchen, where MRS. POTTS is surrounded by soap bubbles.)\\nMRS. POTTS:   It\\'s a guest, it\\'s a guest!\\n              Sakes alive, well I\\'ll be blessed!\\n              Wine\\'s been poured and thank the Lord\\n              I\\'ve had the napkins freshly pressed!\\n(MRS.

POTTS is cleaned off by a napkin.  She hops onto the tea cart and rolls\\ninto the dining room, where she offers tea to BELLE.)\\nALL:          She\\'s our guest!\\nMRS. POTTS:   She\\'s our guest!\\nALL:          She\\'s our guest!\\n              Be our guest! Be our guest!\\n              Our command is your request!\\n              It\\'s ten years since we had anybody here\\n              And we\\'re obsessed!\\n\\n              With your meal, with your ease,\\n              Yes indeed, we aim to please\\n              While the candlelight\\'s still glowing\\n              Let us help you, we\\'ll keep going--\\n(The CHINA and CANDLESTICKS perform an elaborately choreographed dance\\nsequence,\\nending in a c.u. of LUMIERE.)\\n\\nALL (esp. LUMIERE):\\n              Course, by course\\n              One by one\\n              \\'Til you shout \"Enough, I\\'m done!\"\\n              Then we\\'ll sing you off to sleep as you digest\\n              Tonight you\\'ll prop your feet up,\\n              But for let\\'s eat up\\n              Be our guest!  Be our guest!  Be our guest! Please Be our guest!!\\n(A fantastic ending comes of the song, with SILVERWARE flying through the air,\\nPLATES and FEATHERDUSTERS dancing, and COGSWORTH the focus of attention, until\\nLUMIERE comes sliding in and sends him flying out of camera range.)\\nBELLE:        Bravo!  That was wonderful!\\nCOGSWORTH:    Thank you, thank you, mademoiselle. Yes, good show, wasn\\'t it\\n              everyone.  (Looking at his own face) Oh, my goodness, will you\\n              look at the time.  Now, it\\'s off to bed, off to bed!\\n(LUMIERE comes up next to COGSWORTH.)\\nBELLE:        Oh, I couldn\\'t possibly go to bed now.  It\\'s my first time in\\n              an enchanted castle.\\nCOGSWORTH:    Enchanted?  Who said anything about the castle being enchanted?\\n              (He tries to cover it up, just as a fork runs past.  To LUMIERE)\\n              It was you, wasn\\'t it!\\nBELLE:        I, um, figured it out for myself. (COGSWORTH and LUMIERE have\\nbeen\\n              fighting.  They both look at her, then stop.  COGSWORTH dusts\\n              himself off, and LUMIERE fixes his wax nose.) I\\'d like to look\\n              around, if that\\'s all right.\\nLUMIERE:      (excited) Oh!  Would you like a tour?\\nCOGSWORTH:    Wait a second, wait a second.  I\\'m not sure that\\'s such a good\\n              idea. (Confidentially, to LUMIERE) We can\\'t let her go poking\\n              around in certain places, if you know what I mean.\\nBELLE:        (Poking COGSWORTH in the belly (like the Pillsbury doughboy))\\n              Perhaps you could take me.  I\\'m sure you know everything there\\n              is to know about the castle.\\nCOGSWORTH:    (flattered) Well, actually, ah yes, I do!\\n(Fade to COGSWORTH, LUMIERE, and BELLE walking down a hall with FOOTSTOOL.\\nCOGSWORTH is lecturing.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    As you can see, the pseudo facade was stripped away to reveal a\\n              minimalist rococo design.  Note the unusual inverted vaulted\\n              ceilings.  This is yet another example of the neo-classic baroque\\n              period, and as I always say, if it\\'s not baroque, don\\'t fix it!\\n              Ha ha ha. Now then, where was I? (He turns to find the heads of\\n              the SUITS OF ARMOR have turned to follow BELLE.) As you were!\\n              (They all snap back to face forward.)  Now, if I may draw your\\n              attention to the flying buttresses above the--mademoiselle?\\n\\n(COGSWORTH turns back to the group and is one girl short. He sees her beginning\\nto climb the grand staircase. He and LUMIERE run up to her and jump in front of\\nher, blocking her progress upstairs.)\\n\\nBELLE:        What\\'s up there?\\nCOGSWORTH:    Where? Up there?  Nothing. Absolutely nothing of interest at all\\n              in the West Wing.  Dusty, dull, very boring.\\n(LUMIERE has been shaking his head, but COGSWORTH nudges him and he nods in\\nagreement.)\\nBELLE:        Oh, so that\\'s the West Wing.\\nLUMIERE:      (To COGSWORTH) Nice going!\\nBELLE:        I wonder what he\\'s hiding up there.\\nLUMIERE:      Hiding? The master is hiding nothing!\\nBELLE:        Then it wouldn\\'t be forbidden.\\n(She steps over them, but they dash up and block her again.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    Perhaps mademoiselle would like to see something else.  We have\\n              exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to...\\nBELLE:        (again stepping over them) Maybe later.\\nLUMIERE:      (with COGSWORTH, again dashing and blocking) The gardens, or the\\n              library perhaps?\\nBELLE:        (Now, with incredible interest) You have a library?\\nCOGSWORTH:    (Thrilled that he has found something to interest her) Oh yes!\\n              Indeed!\\nLUMIERE:      With books!\\nCOGSWORTH:    Gads of books!\\nLUMIERE:      Mountains of books!\\nCOGSWORTH:    Forests of books!\\nLUMIERE:      Cascades...\\nCOGSWORTH:    ...of books!\\nLUMIERE:      Swamps of books!\\nCOGSWORTH:    More books than you\\'ll ever be able to read in a lifetime!\\n              Books on every subject ever studied, by every author who ever\\n              set pen to paper...\\n\\n(LUMIERE and COGSWORTH begin marching off, and BELLE begins to follow, but her\\ncuriosity overtakes her, and she turns back to the West Wing.  Her excitement\\nbegins to dwindle, though, when she enters the hallway leading to BEAST\\'s lair.\\nAs she walks down the hall, she stops to look in a mirror that has been\\nshattered into several pieces, each one reflecting her concerned look.  She\\nreaches the end of the hall and finds a closed door with gargoyle handles.  She\\ntakes a deep breath, then reaches out and opens the door.  Cut to int of lair,\\nwhere BELLE begins to explore.  She is truly shocked by everything she sees.\\nShe wanders around, looking, and knocks over a table, but she catches it before\\nit crashes to the floor.  She then turns her head and sees a shredded picture\\non\\nthe wall.  We can only see part of a portrait.  It is the same portrait that\\nwas\\nshredded in the opening. BELLE reaches out and lifts the shreds of the picture\\nto reveal the prince.  We never see this, however, for then she turns her head\\nand sees the rose under the bell jar.  She walks over to it, her eyes\\ntransfixed.  She reaches out, then lifts off the jar, leaving the rose\\nunprotected.  She reaches up, brushes back the strand of hair that has been\\nrepeatedly falling on her forehead, then reaches out to touch the rose.  As she\\nnears it, a shadow falls over her.  BEAST has been on the balcony, and sees\\nher.\\nHe jumps back into the room,then slams the jar back on the rose.  He then turns\\nhis attention to BELLE.)\\nBEAST:        (growing angry) Why did you come here?\\nBELLE:        (Backing away, scared) I\\'m sorry,\\nBEAST:        I warned you never to come here!\\nBELLE:        I didn\\'t mean any harm.\\nBEAST:        (Angrier) Do you realize what you could have done? (Begins to\\n              thrash at the furniture)\\nBELLE:        (Pleading, but still scared) Please, stop! No!\\nBEAST:        (Screaming) Get out!!!! GET OUT!!!!\\n\\n(BELLE turns and flees the room.  BEAST calms down, then falls into despair,\\nfinally realizing that he may have destroyed his chances with BELLE.  She\\nreaches the stairway and grabs her cloak.  She rushes down the stairs, wrapping\\nthe cloak around her and bursting past a confused LUMIERE and COGSWORTH .)\\nLUMIERE:      Wh- Where are you going?\\nBELLE:        Promise or no promise, I can\\'t stay here another minute!\\nCOGSWORTH:    Oh no, wait, please wait!\\n(LUMIERE tries to respond, but BELLE slams the door behind her.  He and\\nCOGSWORTH both bow their heads in sadness.  Cut to BELLE outside in the forest\\non PHILLIPE.  She begins to ride through the forest, but PHILLIPE comes to a\\nstop.  She looks up and sees the WOLVES.  She gasps, then pulls the reins and\\nbegins to flee.  She runs from side to side, making the WOLVES hit the trees (a\\nla Speederbike chase in Return of the Jedi).  PHILLIPE runs out on a frozen\\npond, but his and BELLE\\'s weight collapse the ice.  The WOLVES chase her into\\nthe water.  Some begin to drown, but PHILLIPE is able to get out of the water\\nbefore anything serious happens.  He runs into a clearing, but becomes\\nsurrounded by WOLVES.  He bucks, throwing BELLE off and wrapping the reins\\naround a tree branch.  The WOLVES begin their attack on PHILLIPE, but BELLE\\ncomes to his rescue and beats them away with a stick.  One WOLF grabs the stick\\nin its mouth and breaks half of it off, leaving BELLE defenseless.  Another\\nleaps at her, grabbing the corner of her cloak and dragging her to the ground.\\nShe looks up and sees a WOLF about to jump on top of her.  It leaps and is\\ncaught in mid-air by BEAST.    He throws the WOLF away, then stands behind them\\nand BELLE.  They lunge at each other.  One rips a hole in BEAST\\'s shoulder, and\\nthe others focus their attack on that spot.  Finally, BEAST throws a WOLF\\nagainst a tree, knocking it out.  The others turn and run in fear.  BEAST turns\\nback to BELLE, looks at her despairingly, then collapses.  BELLE, grateful to\\nbe\\nalive, turns back to PHILLIPE and begins to get on, but her conscience takes\\nover, and she walks over to the fallen BEAST.  Fade to BELLE and PHILLIPE\\nwalking back to the castle, with BEAST on the horse\\'s back.  Fade to int of\\nden,\\nwith BELLE pouring hot water out of MRS. POTTS.  She soaks a rag in the water,\\nthen turns to BEAST, who is licking his wounds.)\\nBELLE:        Here now. Oh, don\\'t do that. (BEAST growls at her as she tries to\\nclean the wound with her rag.) Just...hold still.\\n(She touches the rag to the wound and BEAST roars in pain.  The OBJECTS, who\\nhave been watching, jump back into hiding from the outburst.)\\nBEAST:        That hurts!\\nBELLE:        (In counterpoint) If you\\'d hold still, it wouldn\\'t hurt as much.\\nBEAST:        Well if you hadn\\'t run away, this wouldn\\'t have happened!\\nBELLE:        Well if you hadn\\'t frightened me, I wouldn\\'t have run away!\\nBEAST:        (Opens his mouth to respond, but has to stop and think of a good\\n              line) Well you shouldn\\'t have been in the West Wing!\\nBELLE:        Well you should learn to control your temper!   (BEAST raises his\\n              hand to bring out another point, but finds he has none, so he\\n              bows his head down again.  The OBJECTS emerge from their hiding\\n              as BELLE has conquered the ferocious temper of BEAST.   BELLE\\n              moves the rag closer to the wound)  Now, hold still. This may\\n              sting a little.  (BEAST gives a surprised grunt, then grits his\\n              teeth as the rag is applied. BELLE speaks tenderly.)  By the way,\\n              thank you, for saving my life.\\n(BEAST opens his eyes, looking surprised.)\\nBEAST:        (Also very tenderly) You\\'re welcome.\\n(Camera zooms out and we see the OBJECTS looking on with interest.  Fade to\\nGASTON\\'s tavern, which is empty except for GASTON, LEFOU and MONSIEUR D\\'ARQUE,\\nwho are all sitting at a table.)\\nD\\'ARQUE:      I don\\'t usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night, but\\n              they said you\\'d make it worth my while.  (GASTON pulls out a\\n              sack of gold and tosses it in front of him.  He takes out a\\npiece,\\n              scrapes it on his chin and continues.)  Aah, I\\'m listening.\\nGASTON:       It\\'s like this.  I\\'ve got my heart set on marrying Belle, but she\\n              needs a little persuasion.\\nLEFOU:        (butting in) Turned him down flat!\\n(GASTON slams a beer mug on his head.)\\nGASTON:       Everyone knows her father\\'s a lunatic.  He was in here tonight\\n              raving about a beast in a castle...\\nD\\'ARQUE:      Maurice is harmless.\\nGASTON:       The point is, Belle would do anything to keep him from being\\n              locked up.\\nLEFOU:        Yeah, even marry him!\\n\\n(GASTON gives him another threatening look, and he ducks back under the mug.)\\nD\\'ARQUE:      So you want me to throw her father in the asylum unless she\\nagrees\\n              to marry you? (They both nod in agreement.)  Oh, that is\\n              despicable.  I love it!\\n(Cut to int of BELLE\\'s cottage.  MAURICE is packing to leave.)\\nMAURICE:      If no one will help me, then I\\'ll go back alone.  I don\\'t care\\n              what it takes.  I\\'ll find that castle and somehow I\\'ll get her\\n              out of there.\\n(MAURICE leaves on his journey.  Seconds later, GASTON and LEFOU arrive with\\nD\\'ARQUE. They enter the house looking for one of the residents.)\\nGASTON:       Belle! Maurice!\\nLEFOU:        Oh, well, I guess it\\'s not gonna work after all.\\n(GASTON grabs him by the neck and walks outside.)\\nGASTON:       They have to come back sometime, and when they do, we\\'ll be ready\\n              for them. (Drops LEFOU into a snowbank by the porch) Lefou,\\n              don\\'t move from that spot until Belle and her father come home.\\nLEFOU:        But, but... aww, nuts! (He pounds the side of the house and a\\npile\\n              of snow falls on his head.)\\n(Fade to ext of castle. BELLE is playing in the snow with PHILLIPE and\\nFOOTSTOOL.  BEAST, COGSWORTH and LUMIERE watch from the balcony.)\\nBEAST:        I\\'ve never felt this way about anyone.  (Looks excited) I want\\n              to do something for her. (Looks discouraged.) But what?\\nCOGSWORTH:    Well, there\\'s the usual things--flowers, chocolates, promises\\n              you don\\'t intend to keep...\\nLUMIERE:      Ahh, no no.  It has to be something very special.  Something that\\n              sparks her inter--wait a minute.\\n(Cut to int hallway leading to library. BEAST and BELLE are alone.)\\nBEAST:        Belle, there\\'s something I want to show you.  (Begins to open the\\n              door, then stops.) But first, you have to close your eyes. (She\\n              looks at him questioningly.) It\\'s a surprise.\\n(BELLE closes her eyes, and BEAST waves his hand in front of her.  Then he\\nopens\\nthe door. He leads her in.)\\nBELLE:        (Just as she enters the room) Can I open them?\\nBEAST:        No, no.  Not yet.  Wait here.\\n(BEAST walks away to draw back the curtains.  He does, and brilliant sunlight\\nspills into the room.  BELLE flinches reflexively as the light hits her face.)\\nBELLE:        Now can I open them?\\nBEAST:        All right.  Now.\\n(BELLE opens her eyes and the camera pulls back to reveal the gigantic library\\nfilled with books.)\\nBELLE:        I can\\'t believe it. I\\'ve never seen so many books in all my life!\\nBEAST:        You--you like it?\\nBELLE:        It\\'s wonderful.\\nBEAST:        Then it\\'s yours.\\nBEAST:        Oh, thank you so much.\\n(Cut to BELLE and BEAST in bkgd, with OBJECTS including CHIP in foreground\\nwatching them.)\\nMRS. POTTS:   Oh, would you look at that?\\nLUMIERE:      Ha ha! I knew it would work.\\nCHIP:         What?  What works?\\nCOGSWORTH:    It\\'s very encouraging.\\nFEATHERDUSTER:\\n              Isn\\'t this exciting!\\nCHIP:         I didn\\'t see anything.\\nMRS. POTTS:   Come along, Chip.  There\\'s chores to be done in the kitchen.\\nCHIP:         But what are they talking about? What\\'s going on?\\n(OBJECTS walk away. Fade to breakfast table with BELLE at one end and BEAST at\\nthe other, with MRS. POTTS between them. BELLE is served breakfast, and as she\\nbegins to eat, she looks at BEAST, gobbling up his food with no table manners\\nwhatsoever.  CHIP laughs, but MRS. POTTS shoots him an admonishing look.  BELLE\\nturns away and tries to ignore it, but CHIP comes to the rescue.  He nudges the\\nspoon with his nose, and BEAST reaches out for it (very 3-D-ishly).  BELLE\\nlooks\\nat him in wonder as he tries to eat with the spoon, but he has little success.\\nFinally, BELLE puts down her spoon and lifts her bowl as if in a toast.  BEAST\\nlooks at the compromise and does the same.  They both begin to sip their\\nbreakfast out of their bowls.  Fade to courtyard where BELLE and BEAST are\\nfeeding the birds.)\\nBELLE:        There\\'s something sweet\\n              And almost kind\\n              But he was mean\\n              And he was coarse and unrefined.\\n\\n              But now he\\'s dear\\n              And so unsure,\\n              I wonder why I didn\\'t see it there before.\\n(BELLE is trying to attract some birds to BEAST, who shoves a handful of seed\\nat\\nthem.  Finally, she takes a handful and gently spreads it out, creating a\\ntrail.\\nOne lands in his hands, and he looks up thrilled.)\\n\\nBEAST:        She glanced this way\\n              I thought I saw\\n              And when we touched\\n              She didn\\'t shudder at my paw\\n\\n              No it can\\'t be\\n              I\\'ll just ignore\\n              But then she\\'s never looked at me that way before.\\n\\n(BELLE has ducked around a tree, leaving BEAST with the birds.  She begins to\\nlook doubtful again, but turns her head around the tree and laughs.  BEAST is\\ncovered with birds.)\\n\\nBELLE:        New, and a bit alarming\\n              Who\\'d have ever thought that this could be?\\n              True, that he\\'s no Prince Charming\\n              But there\\'s something in him that I simply didn\\'t see.\\n\\n(BELLE throws a snowball at BEAST, who had looked at her proudly after the\\nbirds\\nflew away. He begins to gather a large pile of snow.  We cut to the OBJECTS,\\nlooking out of a window at the two. In the background, BELLE throws another\\nsnowball at BEAST, who drops his huge pile of snow on his head.  He chases her\\naround a tree, but she ducks around the other side and sneaks up on him from\\nbehind.)\\nLUMIERE:      Well who\\'d have thought?\\nMRS. POTTS:   Well bless my soul.\\nCOGSWORTH:    And who\\'d have known?\\nMRS. POTTS:   Well who indeed?\\nLUMIERE:      And who\\'d have guessed they\\'d come together on their own?\\nMRS. POTTS:   It\\'s so peculiar\\nALL:          We\\'ll wait and see\\n              A few days more\\n              There may be something there that wasn\\'t there before\\n(Fade to den where BELLE sits in front of a roaring fire and reads to BEAST.\\nOBJECTS inc. CHIP watch from doorway)\\nCOGSWORTH:    Yes, perhaps there\\'s something there that wasn\\'t there before.\\nCHIP:         What?\\nMRS. POTTS:   There may be something there that wasn\\'t there before.\\nCHIP:         What\\'s there, mama?\\nMRS. POTTS:   I\\'ll tell you when you\\'re older.\\n(Cut to int. of BEAST\\'s lair.  He is in the tub getting washed up for the big\\nnight with BELLE.  LUMIERE is there with him.)\\nLUMIERE:      Tonight is the night!\\nBEAST:        (hesitantly) I\\'m not sure I can do this.\\nLUMIERE:      You don\\'t have time to be timid.  You must be bold, daring.\\nBEAST:        Bold. Daring.  (BEAST has emerged from the tub and shakes himself\\n              dry.)\\nLUMIERE:      There will be music.  Romantic candlelight, provided myself, and\\n              when the time is right, you confess your love.\\nBEAST:        (Inspired) Yes, I -- I con--No, I can\\'t.\\nLUMIERE:      You care for the girl, don\\'t you?\\nBEAST:        More than anything.\\nLUMIERE:      Well then you must tell her.  (COATRACK has been cutting BEAST\\'s\\n              hair.  It finishes and steps back.) Voila.  You look so...so...\\n(Cut to shot of BEAST in pig-tails and bows.)\\nBEAST:        Stupid.\\nLUMIERE:      Not quite the word I was looking for.  Perhaps a little more off\\n              the top.\\n(COATRACK begins to cut and chop again. COGSWORTH enters.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    Ahem ahem ahem.  Your lady awaits.\\n(Cut to grand staircase, where BELLE descends from the West Wing side in a\\nglittering gold ball gown.  She reaches the landing and looks up at BEAST, who\\nis standing at the top of the stairs in his dress clothes.  He is nudged on by\\nLUMIERE from behind the curtain, and he descends and meets BELLE at the\\nlanding.\\nArm in arm, they descend the last section of stairs and continue on their way\\nto\\ndinner, stopped momentarily by FOOTSTOOL.  MRS. POTTS sings from her cart with\\nCHIP on board.)\\nMRS. POTTS:   Tale as old as time\\n              True as it can be\\n              Barely even friends\\n              Then somebody bends unexpectedly.\\n\\n              Just a little change\\n              Small to say the least\\n              Both a little scared\\n              Neither one prepared, beauty and the beast.\\n\\n(BELLE and BEAST have moved into the ballroom, where they move through a\\ncomputer perfect dance sequence.  BEAST occasionally looks over at LUMIERE and\\nCOGSWORTH for their approval.  MRS. POTTS and CHIP are in the ballroom on their\\ncart.)\\n\\nMRS. POTTS:   Ever just the same\\n              Ever a surprise\\n              Ever as before, ever just as sure\\n              As the sun will rise\\n              Tale as old as time\\n              Tune as old as song\\n              Bittersweet and strange,\\n              Finding you can change, learning you were wrong\\n \\n              Certain as the sun\\n              Rising in the east\\n              Tale as old as time,\\n              Song as old as rhyme, beauty and the beast.\\n\\n              Tale as old as time,\\n              Song as old as rhyme, beauty and the beast.\\n              (To CHIP) Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.  It\\'s past\\n              your bedtime.  Good night, love.\\n\\n(CHIP slides off the end of the cart, and hops out of the room, but comes back\\nfor one last look. BELLE and BEAST have adjourned to the balcony under a starry\\nnight.)\\n\\nBEAST:        Belle? Are you happy here with me?\\nBELLE:        (Hesitantly) Yes. (She looks off into the distance)\\nBEAST:        What is it?\\nBELLE:        (Looks at him desperately) If only I could see my father again,\\n              just for a moment.  I miss him so much.\\nBEAST:        (Looks disappointed for a moment, then excited.) There is a way.\\n\\n(The pair adjourn to BEAST\\'s lair, where BEAST hands BELLE the MAGIC MIRROR.)\\nBEAST:        This mirror will show you anything, anything you wish to see.\\nBELLE:        (Hesitantly) I\\'d like to see my father, please.\\n(The MAGIC MIRROR shines into life, and BELLE turns her head away as it\\nflashes.\\nThen it reveals MAURICE fallen in the woods, coughing and lost. BELLE is\\nshocked.  BEAST looks at her with concern.)\\n\\nBELLE:        Papa.  Oh, no.  He\\'s sick, he may be dying. And he\\'s all alone.\\n(BEAST turns, then looks at the rose, deep in thought.)\\nBEAST:        Then...then you must go to him.\\nBELLE:        What did you say?\\nBEAST:        I release you.  You are no longer my prisoner.\\nBELLE:        (In amazement) You mean...I\\'m free?\\nBEAST:        Yes.\\nBELLE:        Oh, thank you.  (To MAGIC MIRROR) Hold on, Papa.  I\\'m on my way.\\n(BELLE turns to leave, then turns back and pushes the MAGIC MIRROR back to\\nBEAST.)\\nBEAST:        Take it with you, so you\\'ll always have a way to look back, and\\n              remember me.\\nBELLE:        Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.\\n(BELLE turns to leave and BEAST looks down in depression.  She touches her hand\\nto his cheek and rushes out. We see BELLE\\'s skirt fly past COGSWORTH, who has\\nentered the room.)\\nCOGSWORTH:    Well, your highness.  I must say everything is going just\\n              peachy. I knew you had it in you.\\nBEAST:        (Very sad) I let her go.\\nCOGSWORTH:    Ha ha ha, yes.  Splend-- (COGSWORTH stops in the middle of his\\n              sentence.)  You what? How could you do that?\\nBEAST:        I had to.\\nCOGSWORTH:    (Still amazed) Yes, but why?\\nBEAST:        Because, I love her.\\n(Cut to COGSWORTH telling the rest of the OBJECTS about BEAST\\'s decision.)\\nALL (ex. COGSWORTH):\\n              He did what?!?!\\nCOGSWORTH:    Yes, I\\'m afraid it\\'s true.\\nCHIP:         She\\'s going away?\\nLUMIERE:      But he was so close.\\nMRS. POTTS:   After all this time, he\\'s finally learned to love.\\nLUMIERE:      That\\'s it, then.  That should break the spell.\\nMRS. POTTS:   But it\\'s not enough. She has to love him in return.\\nCOGSWORTH:    And now it\\'s too late.\\n(Cut to BEAST watching BELLE leave from above.  He roars in sorrow and anger.\\nHis roar turns into the sound of the wind.  BELLE is out in the snow, calling\\nout \"Papa?\"  Finally, she finds him face down in a snowbank.  They return home,\\nwhere LEFOU is still waiting, disguised as a snowman.)\\nLEFOU:        Oh, they\\'re back.\\n(Cut to black.  POV of MAURICE as his eyes open. He sees BELLE.)\\nMAURICE:      Belle?\\nBELLE:        It\\'s all right, Papa. I\\'m home.\\nMAURICE:      I thought I\\'d never see you again.\\nBELLE:        I missed you so much.\\nMAURICE:      But the beast.  How did you escape?\\nBELLE:        I didn\\'t escape, Papa.  He let me go.\\nMAURICE:      That horrible beast?\\nBELLE:        But he\\'s different, now.  He\\'s changed somehow.\\n(There is sound coming from BELLE\\'s pack.  The flap opens and the MAGIC MIRROR\\nfalls out with CHIP rolling to a stop on it.)\\nCHIP:         Hi!\\nBELLE:        Oh, a stowaway.\\nMAURICE:      Why, hello there, little fella.  Didn\\'t think I\\'d ever see you\\n              again.\\n(CHIP turns to BELLE with a look of question on his face.)\\nCHIP:         Belle, why\\'d you go away? Don\\'t you like us anymore?\\nBELLE:        Oh, Chip.  Of course I do.  It\\'s just that--\\n(There is a knocking at the door.  BELLE opens it and MONSIEUR D\\'ARQUE stands\\non\\nthe porch.)\\nBELLE:        May I help you?\\nD\\'ARQUE:      I\\'ve come to collect your father. (He steps aside to show the\\n              Asylum D\\'Loons wagon behind him.)\\nBELLE:        My father?\\nD\\'ARQUE:      Don\\'t worry, mademoiselle.  We\\'ll take good care of him.\\nBELLE:        My father\\'s not crazy.\\nLEFOU:        (Emerging from the crowd) He was raving like a lunatic. We all\\n              heard him, didn\\'t we!\\nBYSTANDERS:   Yeah!\\nBELLE:        No, I won\\'t let you.\\n(MAURICE has emerged from the home.)\\nMAURICE:      Belle?\\nLEFOU:        Ah, Maurice.  Tell us again, old man, just how big was the beast?\\nMAURICE:      (Struggling) Well, he was...that is...enormous. I\\'d say at least\\n              eight, no more like ten feet.  (CROWD laughs at him.)\\nLEFOU:        Well, you don\\'t get much crazier than that.\\nMAURICE:      It\\'s true, I tell you!\\n(D\\'ARQUE waves his arms and ORDERLIES move in and pick up MAURICE.)\\nLEFOU:        Take him away!\\nMAURICE:      Let go of me!\\n(GASTON has been watching from the sides, standing near D\\'ARQUE.)\\nBELLE:        (To D\\'ARQUE.) No, you can\\'t do this! (D\\'ARQUE shakes her off and\\n              walks away.)\\nGASTON:       Tsk, tsk, tsk. Poor Belle.  It\\'s a shame about your father.\\nBELLE:        You know he\\'s not crazy, Gaston.\\nGASTON:       I might be able to clear up this little misunderstanding, if...\\nBELLE:        If what?\\nGASTON:       If you marry me.\\nBELLE:        What?\\nGASTON:       One little word, Belle.  That\\'s all it takes.\\nBELLE:        Never!\\nGASTON:       Have it your way. (Turns and walks away slowly, playing hard to\\n              get.)\\nMAURICE:      (Being thrown into the wagon.) Belle? (She runs back into the\\n              house.) Let go of me!\\nBELLE:        (Comes back out with MAGIC MIRROR. She yells to the crowd.) My\\n              father\\'s not crazy and I can prove it!  (To MIRROR) Show me the\\n              beast! (MAGIC MIRROR again shines, then produces the image of\\n              the still depressed BEAST.  The crowd oohs and aahs at it.)\\nWOMAN 1:      Is it dangerous?\\nBELLE:        (Trying to reassure her) Oh, no.  He\\'d never hurt anyone. \\nPlease,\\n              I know he looks vicious, but he\\'s really kind and gentle.  He\\'s\\nmy\\n              friend.\\nGASTON:       If I didn\\'t know better, I\\'d think you had feelings for this\\n              monster.\\nBELLE:        He\\'s no monster, Gaston. You are!\\nGASTON:       She\\'s as crazy as the old man.  (He grabs the MIRROR from her\\n              hand.)\\n              The beast will make off with your children!\\n              He\\'ll come after them in the night.\\nBELLE:        No!\\nGASTON:       We\\'re not safe \\'til his head is mounted on my wall!\\n              I say we kill the beast!\\n(MOB cheers him and repeats the words \\'kill him\\'.)\\nMAN 1:        We\\'re not safe until he\\'s dead,\\nMAN 2:        He\\'ll come stalking us at night!\\nWOMAN 1:      Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite!\\nMAN 3:        He\\'ll wreak havoc on our village\\n              If we let him wander free\\nGASTON:       So it\\'s time to take some action, boys\\n              It\\'s time to follow me!\\n(GASTON throws a torch into a haystack, creating an instant bonfire.

Mufasa runs with the herd till slightly past the\\n tree. He whips around the front of some wildebeest and\\n runs into the herd towards Simba\\'s tree. He gets rammed\\n head-first once, throwing him to the ground. A wildebeest\\n hits Simba\\'s tree, throwing Simba into the air. Mufasa gets\\n up in time to catch Simba in the air with his mouth. He\\n gets hit again and accidentally throws Simba. Simba dodges\\n a few oncoming wildebeest. Mufasa runs by with the herd\\n and grabs Simba. He jumps up to a near rock ledge and sets\\n Simba down, but is immediately struck by a wildebeest and\\n carried off into the stampede.}\\n\\n Simba: DAD!\\n\\n {Simba watches in horror as he cannot find his father in\\n the swirling mass of wildebeest below him. At the last\\n second, Mufasa leaps out of the herd and starts to climb\\n with great difficulty up the sheer rock slope. Simba\\n turns and starts to climb up to the top of the gorge. Out\\n of Simba\\'s sight, Mufasa reaches a point right below a\\n ledge where he can\\'t climb due to the steepness. His claws are\\n scraping and his back paws have no traction. Above him on\\n the ledge is Scar.}\\n\\n Mufasa: Scar! Broth-- {slips, barely hangs on} Brother! Help me!\\n\\n {Scar looks disdainfully down, and then suddenly latches\\n onto Mufasa\\'s forepaws with claws extended.

His expression slowly\\n changes to one of horror as he recognizes Scar\\'s intent.}\\n\\n Scar: {Slowly and evilly} Long live the king.\\n\\n {Scar throws his brother backwards. Mufasa free-falls,\\n back first. The camera follows Mufasa down from under him,\\n then from above him, showing the stampede raging below.}\\n\\n Mufasa: Aaaaaaahh!\\n\\n {Camera suddenly focuses in on Simba, who is watching his\\n father hit the ground. No sound effects of the hit. No\\n view of it either. Mufasa and Simba\\'s screams mingle.}\\n\\n Simba: Nooooooo!\\n\\n {The herd passes. Everything is clouded by dust. Simba\\n bounds to the canyon floor. Mufasa is nowhere to be\\n seen.}\\n\\n Simba: {Cough} Dad!!\\n\\n {We hear a sound}\\n\\n Simba: {Quietly} Dad?\\n\\n {We see a stray wildebeest run past, the source of the\\n sound. The wildebeest curves around a log further down the\\n gully. Under the log is Mufasa, laying on his side. He is\\n not moving or breathing. Simba approaches the body. Sad\\n musical theme. Again we notice how small Simba really is.}\\n\\n Simba: {Hopefully} Dad? ...Dad, come on. {He rubs up\\n     against Mufasa\\'s cheek. The head merely rolls back in\\n     place after the rub} You gotta get up. {He places both\\n     forepaws on his father\\'s cheek and pushes} Dad.

And it\\'s great. {He sounds almost as\\n     if trying to convince himself as well as Nala.}\\n\\n Nala: {Voice catching, as though barely under control} We\\'ve \\n     really needed you at home.\\n\\n Simba: {Quieter} No one needs me.\\n\\n Nala: Yes, we do! You\\'re the king.\\n\\n Simba: Nala, we\\'ve been through this. I\\'m not the king.\\n     Scar is.\\n\\n Nala: Simba, he let the hyenas take over the Pride Lands.\\n\\n Simba: What?\\n\\n Nala: Everything\\'s destroyed. There\\'s no food. No water.\\n     Simba, if you don\\'t do something soon, everyone will\\n     starve.\\n\\n Simba: I can\\'t go back.\\n\\n Nala: {Louder} Why?\\n\\n Simba: You wouldn\\'t understand.\\n\\n Nala: What wouldn\\'t I understand?\\n\\n Simba: {Hastily} No, no, no. It doesn\\'t matter. Hakuna Matata.\\n\\n Nala: {Confused} What?\\n\\n Simba: Hakuna Matata. It\\'s something I learned out here.\\n     Look, sometimes bad things happen...\\n\\n Nala: Simba!\\n\\n Simba: (Continuing, irritated) ...And there\\'s nothing you can do\\n     about it. So why worry?\\n\\n {Simba starts away from Nala, walking on a fallen tree.  Nala\\n trots back up to him.}\\n\\n Nala: Because it\\'s your responsibility!\\n\\n Simba: Well, what about you? YOU left.\\n\\n Nala: I left to find help! And I found YOU. Don\\'t you\\n     understand? You\\'re our only hope.\\n\\n Simba: Sorry.\\n\\n Nala: What\\'s happened to you? You\\'re not the Simba I\\n     remember.\\n\\n Simba: You\\'re right. I\\'m not. Now are you satisfied?\\n\\n Nala: No, just disappointed.\\n\\n Simba: You know, you\\'re starting to sound like my father.\\n     {Walking away again}\\n\\n Nala: Good. At least one of us does.\\n\\n {Simba is obviously cut by the comment about his father;\\n he tears into Nala with his words.}\\n\\n Simba: {Angry} Listen, you think you can just show up and\\n     tell me how to live my life? You don\\'t even know what\\n     I\\'ve been through!\\n\\n Nala: I would if you would just tell me!\\n\\n Simba: Forget it!\\n\\n Nala: Fine!\\n\\n {Simba walks off. Camera switch to Simba pacing in a field.}\\n\\n Simba: She\\'s wrong. I can\\'t go back.  What would it prove,\\n     anyway? It won\\'t change anything. You can\\'t change the \\n     past.\\n\\n {He looks up at the stars.}\\n\\n     You said you\\'d always be there for me! But you\\'re not.\\n     And it\\'s because of me. It\\'s my fault. It\\'s my fault.\\n\\n {He bows his head, choking back tears. The camera backs to\\n a far view and then zooms over to Rafiki in a nearby tree.\\n We hear his chant. Just for fun, I\\'ve included its translation.}\\n\\n         Rafiki\\'s Chant:         Translation:\\n\\n         Asante sana!            [Thank you very much!]\\n         Squash banana!          [Squash banana!]\\n         We we nugu!             [You\\'re a BABOON,]\\n         Mi mi apana!            [And I\\'m not!]\\n\\n\\n {Simba seems slightly annoyed by the chant. He moves away.\\n Rafiki, elated by the sight of Simba, follows him.\\n Simba lies down on a log over a pond. A rock disturbs the\\n water; Rafiki, now in a nearby tree, starts his chant again.}\\n\\n Simba: Come on, will you cut it out?\\n\\n {Rafiki, laughing, is doing random acrobatics in the trees nearby.}\\n\\n Rafiki: Can\\'t cut it out. It\\'ll grow right back! {laughs}\\n\\n {Simba starts walking away. Rafiki follows.}\\n\\n Simba: Creepy little monkey. Will you stop following me?\\n     Who are you?\\n\\n Rafiki: {In front of Simba, then right in his face.} The\\n     question is: Whooo... are you?\\n\\n Simba: {Startled, then sighing} I thought I knew. Now I\\'m not so sure.\\n\\n Rafiki: Well, I know who you are. Shh. Come here. It\\'s a\\n     secret.\\n\\n {He pulls Simba\\'s head over to whisper into his ear. He\\n starts his chant into Simba\\'s ear and laughs.}\\n\\n     Asante sana!\\n     Squash banana!\\n     We we nugu!\\n     Mi mi apana!\\n\\n Simba: Enough already. what\\'s that supposed to mean,\\n     anyway?\\n\\n Rafiki: It means you are a baboon-- and I\\'m not. {laughs}\\n\\n Simba: {Moving away} I think... you\\'re a little confused.\\n\\n Rafiki: {Magically in front of Simba again} Wrong. I\\'m not the\\n     one who\\'s confused; you don\\'t even know who you are.\\n\\n Simba: {Irritated, sarcastic} Oh, and I suppose you know?\\n\\n Rafiki: Sure do; you\\'re Mufasa\\'s boy.\\n\\n {Simba is surprised by this revelation. Rafiki disappears\\n off stage right.}\\n\\n     Bye!\\n\\n {Cue music: \"Lala\" theme.}\\n\\n BS: We sangoma ngi velelwe  [Oh, spiritual healer, I\\'m troubled]\\n     We baba ngivelelwe      [Oh, my father, I\\'m in pain]\\n     We baba ngivelelwe      [Oh, my father, I\\'m in pain]\\n\\n Simba: Hey, wait!\\n\\n {Simba chases after him. When we catch up. Rafiki is in a\\n meditative lotus position on a rock.}\\n\\n        You knew my father?\\n\\n Rafiki: {Monotone} Correction-- I know your father.\\n\\n Simba: I hate to tell you this, but... he died. A long time\\n     ago.\\n\\n {Rafiki leaps off the rock over to a dense jungle-like area.}\\n\\n Rafiki: Nope. Wrong again! Ha ha hah! He\\'s alive! And\\n     I\\'ll show him to you. You follow old Rafiki, he knows\\n     the way. Come on!\\n\\n {Rafiki leads Simba through the brush. Simba has trouble\\n keeping up due to his size. The music slips into African\\n chant.}\\n\\n Rafiki: Don\\'t dawdle. Hurry up!\\n\\n Simba: Hey, whoa. Wait, wait.\\n\\n Rafiki: Come on, come on.\\n\\n Simba: Would you slow down?\\n\\n {Rafiki is seen flitting through the canopy ahead of Simba,\\n laughing hollowly and whooping.  Simba struggles to keep up.\\n Suddenly, Rafiki appears with his hand held up right into\\n Simba\\'s face.}\\n\\n Rafiki: STOP!\\n\\n {Rafiki motions to Simba near some reeds.}\\n\\n     Shhh.\\n\\n {He parts the reeds and points past them with his staff.}\\n\\n     Look down there.\\n\\n {Simba quietly and carefully works his way out. He looks\\n over the edge and sees his reflection in a pool of water\\n He first seems a bit startled, perhaps at his own mature\\n appearance, but then realizes what he\\'s looking at.}\\n\\n Simba: {Disappointed sigh} That\\'s not my father. That\\'s just\\n     my reflection.\\n\\n Rafiki: Noo. Look harder.\\n\\n {Rafiki motions over the pool. Ripples form, distorting Simba\\'s\\n reflection; they resolve into Mufasa\\'s face. A deep rumbling noise\\n is heard.\\n\\n     You see, he lives in you.\\n\\n {Simba is awestruck. The wind picks up. In the air the\\n huge image of Mufasa is forming from the clouds. He\\n appears to be walking from the stars. The image is ghostly\\n at first, but steadily gains color and coherence.}\\n\\n Mufasa: {Quietly at first} Simba . . .\\n\\n Simba: Father?\\n\\n Mufasa: Simba, you have forgotten me.\\n\\n Simba: No. How could I?\\n\\n Mufasa: You have forgotten who you are, and so have forgotten\\n     me. Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what\\n     you have become. You must take your place in the\\n     Circle of Life.\\n\\n Simba: How can I go back? I\\'m not who I used to be.\\n\\n {Shot of cloud-Mufasa, with glowing yellow eyes.  He is framed\\n in swirling clouds, radiating golden light.}\\n\\n Mufasa: Remember who you are. You are my son, and the one\\n     true king.\\n\\n {Close up of Simba\\'s face, bathed in the golden light, showing\\n a mixture of awe, fear, and sadness.  The image of Mufasa starts\\n to fade.}\\n\\n     Remember who you are.\\n\\n {Mufasa is disappearing rapidly into clouds. Simba runs into\\n the fields trying to keep up with the image.}\\n\\n Simba: No. Please! Don\\'t leave me.\\n Mufasa: Remember...\\n Simba: Father!\\n Mufasa: Remember...\\n Simba: Don\\'t leave me.\\n Mufasa: Remember . . .\\n\\n {Simba is left out in the fields. There is just a cloud\\n left where his father\\'s image was. The wind tosses the grass\\n restlessly. Rafiki approaches.}\\n\\n Rafiki: What was THAT? {laughs} The weather-- Pbbbah!\\n     Very peculiar. Don\\'t you think?\\n\\n Simba: Yeah. Looks like the winds are changing.\\n\\n Rafiki: Ahhh. Change is good.\\n\\n Simba: Yeah, but it\\'s not easy. I know what I have to do.\\n     But, going back means I\\'ll have to face my past. I\\'ve\\n     been running from it for so long.\\n\\n {Rafiki whacks Simba on the head with his staff.}\\n\\n     Oww! Jeez-- What was that for?\\n\\n Rafiki: It doesn\\'t matter; it\\'s in the past! {laughs}\\n\\n Simba: {Rubbing head} Yeah, but it still hurts.\\n\\n Rafiki: Oh yes, the past can hurt. But the way I see it,\\n     you can either run from it, or... learn from it.\\n\\n {He swings at Simba with his staff again. This time Simba\\n ducks.}\\n\\n     Hah, you see! So what are you going to do?\\n\\n Simba: First, I\\'m gonna take your stick.\\n\\n {Simba tosses Rafiki\\'s staff to the side.}\\n\\n Rafiki: No, no, no, no! Not the stick!\\n\\n {As Rafiki picks up his staff, Simba starts running off.}\\n\\n     Hey, where are you going?\\n\\n Simba: {Shouting back} I\\'m going back!\\n\\n Rafiki: Good! Go on! Get out of here! {laughs, hoots, n\\'\\n     hollers. As he holds his staff above his head, a few\\n     shooting stars zing across the sky.  Music rises into\\n     celebratory \"Busa\" theme:}\\n\\n BS: Busa le lizwe   {I actually hear this line as \"This land, invincible.\"}\\n     Busa le lizwe          [Rule this land]\\n     Busa le lizwe          [Rule this land]\\n     Busa lomhlaba          [Rule this land]\\n\\n     Sabusa le lizwe        [You shall rule this land]\\n     Sabusa le lizwe        [You shall rule this land]\\n     Sabusa le lizwe        [You shall rule this land]\\n     Busa lomhlaba          [Rule this land]\\n\\n [Timon and Nala Scene]\\n\\n {Camera switch to Timon and Pumbaa sleeping. Timon is\\n curled up on Pumbaa; Pumbaa is lying on his back. Both are\\n snoring. In his snore, Pumbaa occasionally mumbles\\n \"Grubs, grubs.\" Nala approaches and taps Timon with a paw.}\\n\\n Nala: Hey. Hey, wake up.\\n\\n {Timon wakes up and see a huge lion face in his view. He\\n starts screaming and Pumbaa joins in.}\\n\\n Nala: It\\'s OK. Whoa, whoa. It\\'s OK. It\\'s ME.\\n\\n Timon: Don\\'t ever do that again! Carnivores, oy!\\n\\n Nala: Have you guys seen Simba?\\n\\n Timon: {Holding a hand to his head} I thought he was with you.\\n\\n Nala: He was, but now I can\\'t find him. Where is he?\\n\\n {We hear Rafiki\\'s laugh; he\\'s sitting in a tree above them.}\\n\\n Rafiki: Ho, ho, ho, ho. You won\\'t find him here. Ha ha.\\n     The king... has returned.\\n\\n Nala: {Quietly} I can\\'t believe it. {louder, amazed} He\\'s\\n     gone back.\\n\\n Timon: Gone back? What do you mean? {Looks where Rafiki\\n     was; Rafiki is now gone} Hey! What\\'s goin\\' on here?\\n     Who\\'s the monkey?\\n\\n Nala: Simba\\'s gone to challenge Scar.\\n\\n Timon: Who?\\n\\n Nala: Scar.\\n\\n Pumbaa: Who\\'s got a scar?\\n\\n Nala: {Shaking head} No, no, no. It\\'s his uncle.\\n\\n Timon: The monkey\\'s his uncle?\\n\\n Nala: No! Simba\\'s gone back to challenge his uncle to take\\n     his place as king.\\n\\n Timon and Pumbaa: Ohhh.\\n\\n [Running Scene]\\n\\n {With accompanying music (a restatement of the \"Busa\" theme),\\n we see a far shot of Simba charging full speed across the\\n desert. A layover is faded in of Simba\\'s feet pounding the sand.}\\n\\n [Ledge Scene]\\n\\n {Simba slowly crosses the desolated land. He reaches\\n the lip of a cliff and looks out over his former home. Mostly\\n lacking in life, it is painted in grays. Seeing the desolation,\\n a look of determination, even fury, appears on Simba\\'s face.}\\n\\n Nala: Simba, wait up! {She trots up next to him on the ledge}\\n     ...It\\'s awful, isn\\'t it?\\n\\n Simba: I didn\\'t want to believe you.\\n\\n Nala: What made you come back?\\n\\n Simba: I finally got some sense knocked into me. And I\\'ve\\n     got the bump to prove it. Besides, this is my kingdom.\\n     If I don\\'t fight for it, who will?\\n\\n Nala: I will.\\n\\n Simba: It\\'s gonna be dangerous.\\n\\n Nala: {Quoting young Simba} Danger? Ha! I laugh in the\\n     face of danger. Ha ha ha ha.\\n\\n Timon: I see nothing funny about this.\\n\\n Simba: Timon? Pumbaa? What are you doing here?\\n\\n Pumbaa: {Bowing on one foreleg} At your service, my liege.\\n\\n Timon: Uh. We\\'re going to fight your uncle... for this?\\n\\n Simba: Yes, Timon; this is my home.\\n\\n Timon: Ffh. Talk about your fixer-upper. Well, Simba, if\\n     it\\'s important to you, {bows} we\\'re with you to the end.\\n\\n {Simba smiles appreciatively. Nice scene with the four\\n of them on the ledge viewing the work ahead of them.}\\n\\n [Hula scene]\\n\\n {Camera switches to Simba. Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa\\n sneaking up to the edge of Pride Rock. From behind a log,\\n they observe close up the hordes of hyenas.}\\n\\n Timon: Hyenas.

Dress in drag\\n     and do the hula?\\n\\n {Camera switch to Timon in a hula outfit. The music sung\\n is The Hawaiian War Chant much like the Spike Jones\\n arrangement. Pumbaa is set up like a roast pig, even with\\n an apple in his mouth. Jungle drum riff.}\\n\\n     Luau!\\n\\n     If you\\'re hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat\\n     Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he is a treat\\n\\n     Come on down and dine\\n     On this tasty swine\\n     All you have to do is get in line\\n\\n {Parenthetical parts are Pumbaa singing; the apple is at his feet.}\\n\\n     Aaaare you achin\\'\\n     (Yup, yup, yup)\\n     Foooor some bacon?\\n     (Yup, yup, yup)\\n     Heeee\\'s a big pig\\n     (Yup, yup)\\n     You could be a big pig too.\\n\\n     Oy!\\n\\n {The run off screaming to lead some of the hyenas away.\\n Simba and Nala make it by.}\\n\\n Simba: Nala, you find my mother and rally the lionesses.\\n     {determinedly} I\\'ll look for Scar.\\n\\n [Confrontation Scene]\\n\\n {Simba is making his way up Pride Rock. Scar calling his\\n mother causes him to pause and watch.}\\n\\n Scar: SARABI!\\n\\n {Sarabi ascends Pride Rock. The hyenas snap at her heels.\\n She only glares disdainfully at them.}\\n\\n Sarabi: Yes, Scar?\\n\\n Scar: Where is your hunting party? They\\'re not doing their\\n     job.\\n\\n Sarabi: {Calmly} Scar, there is no food. The herds have moved on.\\n\\n Scar: No. You\\'re just not looking hard enough.\\n\\n Sarabi: It\\'s over. There is nothing left. We have only one\\n     choice. We must leave Pride Rock.\\n\\n Scar: We\\'re not going anywhere.\\n\\n Sarabi: Then you have sentenced us to death.\\n\\n Scar: Then so be it.\\n\\n Sarabi: {Disgusted, amazed} You can\\'t do that.\\n\\n Scar: I\\'m the king.

He leaps out\\n and runs to his mother. Scar mistakes Simba as Mufasa\\n and is understandably frightened.}\\n\\n     Mufasa? No. You\\'re dead.\\n\\n {Sarabi awakens at her son\\'s nudge, but mistakes him as\\n Mufasa as Scar did.}\\n\\n Sarabi: Mufasa?\\n\\n Simba: No. It\\'s me.\\n\\n Sarabi: {Delighted} Simba?

The pressures of ruling a kingdom...\\n\\n Simba: ...Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.\\n\\n Scar: Oh, oh, ye-- Well, I would, heh, naturally, heh--\\n     however, there is one little problem. You see them?\\n     {pointing to the horde of hyenas on the rocks above}\\n     They think I\\'M king.\\n\\n {Nala appears with the rest of the lionesses.}\\n\\n Nala: Well, we don\\'t. Simba is the rightful king.\\n\\n Simba: The choice is yours, Scar. Either step down or\\n     fight.\\n\\n Scar: Oh, must it all end in violence? I\\'d hate to be\\n     responsible for the death of a family member. Wouldn\\'t\\n     you agree, Simba?\\n\\n Simba: That\\'s not gonna work, Scar. I\\'ve put it behind me.\\n\\n Scar: Eh, but what about your faithful subjects? Have they put\\n     it behind them?\\n\\n Nala: Simba, what is he talking about?\\n\\n Scar: {Delighted} Ahh, so you haven\\'t told them your little secret.\\n     Well, Simba, now\\'s your chance to tell them. Tell them\\n     who is responsible for Mufasa\\'s death!\\n\\n {Scar\\'s last line causes the lionesses to start.

Tell me it\\'s not true.\\n\\n Simba: {Regretfully} It\\'s true.\\n\\n Scar: You see! He admits it! Murderer!\\n\\n {Lightning crashes behind Scar\\'s head to punctuate the line.}\\n\\n Simba: No. It was an accident.\\n\\n {Scar walks around and around Simba as he accuses him; very nicely\\n done animated rotation.}\\n\\n Scar: If it weren\\'t for you, Mufasa would still be alive.\\n     It\\'s your fault he\\'s dead; do you deny it?\\n\\n Simba: No.\\n\\n Scar: {Severely} Then... you\\'re... guilty.\\n\\n Simba: No. I\\'m not a murderer.\\n\\n Scar: Oh, Simba, you\\'re in trouble again.

KNOWS...\\n     WHY!\\n\\n {Scar has been backing Simba up the length of Pride Rock.\\n After his last sentence, Simba slips over the edge and is\\n clinging to the ledge by his forepaws. Lightning strikes\\n below, igniting a fire.}\\n\\n Nala: Simba!\\n\\n {Scar sits back and pretends to think.}\\n\\n Scar: Now this looks familiar. Hmm.  Where have I seen\\n     this before? Let me think. Hmmm... hmmm. Oh yes,\\n     I remember. This is just the way your father looked\\n     before he died.\\n\\n {Scar grabs Simba with his claws as he did Mufasa. He\\n whispers into Simba\\'s ear.}\\n\\n     And here\\'s MY little secret: I killed Mufasa.\\n\\n {Simba has a quick memory flash back to that fateful\\n instant. His voice blends with his younger voice in the\\n scream of when his father died. In one giant leap he\\n lunges up and pins Scar on his back. Scar is caught completely\\n by surprise and is understandably very nervous and shaken.}\\n\\n Simba: NoooooOOOO! ...Murderer!\\n\\n Scar: No, Simba, please.\\n\\n Simba: Tell them the truth.\\n\\n Scar: Truth? But truth is in the eye of the beholdllgkkk!\\n\\n {Simba starts to choke Scar.}\\n\\n     All right. All right. {quietly, venomously} I did it.\\n\\n Simba: So they can hear you.\\n\\n Scar: {Grudgingly, but clear} I killed Mufasa!\\n\\n {Nala starts towards Scar, the hyenas attack Simba in a\\n wall of teeth.

Hey, lemme see. [Picks up fork.] Look at this. Wow - this is special - this is very, very unusual.\\nAriel:\\nWhat? What is it?\\nScuttle:\\nIt\\'s a dinglehopper! Humans use these little babies . . . to straighten their hair out. See - just a little twirl here an\\' a yank there and - voiolay! You got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over!\\nAriel:\\nA dinglehopper!\\nFlounder:\\nWhat about that one?\\nScuttle:\\n[Holding pipe] Ah - this I haven\\'t seen in years. This is wonderful! A banded, bulbous - snarfblat.\\nAriel and Flounder:\\nOohhh.\\nScuttle:\\nNow, the snarfblat dates back to prehistorical times, when humans used to sit around, and stare at each other all day. Got very boring. So, they invented the snarfblat to make fine music. Allow me.\\nScuttle blows into the pipe; seaweed pops out the other end.\\nAriel:\\nMusic? Oh, the concert! Oh my gosh, my father\\'s gonna kill me!\\nFlounder:\\nThe concert was today?\\nScuttle:\\n[Still contemplating pipe.] Maybe you could make a little planter out of it or somethin\\'.\\nAriel:\\nUh, I\\'m sorry, I\\'ve gotta go. Thank you Scuttle. [Waves.]\\nScuttle:\\nAnytime sweetie, anytime.\\nCut to Flotsam and Jetsam, then Ursula in background watching magic projection of Ariel swimming.\\nUrsula:\\nYeeeeeees, hurry home, princess. We wouldn\\'t want to miss old daddy\\'s celebration, now, would we? Huh! Celebration indeed. Bah! In MY day, we had fantastical feasts when I lived in the palace. And now, look at me - wasted away to practically nothing - banished and exiled and practically starving, while he and his flimsy fish-folk celebrate. Well, I\\'ll give \\'em something to celebrate soon enough. Flotsam! Jetsam! I want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his. She may be the key to Triton\\'s undoing. . . .\\nFade to the palace throne room where Ariel is being admonished.\\nTriton:\\nI just don\\'t know what we\\'re going to do with you, young lady.\\nAriel:\\nDaddy, I\\'m sorry, I just forgot, I -\\nTriton:\\nAs a result of your careless behaviour -\\nSebastian:\\nCareless and reckless behaviour!\\nTriton:\\n- the entire celebration was, er -\\nSebastian:\\nWell, it was ruined! That\\'s all. Completely destroyed! This concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career. Now thanks to you I am the laughing stock of the entire kingdom!\\nFlounder:\\nBut it wasn\\'t her fault! Ah - well - first, ahh, this shark chased us - yeah - yeah! And we tried to - but we couldn\\'t - and - grrrrrrrrr - and - and we - whoooaaaaaa - oh, and then we were safe. But then this seagull came, and it was this is this, and that is that, and -\\nTriton:\\nSeagull? What? Oh - you went up to the surface again, didn\\'t you? DIDN\\'T YOU?\\nAriel:\\nNothing - happened. . . .\\nTriton:\\nOh, Ariel, How many times must we go through this? You could\\'ve been seen by one of those barbarians - by - by one of those humans!\\nAriel:\\nDaddy, they\\'re not barbarians!\\nTriton:\\nThey\\'re dangerous. Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter snared by some fish-eater\\'s hook?\\nAriel:\\nI\\'m sixteen years old - I\\'m not a child anymore -\\nTriton:\\nDon\\'t you take that tone of voice with me young lady. As long as you live under my ocean, you\\'ll obey my rules!\\nAriel:\\nBut if you would just listen -\\nTriton:\\nNot another word - and I am never, NEVER to hear of you going to the surface again. Is that clear? [Ariel leaves, crying.]\\nSebastian:\\nHm! Teenagers. . . . They think they know everything. You give them an inch, they swim all over you.\\nTriton:\\nDo you, er, think I - I was too hard on her?\\nSebastian:\\nDefinitely not. Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I\\'d show her who was boss. None of this \"flitting to the surface\" and other such nonsense. No, sir - I\\'d keep her under tight control.\\nTriton:\\nYou\\'re absolutely right, Sebastian.\\nSebastian:\\nOf course.\\nTriton:\\nAriel needs constant supervision.\\nSebastian:\\nConstant.\\nTriton:\\nSomeone to watch over her - to keep her out of trouble.\\nSebastian:\\nAll the time -\\nTriton:\\nAnd YOU are just the crab to do it.\\nCut to Sebastian walking down corridor.\\nSebastian:\\nHow do I get myself into these situations? I should be writing symphonies - not tagging along after some headstrong teenager. [Sees Ariel and Flounder sneaking off and follows.] Hmm? What is that girl up to? [He barely makes it into cave and sees Ariel\\'s collection.] Huh?\\nFlounder:\\nAriel, are you okay?\\nAriel:\\nIf only I could make him understand. I just don\\'t see things the way he does. I don\\'t see how a world that makes such wonderful things - could be bad.\\n[singing]\\nLook at this stuff\\nIsn\\'t it neat?\\nWouldn\\'t you think my collection\\'s complete?\\nWouldn\\'t you think I\\'m the girl\\nThe girl who has ev\\'rything?\\nLook at this trove\\nTreasures untold\\nHow many wonders can one cavern hold?\\nLookin\\' around here you\\'d think\\nSure, she\\'s got everything\\nI\\'ve got gadgets and gizmos aplenty\\nI\\'ve got whozits and whatzits galore\\n[You want thingamabobs?\\nI got twenty]\\nBut who cares?\\nNo big deal\\nI want more\\nI wanna be where the people are\\nI wanna see\\nWanna see \\'em dancin\\'\\nWalkin\\' around on those\\n[Whad\\'ya call \\'em?\\noh - feet]\\nFlippin\\' your fins you don\\'t get too far\\nLegs are required for jumpin\\', dancin\\'\\nStrollin\\' along down a\\n[What\\'s that word again?] street\\nUp where they walk\\nUp where they run\\nUp where they stay all day in the sun\\nWanderin\\' free\\nWish I could be\\nPart of that world\\nWhat would I give\\nIf I could live\\nOutta these waters?\\nWhat would I pay\\nTo spend a day\\nWarm on the sand?\\nBetcha on land\\nThey understand\\nBet they don\\'t reprimand their daughters\\nBright young women\\nSick o\\' swimmin\\'\\nReady to stand\\nAnd ready to know what the people know\\nAsk \\'em my questions\\nAnd get some answers\\nWhat\\'s a fire and why does it\\n[What\\'s the word?]\\nburn?\\nWhen\\'s it my turn?\\nWouldn\\'t I love\\nLove to explore that shore above?\\nOut of the sea\\nWish I could be\\nPart of that world\\nSebastian has been struggling around and now comes crashing down making a lot of noise.\\nAriel:\\nSebastian!?\\nSebastian:\\nAriel - what, are you mad? How could you - what is all this?\\nAriel:\\nIt, err, it\\'s just my - collection. . . .\\nSebastian:\\nOh. I see. Your collection. Hmmm. IF YOUR FATHER KNEW ABOUT THIS PLACE HE\\'D -\\nFlounder:\\nYou\\'re not gonna tell him, are you?\\nAriel:\\nOh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand.\\nSebastian:\\nAriel. You\\'re under a lot of pressure down here. Come with me, I\\'ll take you home and get you something warm to drink. [A ship passes by overhead.]\\nAriel:\\nWhat do you suppose?. . .\\nSebastian:\\nAriel? Ariel!\\nOn surface. Fireworks in the sky around ship. Ariel looks on, amazed. Sebastian and Flounder arrive.\\nSebastian:\\nAriel, what - what are you- jumpin\\' jellyfish! Ariel, Ariel! Please come back! [Ariel swims to ship and watches party until Max finds her.]\\nEric:\\n[Whistles.] Max, here boy. Hey, come on, mutt, whatcha doing, huh Max? Good boy.

We\\'re being intrepidatious. WE\\'RE OUT TO DISCOVER! [Ariel grabs his beak.]\\nAriel:\\nI\\'ve never seen a human this close before. Oh - he\\'s very handsome, isn\\'t he?\\nScuttle:\\n[Looking at Max] I dunno, he looks kinda hairy and slobbery to me.\\nAriel:\\nNot that one - the one playing the snarfblat.\\nGrimsby:\\nSilence! Silence! It is now my honour and privilege to present our esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday present.\\nEric:\\nAh, Grimsby - y\\'old beanpole, you shouldn\\'t have.\\nGrimsby:\\nI know. Happy birthday, Eric! [Large, gaudy statue of Eric is revealed. Max growls.]\\nEric:\\nGee, Grim. It\\'s, err, it\\'s, err - it\\'s really somethin\\'. . . .\\nGrimsby:\\nYes, I commissioned it myself. Of course, I had hoped it would be a wedding present, but . . .\\nEric:\\nCome on, Grim, don\\'t start. Look, you\\'re not still sore because I didn\\'t fall for the princess of Glauerhaven, are you?\\nGrimsby:\\nOh, Eric, it isn\\'t me alone. The entire kingdom wants to see you happily settled down with the right girl.\\nEric:\\nWell, she\\'s out there somewhere. I just - I just haven\\'t found her yet.\\nGrimsby:\\nWell, perhaps you haven\\'t been looking hard enough.\\nEric:\\nBelieve me, Grim, when I find her I\\'ll know - without a doubt. It\\'ll just - bam! - hit me - like lightning. [Lightning and thunder appear and the sky grows dark.]\\nSailor:\\nHurricane a\\'commin\\'!! Stand fast! Secure the riggin\\'! [Storm hits.]\\nScuttle:\\nWhoa! The wind\\'s all of a sudden on the move here. [He is blown away.] Oh! Ariel . . . [Ship crashes through storm. Lightning starts a fire. A rock looms ahead.]\\nEric:\\nLook out! . . . [Ship crashes and all are thrown overboard except Max.] Grim, hang on! [Sees Max.] Max! [Goes back to save him.] Jump Max! Come on boy, jump! You can do it Max. [He saves Max but is trapped on board.]\\nGrimsby:\\nERIC! [Ship explodes. Ariel finds Eric near drowning and pulls him away.]\\nOn beach. Ariel is sitting next to an unconscious Eric.\\nAriel:\\nIs he - dead?\\nScuttle:\\n[Opens Eric\\'s eyelid.] It\\'s hard to say.

She was - singing . . . she had the most - beautiful voice.\\nGrimsby:\\nAh, Eric, I think you\\'ve swallowed a bit too much seawater. Off we go. Come on, Max.\\nSebastian:\\nWe just gotta forget this whole thing ever happened. The sea king will never know. You won\\'t tell him, I won\\'t tell him. I will stay in one piece.\\nAriel:\\nI don\\'t know when I don\\'t know how But I know something\\'s starting right now Watch and you\\'ll see Some day I\\'ll be Part of your world\\nFlotsam and Jetsam appear. Fade to Ursula watching from her chamber.\\nUrsula:\\nOh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I can\\'t stand it - it\\'s too easy. The child is in love with a human. And not just any human - a prince! Her daddy\\'ll LOVE that. King Triton\\'s headstrong, lovesick girl would make a charming addition to my little garden.\\nFade to palace.

In love?\\nCut to Sebastian pacing on rock outside.\\nSebastian:\\nO.K. So far, so good. I don\\'t think the king knows.

Who said anything about humans?\\nFade to Ariel and Flounder entering cave.\\nAriel:\\nFlounder, why can\\'t you just tell me what this is all about?\\nFlounder:\\nYou\\'ll see. It\\'s a suprise.\\nAriel:\\n[Sees statue of Eric.] Oh, Flounder- Flounder you\\'re the best! it looks just like him. It even has his eyes. \"Why, Eric, run away with you?

Not that I blame you - he is quite a catch, isn\\'t he? Well, angel fish, the solution to your problem is simple. The only way to get what you want - is to become a human yourself.\\nAriel:\\nCan you DO that?\\nUrsula:\\nMy dear, sweet child. That\\'s what I do - it\\'s what I live for. To help unfortunate merfolk - like yourself. Poor souls with no one else to turn to.\\n[singing]\\nI admit that in the past I\\'ve been a nasty\\nThey weren\\'t kidding when they called me, well, a witch\\nBut you\\'ll find that nowadays\\nI\\'ve mended all my ways\\nRepented, seen the light and made a switch\\nTrue? Yes\\nAnd I fortunately know a little magic\\nIt\\'s a talent that I always have possessed\\nAnd here lately, please don\\'t laugh\\nI use it on behalf\\nOf the miserable, lonely and depressed\\n[Pathetic]\\nPoor unfortunate souls\\nIn pain\\nIn need\\nThis one longing to be thinner\\nThat one wants to get the girl\\nAnd do I help them?\\nYes, indeed\\nThose poor unfortunate souls\\nSo sad\\nSo true\\nThey come flocking to my cauldron\\nCrying, \"Spells, Ursula please!\"\\nAnd I help them?\\nYes, I do\\nNow it\\'s happened once or twice\\nSomeone couldn\\'t pay the price\\nAnd I\\'m afraid I had to rake \\'em \\'cross the coals\\nYes, I\\'ve had the odd complaint\\nBut on the whole I\\'ve been a saint\\nTo those poor unfortunate souls\\nNow, here\\'s the deal. I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days. Got that? Three days. Now listen, this is important. Before the sun sets on the third day, you\\'ve got to get dear ol\\' princey to fall in love with you. That is, he\\'s got to kiss you. Not just any kiss - the kiss of true love. If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you\\'ll remain human, permanently, but - if he doesn\\'t, you turn back into a mermaid, and - you belong to me.\\n\\nSebastian:\\nNo Ariel! [He is silenced by Flotsam and Jetsam.]\\nUrsula:\\nHave we got a deal?\\nAriel:\\nIf I become human, I\\'ll never be with my father or sisters again.\\nUrsula:\\nThat\\'s right. . . . But - you\\'ll have your man. Life\\'s full of tough choices, innit? Oh - and there is one more thing. We haven\\'t discussed the subject of payment. You can\\'t get something for nothing, you know.\\nAriel:\\nBut I don\\'t have any -\\nUrsula:\\nI\\'m not asking much. Just a token, really, a trifle. You\\'ll never even miss it. What I want from you is . . . your voice.\\nAriel:\\nMy voice?\\nUrsula:\\nYou\\'ve got it, sweetcakes. No more talking, singing, zip.\\nAriel:\\nBut without my voice, how can I -\\nUrsula:\\nYou\\'ll have your looks! Your pretty face! And don\\'t underestimate the importance of body language! Ha!\\n[singing]\\nThe men up there don\\'t like a lot of blabber\\nThey think a girl who gossips is a bore\\nYes, on land it\\'s much preferred\\nFor ladies not to say a word\\nAnd after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?\\nCome on, they\\'re not all that impressed with conversation\\nTrue gentlemen avoid it when they can\\nBut they dote and swoon and fawn\\nOn a lady who\\'s withdrawn\\nIt\\'s she who holds her tongue who gets her man\\nCome on, you poor unfortunate soul\\nGo ahead!\\nMake your choice!\\nI\\'m a very busy woman\\nAnd I haven\\'t got all day\\nIt won\\'t cost much\\nJust your voice!\\nYou poor unfortunate soul\\nIt\\'s sad\\nBut true\\nIf you want to cross a bridge, my sweet\\nYou\\'ve got to pay the toll\\nTake a gulp and take a breath\\nAnd go ahead and sign the scroll!\\nFlotsam, Jetsam, now I\\'ve got her, boys\\nThe boss is on a roll\\nThis poor unfortunate soul.\\n[Ariel signs contract.]\\nPaluga, sarruga, come winds of the Caspian Sea.\\nNow rings us glossitis and max laryngitis,\\nLa voce to me!\\nNow . . . sing!\\nAriel:\\n[Sings.]\\nUrsula:\\nKeep singing! [Giant magical hands rip out Ariel\\'s voice and give it to Ursula. She laughs as Ariel is changed into a human and rushed to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian.]\\nFade to beach. Eric and Max are walking near castle.\\nEric:\\n[Playing flute.] That voice. I can\\'t get it out of my head. I\\'ve looked everywhere, Max - where could she be? [On other side of rocks Ariel is washed up. Sebastian and Flounder are exausted. Ariel sees her legs and is amazed.]\\nScuttle:\\nWell, look at what the catfish dragged in! Look at ya! Look at ya! There\\'s something different. Don\\'t tell me - I got it. It\\'s your hairdo, right? You\\'ve been using the dinglehopper, right? No? No huh, well let me see. New . . . seashells? No new seashells. I gotta admit I can\\'t put my foot on it right now, but if I just stand here long enough I know that I\\'ll -\\nSebastian:\\nSHE\\'S GOT LEGS, YOU IDIOT! She traded her voice to the sea witch and got legs. Jeez, man . . .\\nScuttle:\\nI knew that.\\nFlounder:\\nAriel\\'s been turned into a human. She\\'s gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he\\'s gotta ki- he\\'s gotta kiss her. [Ariel tries to get up.]\\nSebastian:\\nAnd she\\'s only got three days. Just look at her. On legs. On human legs! My nerves are shot. This is a catastrophe! What would her father say? I\\'ll tell you what her father\\'d say, he\\'d say he\\'s gonna kill himself a crab, that\\'s what her father\\'d say! I\\'m gonna march meself straight home right now and tell him just like I shoulda done de minute- [Ariel grabs him.] . . . and don\\'t you shake your head at me, young lady. Maybe there\\'s still time. If we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with all the normal fish, and just be . . . just be . . . just be miserable for the rest of your life. All right, all right. I\\'ll try to help you find that prince. Boy. What a soft-shell I\\'m turning out to be.\\nScuttle:\\nNow, Ariel, I\\'m tellin\\' ya, if you wanna be a human the first thing you gotta do is dress like one. Now lemme see.\\nCut to Eric and Max. Max smells Ariel and gets excited.\\nEric:\\nMax? Huh . . . what, Max!\\nScuttle:\\n[Whistles.] Ya look great kid. Ya look - sensational. [They hear Max. He arrives and chases Ariel up on a rock.]\\nEric:\\nMax . . . Max - Quiet Max! What\\'s gotten into you fella? [Sees Ariel.] Oh . . . Oh, I see. Are you O.K., miss? I\\'m sorry if this knucklehead scared you. He\\'s harmless, really - . . . you . . . seem very familiar . . . to me. Have we met? We have met? I knew it! You\\'re the one - the one I\\'ve been looking for! What\\'s your name? [Ariel mouths \"Ariel\" but no words come out.] What\\'s wrong? What is it? You can\\'t speak? [Ariel shakes her head.] Oh. Then you couldn\\'t be who I thought. [Ariel and Max look frustrated. She tries pantomime.] What is it? You\\'re hurt? No, No . . . You need help.\\nShe falls into him.\\nEric:\\nWhoa, whoa, careful - careful - easy. Gee, you must have really been through something. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll help you. Come on . . . Come on, you\\'ll be okay.\\nFade to Ariel in bath playing with bubbles.\\nCarlotta:\\nWashed up from a shipwreck. Oh, the poor thing. We\\'ll have you feeling better in no time. [Picks up Ariel\\'s \"dress\"] I\\'ll just - I\\'ll just get this washed for you.\\nCut to Sebastian in dress getting washed.\\nWoman 1:\\nWell you must have at least heard about this girl.\\nWoman 2:\\nWell, Gretchen says . . . [Sebastian is dunked.] . . . since when has Gretchen got anything right. I mean really, this girl shows up in rags and doesn\\'t speak-\\nSebastian:\\nMadame, please ! . . .\\nWoman 2:\\n. . . not my idea of a princess. If Eric\\'s looking for a girl, I know a couple of highly available ones right here . . . [Sebastian dives into kitchen and sees various fish cooking. He faints.]\\nCut to castle dining room.\\nGrimsby:\\nOh, Eric, be reasonable. Nice young ladies just don\\'t - swim around rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then - flutter off into oblivion, like some -\\nEric:\\nI\\'m tellin\\' you, Grim, she was REAL! I\\'m gonna find that girl - and I\\'m gonna marry her.\\nCarlotta:\\nHa Ha. Come on honey. Don\\'t be shy. [Ariel enteres in a beautiful dress.]\\nGrimsby:\\nOh, Eric, isn\\'t she a vision?\\nEric:\\nYou look - wonderful.\\nGrimsby:\\nCome come come, you must be famished. Let me help you my dear. There we go - ah - quite comfy? Uh. It\\'s - It\\'s not ofen that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh Eric? [Ariel starts combing hair with a fork. They look dumbfounded and she is embarrased. She sees pipe and brightens.] Uh, do you like it? It is rather - fine . . . [She blows its contents into his face. Eric laughs.]\\nCarlotta:\\nOh, my!\\nEric:\\nAhem, so sorry Grim.\\nCarlotta:\\nWhy, Eric, that\\'s the first time I\\'ve seen you smile in weeks.\\nGrimsby:\\n[Wiping his face.] Oh, very amusing. Carlotta, my dear, what\\'s for dinner?\\nCarlotta:\\nOooh, you\\'re gonna love it. Chef\\'s been fixing his specialty, stuffed crab.\\nCut to Sebastian watching Louis cook. He is humming to himself.\\nLouis: (singing)\\nLes poissons\\nLes poissons\\nHow I love les poissons\\nLove to chop\\nAnd to serve little fish\\nFirst I cut off their heads\\nThen I pull out the bones\\nAh mais oui\\nCa c\\'est toujours delish\\nLes poissons\\nLes poissons\\nHee hee hee\\nHah hah hah\\nWith the cleaver I hack them in two\\nI pull out what\\'s inside\\nAnd I serve it up fried\\nGod, I love little fishes\\nDon\\'t you?\\nHere\\'s something for tempting the palate\\nPrepared in the classic technique\\nFirst you pound the fish flat with a mallet\\nThen you slash through the skin\\nGive the belly a slice\\nThen you rub some salt in\\n\\'Cause that makes it taste nice\\nZut alors, I have missed one!\\nSacre bleu\\nWhat is this?\\nHow on earth could I miss\\nSuch a sweet little succulent crab?\\nQuel dommage\\nWhat a loss\\nHere we go in the sauce\\nNow some flour, I think\\nJust a dab\\nNow I stuff you with bread\\nIt don\\'t hurt \\'cause you\\'re dead\\nAnd you\\'re certainly lucky you are\\n\\'Cause it\\'s gonna be hot\\nIn my big silver pot\\nToodle loo mon poisson\\nAu revoir!\\nSebastian hops back and Louis grabs him again.\\nLouis:\\nWhat is this? [Sebastian pinches his nose and a battle ensues. Louis knocks over a large cabinet.]\\nCut to dining room. Huge crash is heard.\\nCarlotta:\\nI think I\\'d better go see what Louis is up to.\\nBack to kitchen. Louis is trashing the place.\\nLouis:\\nCome out you little pipsqueak and fight like a man!\\nCarlotta:\\nLouis! What are you doing?\\nLouis:\\nWell - I - I was just - er, er, I\\'m sorry, madame.\\nCut back to dining room.\\nGrimsby:\\nYou know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy seeing some of the sights of the kingdom. Something in the way of a tour?\\nEric:\\nI\\'m sorry, Grim, what was that?\\nGrimsby:\\nYou can\\'t spend all your time moping about, you need to get out. Do something, have a life. [Grimsby lifts his plate\\'s cover to reveal Sebastian cowering in the salad.] Get your mind off -\\nEric:\\nEasy, Grim, Easy. [Ariel lifts her own plate cover and signals for Sebastian to hide there. Sebastian rushes across while no one is looking.] It\\'s not a bad idea. If she\\'s interested. Well - whaddaya say? Would you like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?\\nAriel nods vigorously, leaning heavily on her plate\\'s cover.\\nGrimsby:\\nWonderful, now let\\'s eat, before this crab wanders off my plate.\\nFade to Ariel watching Eric and Max from balcony.\\nEric:\\nCome here boy! . . . Arrr . . . [He sees Ariel and waves. She is embarassed and goes back inside.]\\nSebastian:\\nThis has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day of my life. I hope you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady. Now - we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you. Tomorrow, when he takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best. You gotta bat your eyes - like this. You gotta pucker up your lips - like this. [He sees she is asleep.] Hm. You are hopeless child. You know dat? Completely hopeless . . .\\nFade to undersea palace. Seahorse swims up to Triton.\\nTriton:\\nAny sign of them?\\nSeahorse:\\nNo, Your Majesty. We\\'ve searched everywhere. We\\'ve found no trace of your daughter - or Sebastian.\\nTriton:\\nWell, keep looking. Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored. Let no one in this kingdom sleep until she\\'s safe at home.\\nSeahorse:\\nYes sire. [He leaves.]\\nTriton:\\nOh, what have I done? What have I done?\\nMorning at castle. Ariel and Eric leave for their tour. Ariel is amazed by everything.\\nFlounder:\\n[As they pass water.] Has he kissed her yet?\\nSebastian:\\nNot yet.\\nFlounder:\\nOhh . . . [Ariel and Eric go dancing and see the town.]\\nScuttle:\\nYo, Flounder! Any kissing?\\nFlounder:\\nNo, not yet.\\nScuttle:\\nHmm. Well they - they better get crackin\\'. [They leave town and Ariel drives, almost crashing. They end up rowing on a still lagoon in the evening.]\\nFlounder:\\nMove over - move your big feathers. I can\\'t see a thing.\\nScuttle:\\nNothing is happening. . . . Only one day left, and that boy ain\\'t puckered up once. O.K. All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic stimulation. Stand back. [He flies over and sings very badly.]\\nEric:\\nWow. Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.\\nSebastian:\\nJeez, man, I\\'m surrounded by amateurs! You want something done, you\\'ve got to do it yourself. First, we got to create the mood. Percussion. . . . Strings. . . . Winds. . . . Words. . . .\\n[singing]\\nThere you see her\\nSitting there across the way\\nShe don\\'t got a lot to say\\nBut there\\'s something about her\\nAnd you don\\'t know why\\nBut you\\'re dying to try\\nYou wanna kiss the girl\\nEric:\\nDid you hear something?\\nSebastian: (singing)\\nYes, you want her\\nLook at her, you know you do\\nPossible she wants you too\\nThere is one way to ask her\\nIt don\\'t take a word\\nNot a single word\\nGo on and kiss the girl\\nSha la la la la la\\nMy oh my\\nLook like the boy too shy\\nAin\\'t gonna kiss the girl\\nSha la la la la la\\nAin\\'t that sad?\\nAin\\'t it a shame?\\nToo bad, he gonna miss the girl\\nEric:\\nYou know, I feel really bad not knowing your name. Heh - maybe I could guess. Is it, err, Mildred? O.K., no. How \\'bout - Diana? Rachel?\\nSebastian:\\nAriel. Her name is Ariel.\\nEric:\\nAriel? Ariel? Well, that\\'s kinda pretty. O.K. - Ariel. . .\\nSebastian: (singing)\\nNow\\'s your moment\\nFloating in a blue lagoon\\nBoy you better do it soon\\nNo time will be better\\nShe don\\'t say a word\\nAnd she won\\'t say a word\\nUntil you kiss the girl\\nSha la la la la la\\nDon\\'t be scared\\nYou got the mood prepared\\nGo on and kiss the girl\\nSha la la la la la\\nDon\\'t stop now\\nDon\\'t try to hide it how\\nYou want to kiss the girl\\nSha la la la la la\\nFloat along\\nAnd listen to the song\\nThe song say kiss the girl\\nSha la la la la\\nThe music play\\nDo what the music say\\nYou got to kiss the girl\\nYou\\'ve got to kiss the girl\\nYou wanna kiss the girl\\nYou\\'ve gotta kiss the girl\\nGo on and kiss the girl\\nThe boat tips over.\\nEric:\\nWhoa, hang on - I\\'ve gotcha. [Flotsam and Jetsam congradulate each other.]\\nCut to Ursula\\'s cavern.\\nUrsula:\\nNice work, boys. That was a close one. Too close. The little tramp! Oh, she\\'s better than I thought. At this rate, he\\'ll be kissing her by sunset for sure. Well, it\\'s time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles! Triton\\'s daughter will be mine - and then I\\'ll make him writhe. I\\'ll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook! [Laughing, she transforms into a human with Ariel\\'s voice.]\\nFade to castle at night. Eric is playing the flute and contemplating as Grimsby approaches.\\nGrimsby:\\nEric, if I may say, far better than any dream girl, is one of flesh and blood, one warm and caring, and right before your eyes. [He sees Ariel, sighs, and tosses away flute. He is distracted by Ursula/Vanessa singing with Ariel\\'s voice and is placed under her spell.]\\nScuttle flying toward castle in morning.\\nScuttle:\\nAriel! Ariel, wake up! Wake up! I just heard the news. Congratulations, kiddo, we did it!\\nSebastian:\\nWhat is this idiot babbling about?\\nScuttle:\\nRight - as if you two didn\\'t know, uh? The whole town\\'s buzzin\\' about the prince gettin\\' himself hitched this afternoon! You know, he\\'s getting married! You silly sidewalker! I just wanted to wish you luck. I\\'ll catch you later, I wouldn\\'t miss it! [Ariel brightens and runs downstairs, only to see Eric and Vanessa together.]\\nGrimsby:\\nWell, uh - err, Eric. I-it appears that I was mistaken. This mystery maiden of yours does - in fact exist. And - and she is lovely. Congratulations, my dear.\\nEric:\\nWe wish to be married as soon as possible.\\nGrimsby:\\nOh, yes - of course, Eric, but, er - but these things do take time, you know. . . .\\nEric:\\nThis afternoon, Grimsby. The wedding ship departs at sunset.\\nGrimsby:\\nOh, oh - very well, Eric - as you wish. [Ariel runs off crying.]\\nCut to late afternoon as wedding ship starts to leave. Ariel on pier crying bitterly as Sebastian and Flounder look on.\\nCut to Scuttle flying and humming to himself.\\nVanessa:\\nWhat a lovely little bride I\\'ll make, my dear I\\'ll look divine Things are working out according to my ultimate design Soon I\\'ll have that little mermaid and the ocean will be mine!\\nScuttle:\\n[Seeing real Ursula in mirror.] The sea witch!

I was flying, I wa - of course I was flying - An\\' - I s- I saw that the watch - the witch was watchin\\' a mirror, and she was singin\\' with a stolen set o\\' pipes! Do you hear what I\\'m tellin\\' you? THE PRINCE IS MARRYING THE SEA WITCH IN DISGUISE!\\nSebastian:\\nAre you sure about this?\\nScuttle:\\nHave I ever been wrong? I mean when it\\'s important!\\nFlounder:\\nWhat are we gonna do!? [Ariel hears Ursula\\'s voice in her head as the sun drops.]\\nUrsula:\\n. . . Before the sun sets on the third day. . . . [Ariel jumps in water but can\\'t swim well. Sebastian sends down some barrels.]\\nSebastian:\\nAriel, grab on to that. Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as your fins can carry you!\\nFlounder:\\nI\\'ll try.\\nSebastian:\\nI\\'ve gotta get to the sea king.

I didn\\'t know -\\nTriton attacks the contract with a fierce blast from his trident, to no avail.\\nUrsula:\\nYou see? The contract\\'s legal, binding and completely unbreakable - even for YOU. Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain. The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity. But - I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better. . . .\\nCut to Eric rowing away from ship.\\nGrimsby:\\nEric! What are you doing?\\nEric:\\nGrim, I lost her once. I\\'m not going to lose her again.\\nBack to Ursula and Triton.\\nUrsula:\\nNow! Do we have a deal? [Triton signs contract.] Ha! It\\'s done then.\\nAriel is released and Triton is withered as Ursula laughs.\\nAriel:\\nNo . . .

The waves obey my every whim! The sea and all its spoils bow to my power! [She wrecks havoc, creates a whirlpool and raises some shipwrecks.]\\nAriel:\\nERIC! [He gets on board one of the ships as Ariel falls to the bottom of the whirlpool. Ursula attempts to blast her.]\\nUrsula:\\n[Laughing wickedly.] So much for true love!

The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more\\nhappiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.\\n\\nYet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be\\nclassed as “historical” in the children’s library; for the time has\\ncome for a series of newer “wonder tales” in which the stereotyped\\ngenie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible\\nand blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a\\nfearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality;\\ntherefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales\\nand gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.\\n\\nHaving this thought in mind, the story of “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”\\nwas written solely to please children of today. It aspires to being a\\nmodernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and\\nthe heartaches and nightmares are left out.\\n\\nL. Frank Baum\\nChicago, April, 1900.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter I\\nThe Cyclone\\n\\n\\nDorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle\\nHenry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their\\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\\nmany miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry\\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\\nanother corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a\\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\\ncrush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the\\nmiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\\nhole.\\n\\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\\n\\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun\\nand wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes\\nand left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and\\nlips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled\\nnow. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had\\nbeen so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and\\npress her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy’s merry voice reached\\nher ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she\\ncould find anything to laugh at.\\n\\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and\\ndid not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his\\nrough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\\n\\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray\\nas her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black\\ndog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on\\neither side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and\\nDorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\\n\\nToday, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the\\ndoorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than\\nusual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at\\nthe sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.\\n\\nFrom the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry\\nand Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the\\ncoming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the\\nsouth, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the\\ngrass coming from that direction also.\\n\\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\\n\\n“There’s a cyclone coming, Em,” he called to his wife. “I’ll go look\\nafter the stock.” Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and\\nhorses were kept.\\n\\nAunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of\\nthe danger close at hand.\\n\\n“Quick, Dorothy!” she screamed. “Run for the cellar!”\\n\\nToto jumped out of Dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed, and the girl\\nstarted to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door\\nin the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole.\\nDorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she\\nwas halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind,\\nand the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down\\nsuddenly upon the floor.\\n\\nThen a strange thing happened.\\n\\nThe house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the\\nair. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\\n\\nThe north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the\\nexact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is\\ngenerally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of\\nthe house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top\\nof the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles\\naway as easily as you could carry a feather.\\n\\nIt was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy\\nfound she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around,\\nand one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were\\nbeing rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.\\n\\nToto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there,\\nbarking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to\\nsee what would happen.\\n\\nOnce Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first\\nthe little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his\\nears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air\\nwas keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole,\\ncaught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward\\nclosing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.\\n\\nHour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;\\nbut she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about\\nher that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would\\nbe dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed\\nand nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to\\nwait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled\\nover the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto\\nfollowed and lay down beside her.\\n\\nIn spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,\\nDorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter II\\nThe Council with the Munchkins\\n\\n\\nShe was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had\\nnot been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the\\njar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto\\nput his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat\\nup and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the\\nbright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She\\nsprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.\\n\\nThe little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes\\ngrowing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.\\n\\nThe cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the\\nmidst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of\\ngreensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious\\nfruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with\\nrare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.\\nA little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between\\ngreen banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl\\nwho had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.\\n\\nWhile she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,\\nshe noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had\\never seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been\\nused to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about\\nas tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although\\nthey were, so far as looks go, many years older.\\n\\nThree were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore\\nround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with\\nlittle bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The\\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman’s hat was white, and she\\nwore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were\\nsprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men\\nwere dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore\\nwell-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,\\nDorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had\\nbeards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was\\ncovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather\\nstiffly.\\n\\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the\\ndoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to\\ncome farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low\\nbow and said, in a sweet voice:\\n\\n“You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.\\nWe are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the\\nEast, and for setting our people free from bondage.”\\n\\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little\\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had\\nkilled the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless\\nlittle girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;\\nand she had never killed anything in all her life.\\n\\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,\\nwith hesitation, “You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I\\nhave not killed anything.”\\n\\n“Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with a laugh,\\n“and that is the same thing. See!” she continued, pointing to the\\ncorner of the house. “There are her two feet, still sticking out from\\nunder a block of wood.”\\n\\nDorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just\\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\\n\\n“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\\ndismay. “The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?”\\n\\n“There is nothing to be done,” said the little woman calmly.\\n\\n“But who was she?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,” answered the little\\nwoman. “She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,\\nmaking them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and\\nare grateful to you for the favor.”\\n\\n“Who are the Munchkins?” inquired Dorothy.\\n\\n“They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked\\nWitch ruled.”\\n\\n“Are you a Munchkin?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.\\nWhen they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\\nmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.”\\n\\n“Oh, gracious!” cried Dorothy. “Are you a real witch?”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” answered the little woman. “But I am a good witch, and\\nthe people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who\\nruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.”\\n\\n“But I thought all witches were wicked,” said the girl, who was half\\nfrightened at facing a real witch. “Oh, no, that is a great mistake.\\nThere were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,\\nthose who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know\\nthis is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.\\nThose who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;\\nbut now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch\\nin all the Land of Oz—the one who lives in the West.”\\n\\n“But,” said Dorothy, after a moment’s thought, “Aunt Em has told me\\nthat the witches were all dead—years and years ago.”\\n\\n“Who is Aunt Em?” inquired the little old woman.\\n\\n“She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.”\\n\\nThe Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed\\nand her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, “I do not\\nknow where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned\\nbefore. But tell me, is it a civilized country?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” replied Dorothy.\\n\\n“Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there\\nare no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But,\\nyou see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off\\nfrom all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and\\nwizards amongst us.”\\n\\n“Who are the wizards?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“Oz himself is the Great Wizard,” answered the Witch, sinking her voice\\nto a whisper. “He is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He\\nlives in the City of Emeralds.”\\n\\nDorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,\\nwho had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the\\ncorner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.\\n\\n“What is it?” asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to\\nlaugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing\\nwas left but the silver shoes.\\n\\n“She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that she dried up\\nquickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are\\nyours, and you shall have them to wear.” She reached down and picked up\\nthe shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to\\nDorothy.\\n\\n“The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,” said one of\\nthe Munchkins, “and there is some charm connected with them; but what\\nit is we never knew.”\\n\\nDorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table.\\nThen she came out again to the Munchkins and said:\\n\\n“I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will\\nworry about me. Can you help me find my way?”\\n\\nThe Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at\\nDorothy, and then shook their heads.\\n\\n“At the East, not far from here,” said one, “there is a great desert,\\nand none could live to cross it.”\\n\\n“It is the same at the South,” said another, “for I have been there and\\nseen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.”\\n\\n“I am told,” said the third man, “that it is the same at the West. And\\nthat country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of\\nthe West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.”\\n\\n“The North is my home,” said the old lady, “and at its edge is the same\\ngreat desert that surrounds this Land of Oz. I’m afraid, my dear, you\\nwill have to live with us.”\\n\\nDorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these\\nstrange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins,\\nfor they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep\\nalso. As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced\\nthe point on the end of her nose, while she counted “One, two, three”\\nin a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was\\nwritten in big, white chalk marks:\\n\\n“LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS”\\n\\n\\nThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the\\nwords on it, asked, “Is your name Dorothy, my dear?”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.\\n\\n“Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.”\\n\\n“Where is this city?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the\\nGreat Wizard I told you of.”\\n\\n“Is he a good man?” inquired the girl anxiously.\\n\\n“He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I\\nhave never seen him.”\\n\\n“How can I get there?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is\\nsometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use\\nall the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.”\\n\\n“Won’t you go with me?” pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon\\nthe little old woman as her only friend.\\n\\n“No, I cannot do that,” she replied, “but I will give you my kiss, and\\nno one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of\\nthe North.”\\n\\nShe came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where\\nher lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy\\nfound out soon after.\\n\\n“The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,” said the\\nWitch, “so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of\\nhim, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.”\\n\\nThe three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,\\nafter which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy\\na friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and\\nstraightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who\\nbarked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been\\nafraid even to growl while she stood by.\\n\\nBut Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear\\nin just that way, and was not surprised in the least.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter III\\nHow Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow\\n\\n\\nWhen Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went to\\nthe cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter.\\nShe gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it\\ndown to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.\\nToto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting\\nthere. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging\\nfrom the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what\\nshe wanted to help out her breakfast.\\n\\nThen she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to\\na good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for\\nthe journey to the City of Emeralds.\\n\\nDorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was\\nhanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white\\nand blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,\\nit was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed\\nherself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.\\nShe took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,\\nlaying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and\\nnoticed how old and worn her shoes were.\\n\\n“They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,” she said. And\\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his\\ntail to show he knew what she meant.\\n\\nAt that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had\\nbelonged to the Witch of the East.\\n\\n“I wonder if they will fit me,” she said to Toto. “They would be just\\nthe thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.”\\n\\nShe took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which\\nfitted her as well as if they had been made for her.\\n\\nFinally she picked up her basket.\\n\\n“Come along, Toto,” she said. “We will go to the Emerald City and ask\\nthe Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.”\\n\\nShe closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket\\nof her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she\\nstarted on her journey.\\n\\nThere were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find\\nthe one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking\\nbriskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on\\nthe hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang\\nsweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a\\nlittle girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own\\ncountry and set down in the midst of a strange land.\\n\\nShe was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country\\nwas about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted\\na dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and\\nvegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and\\nable to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and\\nthe people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for\\neveryone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and\\nsetting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were\\nodd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.\\nAll were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the\\nfavorite color.\\n\\nToward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to\\nwonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather\\nlarger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women\\nwere dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and\\nthe people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was\\nloaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other\\ngood things to eat.\\n\\nThe people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to\\npass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest\\nMunchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to\\ncelebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.\\n\\nDorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin\\nhimself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the\\npeople dance.\\n\\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said, “You must be a great sorceress.”\\n\\n“Why?” asked the girl.\\n\\n“Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.\\nBesides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses\\nwear white.”\\n\\n“My dress is blue and white checked,” said Dorothy, smoothing out the\\nwrinkles in it.\\n\\n“It is kind of you to wear that,” said Boq. “Blue is the color of the\\nMunchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly\\nwitch.”\\n\\nDorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to\\nthink her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary\\nlittle girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange\\nland.\\n\\nWhen she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,\\nwhere he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made\\nof blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with\\nToto curled up on the blue rug beside her.\\n\\nShe ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played\\nwith Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that\\ngreatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people,\\nfor they had never seen a dog before.\\n\\n“How far is it to the Emerald City?” the girl asked.\\n\\n“I do not know,” answered Boq gravely, “for I have never been there. It\\nis better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business\\nwith him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take\\nyou many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass\\nthrough rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your\\njourney.”\\n\\nThis worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz\\ncould help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn\\nback.\\n\\nShe bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of\\nyellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would\\nstop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road\\nand sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far\\naway she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from\\nthe ripe corn.\\n\\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the\\nScarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,\\nnose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue\\nhat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and\\nthe rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,\\nwhich had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots\\nwith blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure\\nwas raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its\\nback.\\n\\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the\\nScarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.\\nShe thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the\\nscarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its\\nhead to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and\\nwalked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.\\n\\n“Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\\n\\n“Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder.\\n\\n“Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow. “How do you do?”\\n\\n“I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely. “How do you\\ndo?”\\n\\n“I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is\\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.”\\n\\n“Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away\\nthe pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.”\\n\\nDorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,\\nbeing stuffed with straw, it was quite light.\\n\\n“Thank you very much,” said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on\\nthe ground. “I feel like a new man.”\\n\\nDorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man\\nspeak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.\\n\\n“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and\\nyawned. “And where are you going?”\\n\\n“My name is Dorothy,” said the girl, “and I am going to the Emerald\\nCity, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.”\\n\\n“Where is the Emerald City?” he inquired. “And who is Oz?”\\n\\n“Why, don’t you know?” she returned, in surprise.\\n\\n“No, indeed. I don’t know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no\\nbrains at all,” he answered sadly.\\n\\n“Oh,” said Dorothy, “I’m awfully sorry for you.”\\n\\n“Do you think,” he asked, “if I go to the Emerald City with you, that\\nOz would give me some brains?”\\n\\n“I cannot tell,” she returned, “but you may come with me, if you like.\\nIf Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you\\nare now.”\\n\\n“That is true,” said the Scarecrow. “You see,” he continued\\nconfidentially, “I don’t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,\\nbecause I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin\\ninto me, it doesn’t matter, for I can’t feel it. But I do not want\\npeople to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw\\ninstead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?”\\n\\n“I understand how you feel,” said the little girl, who was truly sorry\\nfor him. “If you will come with me I’ll ask Oz to do all he can for\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” he answered gratefully.\\n\\nThey walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and\\nthey started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.\\n\\nToto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled\\naround the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats\\nin the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the\\nScarecrow.\\n\\n“Don’t mind Toto,” said Dorothy to her new friend. “He never bites.”\\n\\n“Oh, I’m not afraid,” replied the Scarecrow. “He can’t hurt the straw.\\nDo let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can’t\\nget tired. I’ll tell you a secret,” he continued, as he walked along.\\n“There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.”\\n\\n“What is that?” asked Dorothy; “the Munchkin farmer who made you?”\\n\\n“No,” answered the Scarecrow; “it’s a lighted match.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IV\\nThe Road Through the Forest\\n\\n\\nAfter a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so\\ndifficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks,\\nwhich were here very uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or\\nmissing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy\\nwalked around. As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he walked\\nstraight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length\\non the hard bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick\\nhim up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing\\nmerrily at his own mishap.\\n\\nThe farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther\\nback. There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther\\nthey went the more dismal and lonesome the country became.\\n\\nAt noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy\\nopened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece to the\\nScarecrow, but he refused.\\n\\n“I am never hungry,” he said, “and it is a lucky thing I am not, for my\\nmouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat,\\nthe straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the\\nshape of my head.”\\n\\nDorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on\\neating her bread.\\n\\n“Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,” said\\nthe Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So she told him all\\nabout Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone\\nhad carried her to this queer Land of Oz.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, “I cannot understand why\\nyou should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry,\\ngray place you call Kansas.”\\n\\n“That is because you have no brains” answered the girl. “No matter how\\ndreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would\\nrather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful.\\nThere is no place like home.”\\n\\nThe Scarecrow sighed.\\n\\n“Of course I cannot understand it,” he said. “If your heads were\\nstuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the\\nbeautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is\\nfortunate for Kansas that you have brains.”\\n\\n“Won’t you tell me a story, while we are resting?” asked the child.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:\\n\\n“My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was\\nonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that\\ntime is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one\\nof the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what\\nwas going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing\\nI heard was the farmer saying, ‘How do you like those ears?’\\n\\n“‘They aren’t straight,’” answered the other.\\n\\n“‘Never mind,’” said the farmer. “‘They are ears just the same,’” which\\nwas true enough.\\n\\n“‘Now I’ll make the eyes,’” said the farmer. So he painted my right\\neye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and\\nat everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my\\nfirst glimpse of the world.\\n\\n“‘That’s a rather pretty eye,’” remarked the Munchkin who was watching\\nthe farmer. “‘Blue paint is just the color for eyes.’\\n\\n“‘I think I’ll make the other a little bigger,’” said the farmer. And\\nwhen the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then\\nhe made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time\\nI didn’t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make\\nmy body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at\\nlast, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as\\nanyone.\\n\\n“‘This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,’ said the farmer. ‘He\\nlooks just like a man.’\\n\\n“‘Why, he is a man,’ said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The\\nfarmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\\ntall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked\\naway and left me alone.\\n\\n“I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.\\nBut my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on\\nthat pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,\\nhaving been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds\\nflew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away\\nagain, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel\\nthat I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near\\nme, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“‘I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any\\ncrow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.’ Then he\\nhopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,\\nseeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short\\ntime there was a great flock of them about me.\\n\\n“I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow\\nafter all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, ‘If you only had\\nbrains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a\\nbetter man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having\\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.’\\n\\n“After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\\nhard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off\\nthe stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me\\nbrains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.”\\n\\n“I hope so,” said Dorothy earnestly, “since you seem anxious to have\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; I am anxious,” returned the Scarecrow. “It is such an\\nuncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the girl, “let us go.” And she handed the basket to the\\nScarecrow.\\n\\nThere were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough\\nand untilled. Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the\\ntrees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the\\nroad of yellow brick. It was almost dark under the trees, for the\\nbranches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and\\nwent on into the forest.\\n\\n“If this road goes in, it must come out,” said the Scarecrow, “and as\\nthe Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever\\nit leads us.”\\n\\n“Anyone would know that,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Certainly; that is why I know it,” returned the Scarecrow. “If it\\nrequired brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.”\\n\\nAfter an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves\\nstumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto\\ncould, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow\\ndeclared he could see as well as by day. So she took hold of his arm\\nand managed to get along fairly well.\\n\\n“If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,” she\\nsaid, “you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the\\ndark.”\\n\\nSoon after the Scarecrow stopped.\\n\\n“I see a little cottage at the right of us,” he said, “built of logs\\nand branches. Shall we go there?”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” answered the child. “I am all tired out.”\\n\\nSo the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the\\ncottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one\\ncorner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a\\nsound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another\\ncorner and waited patiently until morning came.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter V\\nThe Rescue of the Tin Woodman\\n\\n\\nWhen Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had\\nlong been out chasing birds around him and squirrels. She sat up and\\nlooked around her. There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in\\nhis corner, waiting for her.\\n\\n“We must go and search for water,” she said to him.\\n\\n“Why do you want water?” he asked.\\n\\n“To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the\\ndry bread will not stick in my throat.”\\n\\n“It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,” said the Scarecrow\\nthoughtfully, “for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have\\nbrains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly.”\\n\\nThey left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a\\nlittle spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate\\nher breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and\\nthe girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for\\nthere was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.\\n\\nWhen she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of\\nyellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.\\n\\n“What was that?” she asked timidly.\\n\\n“I cannot imagine,” replied the Scarecrow; “but we can go and see.”\\n\\nJust then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to\\ncome from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few\\nsteps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine\\nthat fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped\\nshort, with a little cry of surprise.\\n\\nOne of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing\\nbeside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely\\nof tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he\\nstood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.\\n\\nDorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while\\nToto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his\\nteeth.\\n\\n“Did you groan?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“Yes,” answered the tin man, “I did. I’ve been groaning for more than a\\nyear, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.”\\n\\n“What can I do for you?” she inquired softly, for she was moved by the\\nsad voice in which the man spoke.\\n\\n“Get an oil-can and oil my joints,” he answered. “They are rusted so\\nbadly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon\\nbe all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.”\\n\\nDorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then\\nshe returned and asked anxiously, “Where are your joints?”\\n\\n“Oil my neck, first,” replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as\\nit was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and\\nmoved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the\\nman could turn it himself.\\n\\n“Now oil the joints in my arms,” he said. And Dorothy oiled them and\\nthe Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust\\nand as good as new.\\n\\nThe Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which\\nhe leaned against the tree.\\n\\n“This is a great comfort,” he said. “I have been holding that axe in\\nthe air ever since I rusted, and I’m glad to be able to put it down at\\nlast. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right\\nonce more.”\\n\\nSo they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked\\nthem again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite\\ncreature, and very grateful.\\n\\n“I might have stood there always if you had not come along,” he said;\\n“so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?”\\n\\n“We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,” she\\nanswered, “and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.”\\n\\n“Why do you wish to see Oz?” he asked.\\n\\n“I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to\\nput a few brains into his head,” she replied.\\n\\nThe Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:\\n\\n“Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?”\\n\\n“Why, I guess so,” Dorothy answered. “It would be as easy as to give\\nthe Scarecrow brains.”\\n\\n“True,” the Tin Woodman returned. “So, if you will allow me to join\\nyour party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.”\\n\\n“Come along,” said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she\\nwould be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his\\naxe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road\\nthat was paved with yellow brick.\\n\\nThe Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.\\n“For,” he said, “if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I\\nwould need the oil-can badly.”\\n\\nIt was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for\\nsoon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place\\nwhere the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the\\ntravelers could not pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe\\nand chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire\\nparty.\\n\\nDorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not\\nnotice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the\\nside of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up\\nagain.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you walk around the hole?” asked the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“I don’t know enough,” replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. “My head is\\nstuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask\\nhim for some brains.”\\n\\n“Oh, I see,” said the Tin Woodman. “But, after all, brains are not the\\nbest things in the world.”\\n\\n“Have you any?” inquired the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“No, my head is quite empty,” answered the Woodman. “But once I had\\nbrains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\\nrather have a heart.”\\n\\n“And why is that?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I will tell you my story, and then you will know.”\\n\\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\\nthe following story:\\n\\n“I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest\\nand sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a\\nwoodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as\\nlong as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone\\nI would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\\n\\n“There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon\\ngrew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry\\nme as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for\\nher; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old\\nwoman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she\\nwished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the\\nhousework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and\\npromised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.\\nThereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping\\naway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my\\nwife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my\\nleft leg.\\n\\n“This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and\\nhad him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I\\nwas used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for\\nshe had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin\\ngirl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right\\nleg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of\\ntin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;\\nbut, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked\\nWitch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I\\nthought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come\\nalong, and he made me a new head out of tin.\\n\\n“I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a\\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into\\ntwo halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body\\nof tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had\\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\\nnot care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living\\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\\n\\n“My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and\\nit did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There\\nwas only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in\\nmy cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,\\nthere came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a\\nrainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I\\nwas left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a\\nterrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time\\nto think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.\\nWhile I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can\\nlove who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me\\none. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”\\n\\nBoth Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story\\nof the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a\\nnew heart.\\n\\n“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “I shall ask for brains instead of\\na heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had\\none.”\\n\\n“I shall take the heart,” returned the Tin Woodman; “for brains do not\\nmake one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.”\\n\\nDorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her\\ntwo friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to\\nKansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had\\nno brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.\\n\\nWhat worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another\\nmeal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure, neither\\nthe Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made\\nof tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VI\\nThe Cowardly Lion\\n\\n\\nAll this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the\\nthick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were\\nmuch covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the\\nwalking was not at all good.\\n\\nThere were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the\\nopen country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there\\ncame a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These\\nsounds made the little girl’s heart beat fast, for she did not know\\nwhat made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy’s side,\\nand did not even bark in return.\\n\\n“How long will it be,” the child asked of the Tin Woodman, “before we\\nare out of the forest?”\\n\\n“I cannot tell,” was the answer, “for I have never been to the Emerald\\nCity. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it\\nwas a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the\\ncity where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so\\nlong as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while\\nyou bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch’s kiss, and that\\nwill protect you from harm.”\\n\\n“But Toto!” said the girl anxiously. “What will protect him?”\\n\\n“We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,” replied the Tin\\nWoodman.\\n\\nJust as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the\\nnext moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his\\npaw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the\\nroad, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But,\\nto the Lion’s surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,\\nalthough the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.\\n\\nLittle Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the\\nLion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when\\nDorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed\\nforward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while\\nshe cried out:\\n\\n“Don’t you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a\\nbig beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!”\\n\\n“I didn’t bite him,” said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw\\nwhere Dorothy had hit it.\\n\\n“No, but you tried to,” she retorted. “You are nothing but a big\\ncoward.”\\n\\n“I know it,” said the Lion, hanging his head in shame. “I’ve always\\nknown it. But how can I help it?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, I’m sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like\\nthe poor Scarecrow!”\\n\\n“Is he stuffed?” asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up\\nthe Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into\\nshape again.\\n\\n“Of course he’s stuffed,” replied Dorothy, who was still angry.\\n\\n“That’s why he went over so easily,” remarked the Lion. “It astonished\\nme to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?”\\n\\n“No,” said Dorothy, “he’s made of tin.” And she helped the Woodman up\\nagain.\\n\\n“That’s why he nearly blunted my claws,” said the Lion. “When they\\nscratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What\\nis that little animal you are so tender of?”\\n\\n“He is my dog, Toto,” answered Dorothy.\\n\\n“Is he made of tin, or stuffed?” asked the Lion.\\n\\n“Neither. He’s a—a—a meat dog,” said the girl.\\n\\n“Oh! He’s a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look\\nat him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a\\ncoward like me,” continued the Lion sadly.\\n\\n“What makes you a coward?” asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in\\nwonder, for he was as big as a small horse.\\n\\n“It’s a mystery,” replied the Lion. “I suppose I was born that way. All\\nthe other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for\\nthe Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that\\nif I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out\\nof my way. Whenever I’ve met a man I’ve been awfully scared; but I just\\nroared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If\\nthe elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me,\\nI should have run myself—I’m such a coward; but just as soon as they\\nhear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them\\ngo.”\\n\\n“But that isn’t right. The King of Beasts shouldn’t be a coward,” said\\nthe Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I know it,” returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip\\nof his tail. “It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy.\\nBut whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you have heart disease,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“It may be,” said the Lion.\\n\\n“If you have,” continued the Tin Woodman, “you ought to be glad, for it\\nproves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have\\nheart disease.”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” said the Lion thoughtfully, “if I had no heart I should not\\nbe a coward.”\\n\\n“Have you brains?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I suppose so. I’ve never looked to see,” replied the Lion.\\n\\n“I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,” remarked the\\nScarecrow, “for my head is stuffed with straw.”\\n\\n“And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,” said the Woodman.\\n\\n“And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,” added\\nDorothy.\\n\\n“Do you think Oz could give me courage?” asked the Cowardly Lion.\\n\\n“Just as easily as he could give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Or give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“Or send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Then, if you don’t mind, I’ll go with you,” said the Lion, “for my\\nlife is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.”\\n\\n“You will be very welcome,” answered Dorothy, “for you will help to\\nkeep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more\\ncowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.”\\n\\n“They really are,” said the Lion, “but that doesn’t make me any braver,\\nand as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.”\\n\\nSo once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion\\nwalking with stately strides at Dorothy’s side. Toto did not approve of\\nthis new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had\\nbeen crushed between the Lion’s great jaws. But after a time he became\\nmore at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be\\ngood friends.\\n\\nDuring the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the\\npeace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a\\nbeetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little\\nthing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always\\ncareful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept\\nseveral tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his\\nface and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When\\nDorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open\\nhis mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly\\nfrightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but\\nshe could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was\\nwrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy’s basket and\\noiled the Woodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as\\nwell as before.\\n\\n“This will serve me a lesson,” said he, “to look where I step. For if I\\nshould kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying\\nrusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.”\\n\\nThereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and\\nwhen he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to\\nharm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore\\nhe took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.\\n\\n“You people with hearts,” he said, “have something to guide you, and\\nneed never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very\\ncareful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn’t mind so much.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VII\\nThe Journey to the Great Oz\\n\\n\\nThey were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the\\nforest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick\\ncovering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a\\ngreat pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that\\nwarmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of\\ntheir bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.\\n\\n“If you wish,” said the Lion, “I will go into the forest and kill a\\ndeer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so\\npeculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very\\ngood breakfast.”\\n\\n“Don’t! Please don’t,” begged the Tin Woodman. “I should certainly weep\\nif you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.”\\n\\nBut the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no\\none ever knew what it was, for he didn’t mention it. And the Scarecrow\\nfound a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy’s basket with them, so\\nthat she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very\\nkind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the\\nawkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded\\nhands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost\\nas many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how\\nlong it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away\\nfrom the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn\\nhim up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came\\nnear to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These\\nkept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.\\n\\nWhen it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling\\nbrook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.\\n\\nThis was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been\\nwalking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed\\nthe road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either\\nside. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and\\nlooked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were\\nmany big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none\\nof them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey\\nmust end.\\n\\n“What shall we do?” asked Dorothy despairingly.\\n\\n“I haven’t the faintest idea,” said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook\\nhis shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.\\n\\nBut the Scarecrow said, “We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we\\nclimb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it,\\nwe must stop where we are.”\\n\\n“I think I could jump over it,” said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring\\nthe distance carefully in his mind.\\n\\n“Then we are all right,” answered the Scarecrow, “for you can carry us\\nall over on your back, one at a time.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll try it,” said the Lion. “Who will go first?”\\n\\n“I will,” declared the Scarecrow, “for, if you found that you could not\\njump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly\\ndented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter\\nso much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.”\\n\\n“I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,” said the Cowardly Lion, “but\\nI suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we\\nwill make the attempt.”\\n\\nThe Scarecrow sat upon the Lion’s back, and the big beast walked to the\\nedge of the gulf and crouched down.\\n\\n“Why don’t you run and jump?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Because that isn’t the way we Lions do these things,” he replied. Then\\ngiving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the\\nother side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it,\\nand after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang\\nacross the ditch again.\\n\\nDorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and\\nclimbed on the Lion’s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.\\nThe next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and\\nthen, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other\\nside. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then\\nthey all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest,\\nfor his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big\\ndog that has been running too long.\\n\\nThey found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and\\ngloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow\\nbrick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would\\ncome to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To\\nadd to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths\\nof the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part\\nof the country that the Kalidahs lived.\\n\\n“What are the Kalidahs?” asked the girl.\\n\\n“They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\\ntigers,” replied the Lion, “and with claws so long and sharp that they\\ncould tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I’m terribly\\nafraid of the Kalidahs.”\\n\\n“I’m not surprised that you are,” returned Dorothy. “They must be\\ndreadful beasts.”\\n\\nThe Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf\\nacross the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew\\nat once he could not leap across it.\\n\\nSo they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious\\nthought the Scarecrow said:\\n\\n“Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman\\ncan chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk\\nacross it easily.”\\n\\n“That is a first-rate idea,” said the Lion. “One would almost suspect\\nyou had brains in your head, instead of straw.”\\n\\nThe Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree\\nwas soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front\\nlegs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big\\ntree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top\\nbranches on the other side.\\n\\nThey had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl\\nmade them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them\\ntwo great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.\\n\\n“They are the Kalidahs!” said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.\\n\\n“Quick!” cried the Scarecrow. “Let us cross over.”\\n\\nSo Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman\\nfollowed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was\\ncertainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud\\nand terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over\\nbackward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him\\nin surprise.\\n\\nBut, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there\\nwere two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed\\nforward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they\\nwould do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began\\nto cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:\\n\\n“We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp\\nclaws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am\\nalive.”\\n\\n“Wait a minute!” called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was\\nbest to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of\\nthe tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began\\nto use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly\\nacross, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,\\nsnarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp\\nrocks at the bottom.\\n\\n“Well,” said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, “I see\\nwe are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it\\nmust be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creatures\\nfrightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.”\\n\\n“Ah,” said the Tin Woodman sadly, “I wish I had a heart to beat.”\\n\\nThis adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of\\nthe forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had\\nto ride on the Lion’s back. To their great joy the trees became thinner\\nthe farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon\\na broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of\\nthe water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a\\nbeautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and\\nall the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They\\nwere greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.\\n\\n“How shall we cross the river?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“That is easily done,” replied the Scarecrow. “The Tin Woodman must\\nbuild us a raft, so we can float to the other side.”\\n\\nSo the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make\\na raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the\\nriverbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had\\neaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe\\nfruit.\\n\\nBut it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and\\nuntiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.\\nSo they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until\\nthe morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good\\nWizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VIII\\nThe Deadly Poppy Field\\n\\n\\nOur little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and\\nfull of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and\\nplums from the trees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest\\nthey had passed safely through, although they had suffered many\\ndiscouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that\\nseemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.\\n\\nTo be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.\\nBut the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few\\nmore logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready\\nto start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in\\nher arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly,\\nfor he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood\\nupon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands\\nto push the raft through the water.\\n\\nThey got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of\\nthe river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and\\nfarther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep\\nthat the long poles would not touch the bottom.\\n\\n“This is bad,” said the Tin Woodman, “for if we cannot get to the land\\nwe shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,\\nand she will enchant us and make us her slaves.”\\n\\n“And then I should get no brains,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“And I should get no courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.\\n\\n“And I should get no heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“And I should never get back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,” the Scarecrow\\ncontinued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in\\nthe mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out\\nagain—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was\\nleft clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.\\n\\n“Good-bye!” he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave\\nhim. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered\\nthat he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy’s apron.\\n\\nOf course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,” he thought. “Then,\\nI was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare\\nthe crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow\\nstuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never\\nhave any brains, after all!”\\n\\nDown the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far\\nbehind. Then the Lion said:\\n\\n“Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and\\npull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my\\ntail.”\\n\\nSo he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of\\nhis tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the\\nshore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they\\nwere drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman’s\\nlong pole and helped push the raft to the land.\\n\\nThey were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped\\noff upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had\\ncarried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the\\nEmerald City.\\n\\n“What shall we do now?” asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on\\nthe grass to let the sun dry him.\\n\\n“We must get back to the road, in some way,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the\\nroad again,” remarked the Lion.\\n\\nSo, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they\\nstarted along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had\\ncarried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit\\ntrees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for\\nthe poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.\\n\\nThey walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to\\npick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:\\n“Look!”\\n\\nThen they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon\\nhis pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.\\n\\n“What can we do to save him?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\nThe Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.\\nSo they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow\\nuntil a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the\\nwater’s edge.\\n\\n“Who are you and where are you going?” asked the Stork.\\n\\n“I am Dorothy,” answered the girl, “and these are my friends, the Tin\\nWoodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.”\\n\\n“This isn’t the road,” said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and\\nlooked sharply at the queer party.\\n\\n“I know it,” returned Dorothy, “but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are\\nwondering how we shall get him again.”\\n\\n“Where is he?” asked the Stork.\\n\\n“Over there in the river,” answered the little girl.\\n\\n“If he wasn’t so big and heavy I would get him for you,” remarked the\\nStork.\\n\\n“He isn’t heavy a bit,” said Dorothy eagerly, “for he is stuffed with\\nstraw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever\\nand ever so much.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll try,” said the Stork, “but if I find he is too heavy to\\ncarry I shall have to drop him in the river again.”\\n\\nSo the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to\\nwhere the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her\\ngreat claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into\\nthe air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin\\nWoodman and Toto were sitting.\\n\\nWhen the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so\\nhappy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they\\nwalked along he sang “Tol-de-ri-de-oh!” at every step, he felt so gay.\\n\\n“I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,” he said,\\n“but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find\\nthe Stork again and do her some kindness in return.”\\n\\n“That’s all right,” said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.\\n“I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my\\nbabies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald\\nCity and that Oz will help you.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air\\nand was soon out of sight.\\n\\nThey walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored\\nbirds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that\\nthe ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and\\nblue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,\\nwhich were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy’s eyes.\\n\\n“Aren’t they beautiful?” the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy\\nscent of the bright flowers.\\n\\n“I suppose so,” answered the Scarecrow. “When I have brains, I shall\\nprobably like them better.”\\n\\n“If I only had a heart, I should love them,” added the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“I always did like flowers,” said the Lion. “They seem so helpless and\\nfrail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.”\\n\\nThey now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer\\nand fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the\\nmidst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when\\nthere are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that\\nanyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried\\naway from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But\\nDorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red\\nflowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy\\nand she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.\\n\\nBut the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.\\n\\n“We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,”\\nhe said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until\\nDorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and\\nshe forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.\\n\\n“What shall we do?” asked the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“If we leave her here she will die,” said the Lion. “The smell of the\\nflowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and\\nthe dog is asleep already.”\\n\\nIt was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not\\ntroubled by the scent of the flowers.\\n\\n“Run fast,” said the Scarecrow to the Lion, “and get out of this deadly\\nflower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us,\\nbut if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.”\\n\\nSo the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.\\nIn a moment he was out of sight.\\n\\n“Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,” said the Scarecrow.\\nSo they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy’s lap, and then they\\nmade a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms\\nand carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.\\n\\nOn and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly\\nflowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of\\nthe river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast\\nasleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge\\nbeast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance\\nfrom the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in\\nbeautiful green fields before them.\\n\\n“We can do nothing for him,” said the Tin Woodman, sadly; “for he is\\nmuch too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and\\nperhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry,” said the Scarecrow. “The Lion was a very good comrade for\\none so cowardly. But let us go on.”\\n\\nThey carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far\\nenough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the\\npoison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass\\nand waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IX\\nThe Queen of the Field Mice\\n\\n\\n“We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,” remarked the\\nScarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, “for we have come nearly as far\\nas the river carried us away.”\\n\\nThe Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and\\nturning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange\\nbeast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great\\nyellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something,\\nfor its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open,\\nshowing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of\\nfire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the\\nbeast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he\\nknew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,\\nharmless creature.\\n\\nSo the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a\\nquick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body, and it\\nrolled over at his feet in two pieces.\\n\\nThe field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;\\nand coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:\\n\\n“Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.”\\n\\n“Don’t speak of it, I beg of you,” replied the Woodman. “I have no\\nheart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a\\nfriend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.”\\n\\n“Only a mouse!” cried the little animal, indignantly. “Why, I am a\\nQueen—the Queen of all the Field Mice!”\\n\\n“Oh, indeed,” said the Woodman, making a bow.\\n\\n“Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in\\nsaving my life,” added the Queen.\\n\\nAt that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their\\nlittle legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n“Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage\\nto escape the great Wildcat?” They all bowed so low to the little Queen\\nthat they almost stood upon their heads.\\n\\n“This funny tin man,” she answered, “killed the Wildcat and saved my\\nlife. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest\\nwish.”\\n\\n“We will!” cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they\\nscampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and\\nseeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped\\nright into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice\\nwhen he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.\\n\\nBut the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,\\nwhile he called to the mice, “Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt\\nyou.”\\n\\nAt this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a\\nclump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, “Are you sure he will not\\nbite us?”\\n\\n“I will not let him,” said the Woodman; “so do not be afraid.”\\n\\nOne by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again,\\nalthough he tried to get out of the Woodman’s arms, and would have\\nbitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one\\nof the biggest mice spoke.\\n\\n“Is there anything we can do,” it asked, “to repay you for saving the\\nlife of our Queen?”\\n\\n“Nothing that I know of,” answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who\\nhad been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed\\nwith straw, said, quickly, “Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the\\nCowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.”\\n\\n“A Lion!” cried the little Queen. “Why, he would eat us all up.”\\n\\n“Oh, no,” declared the Scarecrow; “this Lion is a coward.”\\n\\n“Really?” asked the Mouse.\\n\\n“He says so himself,” answered the Scarecrow, “and he would never hurt\\nanyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promise\\nthat he shall treat you all with kindness.”\\n\\n“Very well,” said the Queen, “we trust you. But what shall we do?”\\n\\n“Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to\\nobey you?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; there are thousands,” she replied.\\n\\n“Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each\\none bring a long piece of string.”\\n\\nThe Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at\\nonce and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran\\naway in every direction as fast as possible.\\n\\n“Now,” said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, “you must go to those\\ntrees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.”\\n\\nSo the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon\\nmade a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all\\nthe leaves and branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and\\nmade the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast\\nand so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the\\ntruck was all ready for them.\\n\\nThey came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big\\nmice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a\\npiece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke\\nfrom her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to\\nfind herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing\\naround and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about\\neverything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:\\n\\n“Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.”\\n\\nDorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she\\nbecame quite friendly with the little girl.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the\\ntruck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied\\naround the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course\\nthe truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to\\ndraw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to\\npull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit\\non it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place\\nwhere the Lion lay asleep.\\n\\nAfter a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed\\nto get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people\\nthe order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies\\ntoo long they also would fall asleep.\\n\\nAt first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir\\nthe heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed\\nfrom behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out\\nof the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,\\nfresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.\\n\\nDorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving\\nher companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was\\nglad he had been rescued.\\n\\nThen the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away\\nthrough the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to\\nleave.\\n\\n“If ever you need us again,” she said, “come out into the field and\\ncall, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!”\\n\\n“Good-bye!” they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy\\nheld Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.\\n\\nAfter this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and\\nthe Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she\\nate for her dinner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter X\\nThe Guardian of the Gate\\n\\n\\nIt was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain\\namong the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;\\nbut when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad\\nto find himself still alive.\\n\\n“I ran as fast as I could,” he said, sitting down and yawning, “but the\\nflowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?”\\n\\nThen they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved\\nhim from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:\\n\\n“I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little\\nthings as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as\\nmice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what\\nshall we do now?”\\n\\n“We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,” said\\nDorothy, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.”\\n\\nSo, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,\\nthey all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through\\nthe soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road\\nof yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the\\nGreat Oz dwelt.\\n\\nThe road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was\\nbeautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far\\nbehind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades.\\nOnce more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were\\npainted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer\\nevidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of\\nthese houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the\\ndoors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no\\none came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of\\nwhich they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in\\nclothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like\\nthose of the Munchkins.\\n\\n“This must be the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy, “and we are surely getting\\nnear the Emerald City.”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered the Scarecrow. “Everything is green here, while in the\\ncountry of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do\\nnot seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I’m afraid we shall be\\nunable to find a place to pass the night.”\\n\\n“I should like something to eat besides fruit,” said the girl, “and I’m\\nsure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to\\nthe people.”\\n\\nSo, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up\\nto the door and knocked.\\n\\nA woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, “What do you\\nwant, child, and why is that great Lion with you?”\\n\\n“We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,” answered\\nDorothy; “and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you\\nfor the world.”\\n\\n“Is he tame?” asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” said the girl, “and he is a great coward, too. He will be\\nmore afraid of you than you are of him.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep\\nat the Lion, “if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you\\nsome supper and a place to sleep.”\\n\\nSo they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two\\nchildren and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the\\ncouch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a\\ncompany, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:\\n\\n“Where are you all going?”\\n\\n“To the Emerald City,” said Dorothy, “to see the Great Oz.”\\n\\n“Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the man. “Are you sure that Oz will see you?”\\n\\n“Why not?” she replied.\\n\\n“Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I\\nhave been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and\\nwonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,\\nnor do I know of any living person who has seen him.”\\n\\n“Does he never go out?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,\\nand even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.”\\n\\n“What is he like?” asked the girl.\\n\\n“That is hard to tell,” said the man thoughtfully. “You see, Oz is a\\nGreat Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he\\nlooks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say\\nhe looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a\\nbrownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is,\\nwhen he is in his own form, no living person can tell.”\\n\\n“That is very strange,” said Dorothy, “but we must try, in some way, to\\nsee him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.”\\n\\n“Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?” asked the man.\\n\\n“I want him to give me some brains,” said the Scarecrow eagerly.\\n\\n“Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,” declared the man. “He has more\\nbrains than he needs.”\\n\\n“And I want him to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“That will not trouble him,” continued the man, “for Oz has a large\\ncollection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.”\\n\\n“And I want him to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.\\n\\n“Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,” said the man,\\n“which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running\\nover. He will be glad to give you some.”\\n\\n“And I want him to send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Where is Kansas?” asked the man, with surprise.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” replied Dorothy sorrowfully, “but it is my home, and\\nI’m sure it’s somewhere.”\\n\\n“Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find\\nKansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a\\nhard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he\\nusually has his own way. But what do YOU want?” he continued, speaking\\nto Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not\\nspeak.\\n\\nThe woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered\\naround the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of\\nscrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal.\\nThe Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it\\nwas made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of\\neverything, and was glad to get a good supper again.\\n\\nThe woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside\\nher, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be\\ndisturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and\\nkept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.\\n\\nThe next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way,\\nand soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.\\n\\n“That must be the Emerald City,” said Dorothy.\\n\\nAs they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it\\nseemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it\\nwas afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the\\nCity. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.\\n\\nIn front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big\\ngate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even\\nthe painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.\\n\\nThere was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and\\nheard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly\\nopen, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched\\nroom, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.\\n\\nBefore them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He\\nwas clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin\\nwas of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.\\n\\nWhen he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, “What do you wish\\nin the Emerald City?”\\n\\n“We came here to see the Great Oz,” said Dorothy.\\n\\nThe man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it\\nover.\\n\\n“It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,” he said,\\nshaking his head in perplexity. “He is powerful and terrible, and if\\nyou come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of\\nthe Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.”\\n\\n“But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,” replied the\\nScarecrow; “it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good\\nWizard.”\\n\\n“So he is,” said the green man, “and he rules the Emerald City wisely\\nand well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from\\ncuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his\\nface. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the\\nGreat Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the\\nspectacles.”\\n\\n“Why?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the\\nEmerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear\\nspectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it\\nwhen the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock\\nthem.”\\n\\nHe opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with\\nspectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in\\nthem. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit\\nDorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands\\nfastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they\\nwere locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the\\nGuardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy\\ncould not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish\\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\\n\\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin\\nWoodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast\\nwith the key.\\n\\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he\\nwas ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a\\npeg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him\\nthrough the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XI\\nThe Wonderful City of Oz\\n\\n\\nEven with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her\\nfriends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City.\\nThe streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble\\nand studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a\\npavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined\\ntogether were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the\\nbrightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the\\nsky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were\\ngreen.\\n\\nThere were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and\\nthese were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They\\nlooked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering\\neyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when\\nthey saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the\\nstreet, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy\\nand green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green\\nhats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling\\ngreen lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that\\nthey paid for it with green pennies.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried\\nthings around in little green carts, which they pushed before them.\\nEveryone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.\\n\\nThe Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came\\nto a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the\\nPalace of Oz, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the door,\\ndressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.\\n\\n“Here are strangers,” said the Guardian of the Gates to him, “and they\\ndemand to see the Great Oz.”\\n\\n“Step inside,” answered the soldier, “and I will carry your message to\\nhim.”\\n\\nSo they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room\\nwith a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The\\nsoldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering\\nthis room, and when they were seated he said politely:\\n\\n“Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the\\nThrone Room and tell Oz you are here.”\\n\\nThey had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at\\nlast, he came back, Dorothy asked:\\n\\n“Have you seen Oz?”\\n\\n“Oh, no,” returned the soldier; “I have never seen him. But I spoke to\\nhim as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he\\nwill grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must\\nenter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day.\\nTherefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will\\nhave you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your\\njourney.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” replied the girl; “that is very kind of Oz.”\\n\\nThe soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,\\ndressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely\\ngreen hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she\\nsaid, “Follow me and I will show you your room.”\\n\\nSo Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the\\ndog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up\\nthree flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the\\nPalace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft\\ncomfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet\\ncounterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that\\nshot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a\\nbeautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in\\nthe windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.\\nWhen Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer\\ngreen pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.\\n\\nIn a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and\\nvelvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.\\n\\n“Make yourself perfectly at home,” said the green girl, “and if you\\nwish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow\\nmorning.”\\n\\nShe left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led\\nto rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant\\npart of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the\\nScarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood\\nstupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It\\nwould not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he\\nremained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web\\nin a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most\\nwonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from\\nforce of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not\\nbeing able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down\\nto make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have\\npreferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being\\nshut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so\\nhe sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred\\nhimself asleep in a minute.\\n\\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of\\ngreen brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\\ngreen ribbon around Toto’s neck, and they started for the Throne Room\\nof the Great Oz.\\n\\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen\\nof the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to\\ndo but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the\\nThrone Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see\\nOz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them\\nwhispered:\\n\\n“Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?”\\n\\n“Of course,” answered the girl, “if he will see me.”\\n\\n“Oh, he will see you,” said the soldier who had taken her message to\\nthe Wizard, “although he does not like to have people ask to see him.\\nIndeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you\\ncame from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned\\nyour silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about\\nthe mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his\\npresence.”\\n\\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, “That is the\\nsignal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.”\\n\\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\\nherself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high\\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\\nlarge emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a\\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a\\nwonderful manner.\\n\\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and\\nsparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair\\nwas an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs\\nwhatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose\\nand mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\\n\\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly\\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\\nDorothy heard a voice say:\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”\\n\\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big\\nHead; so she took courage and answered:\\n\\n“I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.”\\n\\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the\\nvoice:\\n\\n“Where did you get the silver shoes?”\\n\\n“I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\\nher and killed her,” she replied.\\n\\n“Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?” continued the voice.\\n\\n“That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\\ngood-bye and sent me to you,” said the girl.\\n\\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the\\ntruth. Then Oz asked, “What do you wish me to do?”\\n\\n“Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,” she\\nanswered earnestly. “I don’t like your country, although it is so\\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\\nbeing away so long.”\\n\\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\\nevery part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\\n\\n“Why should I do this for you?” asked Oz.\\n\\n“Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard\\nand I am only a little girl.”\\n\\n“But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,” said\\nOz.\\n\\n“That just happened,” returned Dorothy simply; “I could not help it.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the Head, “I will give you my answer. You have no right to\\nexpect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in\\nreturn. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If\\nyou wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do\\nsomething for me first. Help me and I will help you.”\\n\\n“What must I do?” asked the girl.\\n\\n“Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” answered Oz.\\n\\n“But I cannot!” exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.\\n\\n“You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which\\nbear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all\\nthis land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to\\nKansas—but not before.”\\n\\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the\\neyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz\\nfelt that she could help him if she would.\\n\\n“I never killed anything, willingly,” she sobbed. “Even if I wanted to,\\nhow could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,\\ncannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?”\\n\\n“I do not know,” said the Head; “but that is my answer, and until the\\nWicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember\\nthat the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to be killed.\\nNow go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.”\\n\\nSorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion\\nand the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had\\nsaid to her. “There is no hope for me,” she said sadly, “for Oz will\\nnot send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and\\nthat I can never do.”\\n\\nHer friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy\\nwent to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to\\nsleep.\\n\\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the\\nScarecrow and said:\\n\\n“Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.”\\n\\nSo the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne\\nRoom, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady.\\nShe was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green\\nlocks a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings,\\ngorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest\\nbreath of air reached them.\\n\\nWhen the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would\\nlet him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly,\\nand said:\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”\\n\\nNow the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had\\ntold him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.\\n\\n“I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains,\\nand I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead\\nof straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your\\ndominions.”\\n\\n“Why should I do this for you?” asked the Lady.\\n\\n“Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,”\\nanswered the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I never grant favors without some return,” said Oz; “but this much I\\nwill promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I\\nwill bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you\\nwill be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.”\\n\\n“I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,” said the Scarecrow, in\\nsurprise.\\n\\n“So I did. I don’t care who kills her. But until she is dead I will not\\ngrant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned\\nthe brains you so greatly desire.”\\n\\nThe Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what\\nOz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard\\nwas not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.\\n\\n“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “she needs a heart as much as the\\nTin Woodman.”\\n\\nOn the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin\\nWoodman and said:\\n\\n“Oz has sent for you. Follow me.”\\n\\nSo the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He\\ndid not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he\\nhoped it would be the lovely Lady. “For,” he said to himself, “if it is\\nthe head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no\\nheart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the\\nlovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves\\nsaid to be kindly hearted.”\\n\\nBut when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the\\nHead nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast.\\nIt was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly\\nstrong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a\\nrhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long\\narms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs.\\nThick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more\\ndreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the\\nTin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud\\nand fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all\\nafraid, although he was much disappointed.\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” spoke the Beast, in a voice that was\\none great roar. “Who are you, and why do you seek me?”\\n\\n“I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot\\nlove. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.”\\n\\n“Why should I do this?” demanded the Beast.\\n\\n“Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,” answered the\\nWoodman.\\n\\nOz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: “If you indeed desire a\\nheart, you must earn it.”\\n\\n“How?” asked the Woodman.\\n\\n“Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” replied the Beast.\\n“When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the\\nbiggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.”\\n\\nSo the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and\\ntell them of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly\\nat the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the\\nLion said:\\n\\n“If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so\\nfrighten him that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the lovely\\nLady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my\\nbidding. And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I\\nwill roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us\\nwhat we desire. So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be\\nwell.”\\n\\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to\\nthe great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.\\n\\nThe Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to\\nhis surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and\\nglowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was\\nthat Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he\\ntried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his\\nwhiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door.\\n\\nThen a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the\\nwords it spoke:\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”\\n\\nAnd the Lion answered, “I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I\\ncame to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may\\nbecome the King of Beasts, as men call me.”\\n\\n“Why should I give you courage?” demanded Oz.\\n\\n“Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to\\ngrant my request,” answered the Lion.\\n\\nThe Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, “Bring\\nme proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you\\ncourage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.”\\n\\nThe Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and\\nwhile he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so\\nfuriously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad\\nto find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible\\ninterview with the Wizard.\\n\\n“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy sadly.\\n\\n“There is only one thing we can do,” returned the Lion, “and that is to\\ngo to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy\\nher.”\\n\\n“But suppose we cannot?” said the girl.\\n\\n“Then I shall never have courage,” declared the Lion.\\n\\n“And I shall never have brains,” added the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“And I shall never have a heart,” spoke the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,” said Dorothy,\\nbeginning to cry.\\n\\n“Be careful!” cried the green girl. “The tears will fall on your green\\nsilk gown and spot it.”\\n\\nSo Dorothy dried her eyes and said, “I suppose we must try it; but I am\\nsure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.”\\n\\n“I will go with you; but I’m too much of a coward to kill the Witch,”\\nsaid the Lion.\\n\\n“I will go too,” declared the Scarecrow; “but I shall not be of much\\nhelp to you, I am such a fool.”\\n\\n“I haven’t the heart to harm even a Witch,” remarked the Tin Woodman;\\n“but if you go I certainly shall go with you.”\\n\\nTherefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning,\\nand the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his\\njoints properly oiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw\\nand Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better. The\\ngreen girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy’s basket with\\ngood things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto’s neck with\\na green ribbon.\\n\\nThey went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when\\nthey were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the\\nback yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a\\ngreen egg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XII\\nThe Search for the Wicked Witch\\n\\n\\nThe soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the\\nEmerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the\\nGates lived. This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in\\nhis great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends.\\n\\n“Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“There is no road,” answered the Guardian of the Gates. “No one ever\\nwishes to go that way.”\\n\\n“How, then, are we to find her?” inquired the girl.\\n\\n“That will be easy,” replied the man, “for when she knows you are in\\nthe country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her\\nslaves.”\\n\\n“Perhaps not,” said the Scarecrow, “for we mean to destroy her.”\\n\\n“Oh, that is different,” said the Guardian of the Gates. “No one has\\never destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves\\nof you, as she has of the rest. But take care; for she is wicked and\\nfierce, and may not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the West, where\\nthe sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her.”\\n\\nThey thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West,\\nwalking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies\\nand buttercups. Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on\\nin the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer\\ngreen, but pure white. The ribbon around Toto’s neck had also lost its\\ngreen color and was as white as Dorothy’s dress.\\n\\nThe Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground\\nbecame rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this\\ncountry of the West, and the ground was untilled.\\n\\nIn the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no\\ntrees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and\\nthe Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with\\nthe Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.\\n\\nNow the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as\\npowerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in\\nthe door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy\\nlying asleep, with her friends all about her. They were a long distance\\noff, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she\\nblew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.\\n\\nAt once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great\\nwolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.\\n\\n“Go to those people,” said the Witch, “and tear them to pieces.”\\n\\n“Are you not going to make them your slaves?” asked the leader of the\\nwolves.\\n\\n“No,” she answered, “one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and\\nanother a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into\\nsmall pieces.”\\n\\n“Very well,” said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed\\nby the others.\\n\\nIt was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard\\nthe wolves coming.\\n\\n“This is my fight,” said the Woodman, “so get behind me and I will meet\\nthem as they come.”\\n\\nHe seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of\\nthe wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf’s\\nhead from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could\\nraise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp\\nedge of the Tin Woodman’s weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty\\ntimes a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap\\nbefore the Woodman.\\n\\nThen he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, “It\\nwas a good fight, friend.”\\n\\nThey waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was\\nquite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the\\nTin Woodman told her all. She thanked him for saving them and sat down\\nto breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.\\n\\nNow this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle\\nand looked out with her one eye that could see far off. She saw all her\\nwolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her\\ncountry. This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver\\nwhistle twice.\\n\\nStraightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough\\nto darken the sky.\\n\\nAnd the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, “Fly at once to the\\nstrangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces.”\\n\\nThe wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her\\ncompanions. When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid.\\n\\nBut the Scarecrow said, “This is my battle, so lie down beside me and\\nyou will not be harmed.”\\n\\nSo they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up\\nand stretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were\\nfrightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare\\nto come any nearer. But the King Crow said:\\n\\n“It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out.”\\n\\nThe King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and\\ntwisted its neck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and\\nthe Scarecrow twisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty\\ntimes the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead\\nbeside him. Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they\\nwent upon their journey.\\n\\nWhen the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a\\nheap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her\\nsilver whistle.\\n\\nForthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of\\nblack bees came flying toward her.\\n\\n“Go to the strangers and sting them to death!” commanded the Witch, and\\nthe bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and\\nher friends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the\\nScarecrow had decided what to do.\\n\\n“Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and\\nthe Lion,” he said to the Woodman, “and the bees cannot sting them.”\\nThis the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held\\nToto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.\\n\\nThe bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew\\nat him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting\\nthe Woodman at all. And as bees cannot live when their stings are\\nbroken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick\\nabout the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.\\n\\nThen Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman\\nput the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as\\never. So they started upon their journey once more.\\n\\nThe Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little\\nheaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and\\ngnashed her teeth. And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were\\nthe Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the\\nstrangers and destroy them.\\n\\nThe Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were\\ntold. So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the\\nLion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies\\nwere so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.\\n\\nWhen they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a\\nstrap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to\\nthink what she should do next. She could not understand how all her\\nplans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful\\nWitch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to\\nact.\\n\\nThere was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and\\nrubies running round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it\\ncould call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any\\norder they were given. But no person could command these strange\\ncreatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had\\nused the charm of the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her\\nslaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys\\nhad helped her do this. The second time was when she had fought against\\nthe Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West. The\\nWinged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more could\\nshe use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so\\nuntil all her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce\\nwolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her\\nslaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was\\nonly one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.\\n\\nSo the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it\\nupon her head. Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:\\n\\n“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!”\\n\\nNext she stood upon her right foot and said:\\n\\n“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!”\\n\\nAfter this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:\\n\\n“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!”\\n\\nNow the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling\\nsound was heard in the air. There was a rushing of many wings, a great\\nchattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show\\nthe Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of\\nimmense and powerful wings on his shoulders.\\n\\nOne, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He flew\\nclose to the Witch and said, “You have called us for the third and last\\ntime. What do you command?”\\n\\n“Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except\\nthe Lion,” said the Wicked Witch. “Bring that beast to me, for I have a\\nmind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.”\\n\\n“Your commands shall be obeyed,” said the leader. Then, with a great\\ndeal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place\\nwhere Dorothy and her friends were walking.\\n\\nSome of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the\\nair until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks.\\nHere they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the\\nrocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move\\nnor groan.\\n\\nOthers of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers\\npulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat\\nand boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top\\nbranches of a tall tree.\\n\\nThe remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and\\nwound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable\\nto bite or scratch or struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and\\nflew away with him to the Witch’s castle, where he was placed in a\\nsmall yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not\\nescape.\\n\\nBut Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood, with Toto in her arms,\\nwatching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her\\nturn. The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy\\narms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the\\nmark of the Good Witch’s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short,\\nmotioning the others not to touch her.\\n\\n“We dare not harm this little girl,” he said to them, “for she is\\nprotected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of\\nEvil. All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch\\nand leave her there.”\\n\\nSo, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried\\nher swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they\\nset her down upon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the\\nWitch:\\n\\n“We have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and the\\nScarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The\\nlittle girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your\\npower over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again.”\\n\\nThen all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and\\nnoise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.\\n\\nThe Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark\\non Dorothy’s forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged\\nMonkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked\\ndown at Dorothy’s feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble\\nwith fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At\\nfirst the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened\\nto look into the child’s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them\\nwas, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the\\nSilver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and\\nthought, “I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to\\nuse her power.” Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:\\n\\n“Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you\\ndo not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the\\nScarecrow.”\\n\\nDorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle\\nuntil they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots\\nand kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.\\n\\nDorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as\\nshe could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill\\nher.\\n\\nWith Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the\\ncourtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse\\nher, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to\\ngo to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and\\nbounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and\\nshut the gate again.\\n\\n“If I cannot harness you,” said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through\\nthe bars of the gate, “I can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat\\nuntil you do as I wish.”\\n\\nSo after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day\\nshe came to the gate at noon and asked, “Are you ready to be harnessed\\nlike a horse?”\\n\\nAnd the Lion would answer, “No. If you come in this yard, I will bite\\nyou.”\\n\\nThe reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that\\nevery night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from\\nthe cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw,\\nand Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy\\nmane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to\\nescape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was\\nconstantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the\\nWicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.\\n\\nThe girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch\\nthreatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in\\nher hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of\\nthe mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full\\nof fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with\\nher umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in\\nreturn. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so\\nwicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.\\n\\nDorothy’s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would\\nbe harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes\\nshe would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and\\nlooking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for\\nhis little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas\\nor the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the\\nlittle girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.\\n\\nNow the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver\\nShoes which the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves\\nwere lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of\\nthe Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes,\\nthey would give her more power than all the other things she had lost.\\nShe watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes,\\nthinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty\\nshoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took\\nher bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in\\nDorothy’s room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was\\ngreater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy\\nwas bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let\\nwater touch her in any way.\\n\\nBut the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a\\ntrick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in\\nthe middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the\\niron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the\\nfloor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at\\nfull length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver\\nShoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched\\nit away and put it on her own skinny foot.\\n\\nThe wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for\\nas long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their\\ncharm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how\\nto do so.\\n\\nThe little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew\\nangry, and said to the Witch, “Give me back my shoe!”\\n\\n“I will not,” retorted the Witch, “for it is now my shoe, and not\\nyours.”\\n\\n“You are a wicked creature!” cried Dorothy. “You have no right to take\\nmy shoe from me.”\\n\\n“I shall keep it, just the same,” said the Witch, laughing at her, “and\\nsomeday I shall get the other one from you, too.”\\n\\nThis made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water\\nthat stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to\\nfoot.\\n\\nInstantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as\\nDorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall\\naway.\\n\\n“See what you have done!” she screamed. “In a minute I shall melt\\naway.”\\n\\n“I’m very sorry, indeed,” said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see\\nthe Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.\\n\\n“Didn’t you know water would be the end of me?” asked the Witch, in a\\nwailing, despairing voice.\\n\\n“Of course not,” answered Dorothy. “How should I?”\\n\\n“Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the\\ncastle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a\\nlittle girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked\\ndeeds. Look out—here I go!”\\n\\nWith these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass\\nand began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing\\nthat she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket\\nof water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the\\ndoor. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of\\nthe old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her\\nfoot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to\\nthe courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had\\ncome to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange\\nland.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIII\\nThe Rescue\\n\\n\\nThe Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had\\nbeen melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate\\nof his prison and set him free. They went in together to the castle,\\nwhere Dorothy’s first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell\\nthem that they were no longer slaves.\\n\\nThere was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been\\nmade to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had\\nalways treated them with great cruelty. They kept this day as a\\nholiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and\\ndancing.\\n\\n“If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us,”\\nsaid the Lion, “I should be quite happy.”\\n\\n“Don’t you suppose we could rescue them?” asked the girl anxiously.\\n\\n“We can try,” answered the Lion.\\n\\nSo they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to\\nrescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted\\nto do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from\\nbondage. So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they\\nknew the most, and they all started away. They traveled that day and\\npart of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin\\nWoodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him, but the blade\\nwas rusted and the handle broken off short.\\n\\nThe Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to\\nthe Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the\\nsad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry.\\nWhen they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:\\n\\n“Are any of your people tinsmiths?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths,” they told her.\\n\\n“Then bring them to me,” she said. And when the tinsmiths came,\\nbringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, “Can you\\nstraighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into\\nshape again, and solder him together where he is broken?”\\n\\nThe tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that\\nthey thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever. So\\nthey set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and\\nworked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and\\nbending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body\\nand head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into\\nhis old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there\\nwere several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as\\nthe Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.\\n\\nWhen, at last, he walked into Dorothy’s room and thanked her for\\nrescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy\\nhad to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his\\njoints would not be rusted. At the same time her own tears fell thick\\nand fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears\\ndid not need to be wiped away. As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so\\noften with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was\\nobliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it\\ndried.\\n\\n“If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,” said the Tin Woodman,\\nwhen Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, “I\\nshould be quite happy.”\\n\\n“We must try to find him,” said the girl.\\n\\nSo she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and\\npart of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of\\nwhich the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow’s clothes.\\n\\nIt was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could\\nclimb it; but the Woodman said at once, “I’ll chop it down, and then we\\ncan get the Scarecrow’s clothes.”\\n\\nNow while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself,\\nanother of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of\\nsolid gold and fitted it to the Woodman’s axe, instead of the old\\nbroken handle. Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed\\nand it glistened like burnished silver.\\n\\nAs soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short\\ntime the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow’s clothes\\nfell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.\\n\\nDorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the\\ncastle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold!\\nhere was the Scarecrow, as good as ever, thanking them over and over\\nagain for saving him.\\n\\nNow that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy\\ndays at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to\\nmake them comfortable.\\n\\nBut one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, “We must go back to\\nOz, and claim his promise.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the Woodman, “at last I shall get my heart.”\\n\\n“And I shall get my brains,” added the Scarecrow joyfully.\\n\\n“And I shall get my courage,” said the Lion thoughtfully.\\n\\n“And I shall get back to Kansas,” cried Dorothy, clapping her hands.\\n“Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!”\\n\\nThis they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together\\nand bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and\\nthey had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay\\nand rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West. Finding they were\\ndetermined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden\\ncollar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with\\ndiamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick,\\nto keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a\\nsilver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.\\n\\nEvery one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return,\\nand all shook hands with them until their arms ached.\\n\\nDorothy went to the Witch’s cupboard to fill her basket with food for\\nthe journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap. She tried it on her own\\nhead and found that it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything\\nabout the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so\\nshe made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.\\n\\nThen, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald\\nCity; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to\\ncarry with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIV\\nThe Winged Monkeys\\n\\n\\nYou will remember there was no road—not even a pathway—between the\\ncastle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four\\ntravelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so\\nsent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder to\\nfind their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow\\ndaisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go\\nstraight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right\\nway. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know\\nwhich was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were\\nlost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night\\nthe moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet\\nsmelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman.\\n\\nThe next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if\\nthey were quite sure which way they were going.\\n\\n“If we walk far enough,” said Dorothy, “I am sure we shall sometime\\ncome to some place.”\\n\\nBut day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but\\nthe scarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.\\n\\n“We have surely lost our way,” he said, “and unless we find it again in\\ntime to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.”\\n\\n“Nor I my heart,” declared the Tin Woodman. “It seems to me I can\\nscarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long\\njourney.”\\n\\n“You see,” said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, “I haven’t the\\ncourage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.”\\n\\nThen Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her\\ncompanions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that\\nfor the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly\\nthat flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked\\nat Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.\\n\\n“Suppose we call the field mice,” she suggested. “They could probably\\ntell us the way to the Emerald City.”\\n\\n“To be sure they could,” cried the Scarecrow. “Why didn’t we think of\\nthat before?”\\n\\nDorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck\\nsince the Queen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they\\nheard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came\\nrunning up to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her\\nsqueaky little voice:\\n\\n“What can I do for my friends?”\\n\\n“We have lost our way,” said Dorothy. “Can you tell us where the\\nEmerald City is?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” answered the Queen; “but it is a great way off, for you\\nhave had it at your backs all this time.” Then she noticed Dorothy’s\\nGolden Cap, and said, “Why don’t you use the charm of the Cap, and call\\nthe Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in\\nless than an hour.”\\n\\n“I didn’t know there was a charm,” answered Dorothy, in surprise. “What\\nis it?”\\n\\n“It is written inside the Golden Cap,” replied the Queen of the Mice.\\n“But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for\\nthey are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.”\\n\\n“Won’t they hurt me?” asked the girl anxiously.\\n\\n“Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!” And she\\nscampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.\\n\\nDorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon\\nthe lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the\\ndirections carefully and put the Cap upon her head.\\n\\n“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!” she said, standing on her left foot.\\n\\n“What did you say?” asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was\\ndoing.\\n\\n“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!” Dorothy went on, standing this time on her\\nright foot.\\n\\n“Hello!” replied the Tin Woodman calmly.\\n\\n“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!” said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.\\nThis ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering\\nand flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.\\n\\nThe King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, “What is your command?”\\n\\n“We wish to go to the Emerald City,” said the child, “and we have lost\\nour way.”\\n\\n“We will carry you,” replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than\\ntwo of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her.\\nOthers took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little\\nMonkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to\\nbite him.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for\\nthey remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before;\\nbut they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air\\nquite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and\\nwoods far below them.\\n\\nDorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys,\\none of them the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and\\nwere careful not to hurt her.\\n\\n“Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?” she asked.\\n\\n“That is a long story,” answered the King, with a winged laugh; “but as\\nwe have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you\\nabout it, if you wish.”\\n\\n“I shall be glad to hear it,” she replied.\\n\\n“Once,” began the leader, “we were a free people, living happily in the\\ngreat forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and\\ndoing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some\\nof us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull\\nthe tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing\\nnuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and\\nhappy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was\\nmany years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this\\nland.\\n\\n“There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who\\nwas also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the\\npeople, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name\\nwas Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great\\nblocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that\\nshe could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much\\ntoo stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,\\nhowever, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his\\nyears. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she\\nwould make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used\\nall her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any\\nwoman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,\\nwas said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly\\nbeauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to\\nmake everything ready for the wedding.\\n\\n“My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which\\nlived in the forest near Gayelette’s palace, and the old fellow loved a\\njoke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my\\ngrandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking\\nbeside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and\\npurple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could\\ndo. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in\\ntheir arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then\\ndropped him into the water.\\n\\n“‘Swim out, my fine fellow,’ cried my grandfather, ‘and see if the\\nwater has spotted your clothes.’ Quelala was much too wise not to swim,\\nand he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He\\nlaughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.\\nBut when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and\\nvelvet all ruined by the river.\\n\\n“The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had\\nall the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that\\ntheir wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had\\ntreated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded\\nhard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings\\ntied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette\\nfinally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever\\nafter do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This\\nCap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to\\nhave cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and\\nall the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how\\nit happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the\\nGolden Cap, whosoever he may be.”\\n\\n“And what became of them?” asked Dorothy, who had been greatly\\ninterested in the story.\\n\\n“Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,” replied the Monkey,\\n“he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not\\nbear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he\\nhad married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never\\nagain set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we\\nwere all afraid of her.\\n\\n“This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the\\nhands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies,\\nand afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the\\nGolden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your\\nwishes upon us.”\\n\\nAs the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the\\ngreen, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at\\nthe rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The\\nstrange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of\\nthe City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away,\\nfollowed by all his band.\\n\\n“That was a good ride,” said the little girl.\\n\\n“Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles,” replied the Lion. “How\\nlucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XV\\nThe Discovery of Oz, the Terrible\\n\\n\\nThe four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang\\nthe bell. After ringing several times, it was opened by the same\\nGuardian of the Gates they had met before.\\n\\n“What! are you back again?” he asked, in surprise.\\n\\n“Do you not see us?” answered the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.”\\n\\n“We did visit her,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“And she let you go again?” asked the man, in wonder.\\n\\n“She could not help it, for she is melted,” explained the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed,” said the man. “Who melted\\nher?”\\n\\n“It was Dorothy,” said the Lion gravely.\\n\\n“Good gracious!” exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before\\nher.\\n\\nThen he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from\\nthe great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before. Afterward\\nthey passed on through the gate into the Emerald City. When the people\\nheard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked\\nWitch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed\\nthem in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.\\n\\nThe soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door,\\nbut he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful\\ngreen girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they\\nmight rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.\\n\\nThe soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the\\nother travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch;\\nbut Oz made no reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them\\nat once, but he did not. They had no word from him the next day, nor\\nthe next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at\\nlast they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion,\\nafter sending them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the Scarecrow\\nat last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if\\nhe did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged\\nMonkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not.\\nWhen the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he\\nsent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after\\nnine o’clock the next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in\\nthe Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.\\n\\nThe four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift\\nOz had promised to bestow on him. Dorothy fell asleep only once, and\\nthen she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how\\nglad she was to have her little girl at home again.\\n\\nPromptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier\\ncame to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room\\nof the Great Oz.\\n\\nOf course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he\\nhad taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about\\nand saw no one at all in the room. They kept close to the door and\\ncloser to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more\\ndreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.\\n\\nPresently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere\\nnear the top of the great dome, and it said:\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?”\\n\\nThey looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one,\\nDorothy asked, “Where are you?”\\n\\n“I am everywhere,” answered the Voice, “but to the eyes of common\\nmortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you\\nmay converse with me.” Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come\\nstraight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in\\na row while Dorothy said:\\n\\n“We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.”\\n\\n“What promise?” asked Oz.\\n\\n“You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was\\ndestroyed,” said the girl.\\n\\n“And you promised to give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“And you promised to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“And you promised to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.\\n\\n“Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?” asked the Voice, and Dorothy\\nthought it trembled a little.\\n\\n“Yes,” she answered, “I melted her with a bucket of water.”\\n\\n“Dear me,” said the Voice, “how sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for\\nI must have time to think it over.”\\n\\n“You’ve had plenty of time already,” said the Tin Woodman angrily.\\n\\n“We shan’t wait a day longer,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“You must keep your promises to us!” exclaimed Dorothy.\\n\\nThe Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave\\na large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped\\naway from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a\\ncorner. As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next\\nmoment all of them were filled with wonder. For they saw, standing in\\njust the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head\\nand a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were.\\nThe Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and\\ncried out, “Who are you?”\\n\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” said the little man, in a trembling\\nvoice. “But don’t strike me—please don’t—and I’ll do anything you want\\nme to.”\\n\\nOur friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.\\n\\n“I thought Oz was a great Head,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,” said the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,” exclaimed the Lion.\\n\\n“No, you are all wrong,” said the little man meekly. “I have been\\nmaking believe.”\\n\\n“Making believe!” cried Dorothy. “Are you not a Great Wizard?”\\n\\n“Hush, my dear,” he said. “Don’t speak so loud, or you will be\\noverheard—and I should be ruined. I’m supposed to be a Great Wizard.”\\n\\n“And aren’t you?” she asked.\\n\\n“Not a bit of it, my dear; I’m just a common man.”\\n\\n“You’re more than that,” said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; “you’re\\na humbug.”\\n\\n“Exactly so!” declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if\\nit pleased him. “I am a humbug.”\\n\\n“But this is terrible,” said the Tin Woodman. “How shall I ever get my\\nheart?”\\n\\n“Or I my courage?” asked the Lion.\\n\\n“Or I my brains?” wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes\\nwith his coat sleeve.\\n\\n“My dear friends,” said Oz, “I pray you not to speak of these little\\nthings. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I’m in at being found\\nout.”\\n\\n“Doesn’t anyone else know you’re a humbug?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“No one knows it but you four—and myself,” replied Oz. “I have fooled\\neveryone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a\\ngreat mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will\\nnot see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.”\\n\\n“But, I don’t understand,” said Dorothy, in bewilderment. “How was it\\nthat you appeared to me as a great Head?”\\n\\n“That was one of my tricks,” answered Oz. “Step this way, please, and I\\nwill tell you all about it.”\\n\\nHe led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and\\nthey all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great\\nHead, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully\\npainted face.\\n\\n“This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,” said Oz. “I stood behind the\\nscreen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.”\\n\\n“But how about the voice?” she inquired.\\n\\n“Oh, I am a ventriloquist,” said the little man. “I can throw the sound\\nof my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of\\nthe Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.” He showed\\nthe Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be\\nthe lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was\\nnothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their\\nsides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also\\nfrom the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was\\npoured upon it the ball burned fiercely.\\n\\n“Really,” said the Scarecrow, “you ought to be ashamed of yourself for\\nbeing such a humbug.”\\n\\n“I am—I certainly am,” answered the little man sorrowfully; “but it was\\nthe only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of\\nchairs; and I will tell you my story.”\\n\\nSo they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.\\n\\n“I was born in Omaha—”\\n\\n“Why, that isn’t very far from Kansas!” cried Dorothy.\\n\\n“No, but it’s farther from here,” he said, shaking his head at her\\nsadly. “When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very\\nwell trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or\\nbeast.” Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears\\nand looked everywhere to see where she was. “After a time,” continued\\nOz, “I tired of that, and became a balloonist.”\\n\\n“What is that?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of\\npeople together and get them to pay to see the circus,” he explained.\\n\\n“Oh,” she said, “I know.”\\n\\n“Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so\\nthat I couldn’t come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so\\nfar that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles\\naway. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the\\nmorning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a\\nstrange and beautiful country.\\n\\n“It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself\\nin the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,\\nthought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because\\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\\n\\n“Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\\nbuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.\\nThen I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call\\nit the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green\\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.”\\n\\n“But isn’t everything here green?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“No more than in any other city,” replied Oz; “but when you wear green\\nspectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The\\nEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man\\nwhen the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my\\npeople have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them\\nthink it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful\\nplace, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing\\nthat is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and\\nthey like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself\\nup and would not see any of them.\\n\\n“One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical\\npowers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do\\nwonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they\\nruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.\\nFortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew\\nthey would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were\\nterribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they\\nthemselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in\\ndeadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I\\nwas when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.\\nWhen you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would\\nonly do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I\\nam ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.”\\n\\n“I think you are a very bad man,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Oh, no, my dear; I’m really a very good man, but I’m a very bad\\nWizard, I must admit.”\\n\\n“Can’t you give me brains?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“You don’t need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has\\nbrains, but it doesn’t know much. Experience is the only thing that\\nbrings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience\\nyou are sure to get.”\\n\\n“That may all be true,” said the Scarecrow, “but I shall be very\\nunhappy unless you give me brains.”\\n\\nThe false Wizard looked at him carefully.\\n\\n“Well,” he said with a sigh, “I’m not much of a magician, as I said;\\nbut if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head\\nwith brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find\\nthat out for yourself.”\\n\\n“Oh, thank you—thank you!” cried the Scarecrow. “I’ll find a way to use\\nthem, never fear!”\\n\\n“But how about my courage?” asked the Lion anxiously.\\n\\n“You have plenty of courage, I am sure,” answered Oz. “All you need is\\nconfidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid\\nwhen it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are\\nafraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.”\\n\\n“Perhaps I have, but I’m scared just the same,” said the Lion. “I shall\\nreally be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that\\nmakes one forget he is afraid.”\\n\\n“Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,” replied Oz.\\n\\n“How about my heart?” asked the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“Why, as for that,” answered Oz, “I think you are wrong to want a\\nheart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in\\nluck not to have a heart.”\\n\\n“That must be a matter of opinion,” said the Tin Woodman. “For my part,\\nI will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me\\nthe heart.”\\n\\n“Very well,” answered Oz meekly. “Come to me tomorrow and you shall\\nhave a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well\\ncontinue the part a little longer.”\\n\\n“And now,” said Dorothy, “how am I to get back to Kansas?”\\n\\n“We shall have to think about that,” replied the little man. “Give me\\ntwo or three days to consider the matter and I’ll try to find a way to\\ncarry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be treated as\\nmy guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon\\nyou and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in\\nreturn for my help—such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no\\none I am a humbug.”\\n\\nThey agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to\\ntheir rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that “The Great and\\nTerrible Humbug,” as she called him, would find a way to send her back\\nto Kansas, and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVI\\nThe Magic Art of the Great Humbug\\n\\n\\nNext morning the Scarecrow said to his friends:\\n\\n“Congratulate me. I am going to Oz to get my brains at last. When I\\nreturn I shall be as other men are.”\\n\\n“I have always liked you as you were,” said Dorothy simply.\\n\\n“It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,” he replied. “But surely you\\nwill think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain\\nis going to turn out.” Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful\\nvoice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.\\n\\n“Come in,” said Oz.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the\\nwindow, engaged in deep thought.\\n\\n“I have come for my brains,” remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.\\n\\n“Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,” replied Oz. “You must excuse\\nme for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put\\nyour brains in their proper place.”\\n\\n“That’s all right,” said the Scarecrow. “You are quite welcome to take\\nmy head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on\\nagain.”\\n\\nSo the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he\\nentered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed\\nwith a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together\\nthoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow’s head with the mixture\\nand stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.\\n\\nWhen he had fastened the Scarecrow’s head on his body again he said to\\nhim, “Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of\\nbran-new brains.”\\n\\nThe Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his\\ngreatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his\\nfriends.\\n\\nDorothy looked at him curiously. His head was quite bulged out at the\\ntop with brains.\\n\\n“How do you feel?” she asked.\\n\\n“I feel wise indeed,” he answered earnestly. “When I get used to my\\nbrains I shall know everything.”\\n\\n“Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?” asked the\\nTin Woodman.\\n\\n“That is proof that he is sharp,” remarked the Lion.\\n\\n“Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,” said the Woodman. So he\\nwalked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.\\n\\n“Come in,” called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, “I have come\\nfor my heart.”\\n\\n“Very well,” answered the little man. “But I shall have to cut a hole\\nin your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hope it\\nwon’t hurt you.”\\n\\n“Oh, no,” answered the Woodman. “I shall not feel it at all.”\\n\\nSo Oz brought a pair of tinsmith’s shears and cut a small, square hole\\nin the left side of the Tin Woodman’s breast. Then, going to a chest of\\ndrawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed\\nwith sawdust.\\n\\n“Isn’t it a beauty?” he asked.\\n\\n“It is, indeed!” replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. “But is\\nit a kind heart?”\\n\\n“Oh, very!” answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman’s breast and\\nthen replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it\\nhad been cut.\\n\\n“There,” said he; “now you have a heart that any man might be proud of.\\nI’m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn’t\\nbe helped.”\\n\\n“Never mind the patch,” exclaimed the happy Woodman. “I am very\\ngrateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.”\\n\\n“Don’t speak of it,” replied Oz.\\n\\nThen the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy\\non account of his good fortune.\\n\\nThe Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.\\n\\n“Come in,” said Oz.\\n\\n“I have come for my courage,” announced the Lion, entering the room.\\n\\n“Very well,” answered the little man; “I will get it for you.”\\n\\nHe went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a\\nsquare green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold\\ndish, beautifully carved. Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who\\nsniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:\\n\\n“Drink.”\\n\\n“What is it?” asked the Lion.\\n\\n“Well,” answered Oz, “if it were inside of you, it would be courage.\\nYou know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this\\nreally cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. Therefore\\nI advise you to drink it as soon as possible.”\\n\\nThe Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.\\n\\n“How do you feel now?” asked Oz.\\n\\n“Full of courage,” replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his\\nfriends to tell them of his good fortune.\\n\\nOz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought\\nthey wanted. “How can I help being a humbug,” he said, “when all these\\npeople make me do things that everybody knows can’t be done? It was\\neasy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because\\nthey imagined I could do anything. But it will take more than\\nimagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I’m sure I don’t know\\nhow it can be done.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVII\\nHow the Balloon Was Launched\\n\\n\\nFor three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz. These were sad days for\\nthe little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and\\ncontented. The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his\\nhead; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could\\nunderstand them but himself. When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt\\nhis heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had\\ndiscovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had\\nowned when he was made of flesh. The Lion declared he was afraid of\\nnothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the\\nfierce Kalidahs.\\n\\nThus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed\\nmore than ever to get back to Kansas.\\n\\nOn the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she\\nentered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly:\\n\\n“Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this\\ncountry.”\\n\\n“And back to Kansas?” she asked eagerly.\\n\\n“Well, I’m not sure about Kansas,” said Oz, “for I haven’t the faintest\\nnotion which way it lies. But the first thing to do is to cross the\\ndesert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.”\\n\\n“How can I cross the desert?” she inquired.\\n\\n“Well, I’ll tell you what I think,” said the little man. “You see, when\\nI came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the\\nair, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get\\nacross the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my\\npowers to make a cyclone; but I’ve been thinking the matter over, and I\\nbelieve I can make a balloon.”\\n\\n“How?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“A balloon,” said Oz, “is made of silk, which is coated with glue to\\nkeep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be\\nno trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas\\nto fill the balloon with, to make it float.”\\n\\n“If it won’t float,” remarked Dorothy, “it will be of no use to us.”\\n\\n“True,” answered Oz. “But there is another way to make it float, which\\nis to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn’t as good as gas, for if the\\nair should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we\\nshould be lost.”\\n\\n“We!” exclaimed the girl. “Are you going with me?”\\n\\n“Yes, of course,” replied Oz. “I am tired of being such a humbug. If I\\nshould go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a\\nWizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.\\nSo I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.\\nI’d much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.”\\n\\n“I shall be glad to have your company,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Thank you,” he answered. “Now, if you will help me sew the silk\\ntogether, we will begin to work on our balloon.”\\n\\nSo Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips\\nof silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First\\nthere was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and\\nthen a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon\\nin different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew\\nall the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of\\ngreen silk more than twenty feet long.\\n\\nThen Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it\\nairtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.\\n\\n“But we must have a basket to ride in,” he said. So he sent the soldier\\nwith the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened\\nwith many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.\\n\\nWhen it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to\\nmake a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The\\nnews spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the\\nwonderful sight.\\n\\nOz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the\\npeople gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a\\nbig pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom\\nof the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it\\nwould be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out\\nand rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the\\nground.\\n\\nThen Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:\\n\\n“I am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow\\nwill rule over you. I command you to obey him as you would me.”\\n\\nThe balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to\\nthe ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much\\nlighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into\\nthe sky.\\n\\n“Come, Dorothy!” cried the Wizard. “Hurry up, or the balloon will fly\\naway.”\\n\\n“I can’t find Toto anywhere,” replied Dorothy, who did not wish to\\nleave her little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a\\nkitten, and Dorothy at last found him. She picked him up and ran\\ntowards the balloon.\\n\\nShe was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to\\nhelp her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon\\nrose into the air without her.\\n\\n“Come back!” she screamed. “I want to go, too!”\\n\\n“I can’t come back, my dear,” called Oz from the basket. “Good-bye!”\\n\\n“Good-bye!” shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where\\nthe Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and\\nfarther into the sky.\\n\\nAnd that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard,\\nthough he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we\\nknow. But the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one another:\\n\\n“Oz was always our friend. When he was here he built for us this\\nbeautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise\\nScarecrow to rule over us.”\\n\\nStill, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful\\nWizard, and would not be comforted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVIII\\nAway to the South\\n\\n\\nDorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas\\nagain; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone\\nup in a balloon. And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her\\ncompanions.\\n\\nThe Tin Woodman came to her and said:\\n\\n“Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave\\nme my lovely heart. I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone,\\nif you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust.”\\n\\n“With pleasure,” she answered, and brought a towel at once. Then the\\nTin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears\\ncarefully and wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished, he\\nthanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled\\noil-can, to guard against mishap.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he\\nwas not a Wizard the people were proud of him. “For,” they said, “there\\nis not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man.”\\nAnd, so far as they knew, they were quite right.\\n\\nThe morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers\\nmet in the Throne Room and talked matters over. The Scarecrow sat in\\nthe big throne and the others stood respectfully before him.\\n\\n“We are not so unlucky,” said the new ruler, “for this Palace and the\\nEmerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please. When I\\nremember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer’s\\ncornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am\\nquite satisfied with my lot.”\\n\\n“I also,” said the Tin Woodman, “am well-pleased with my new heart;\\nand, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world.”\\n\\n“For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that\\never lived, if not braver,” said the Lion modestly.\\n\\n“If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,”\\ncontinued the Scarecrow, “we might all be happy together.”\\n\\n“But I don’t want to live here,” cried Dorothy. “I want to go to\\nKansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.”\\n\\n“Well, then, what can be done?” inquired the Woodman.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins\\nand needles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said:\\n\\n“Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the\\ndesert?”\\n\\n“I never thought of that!” said Dorothy joyfully. “It’s just the thing.\\nI’ll go at once for the Golden Cap.”\\n\\nWhen she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and\\nsoon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and\\nstood beside her.\\n\\n“This is the second time you have called us,” said the Monkey King,\\nbowing before the little girl. “What do you wish?”\\n\\n“I want you to fly with me to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\n\\nBut the Monkey King shook his head.\\n\\n“That cannot be done,” he said. “We belong to this country alone, and\\ncannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,\\nand I suppose there never will be, for they don’t belong there. We\\nshall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross\\nthe desert. Good-bye.”\\n\\nAnd with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away\\nthrough the window, followed by all his band.\\n\\nDorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. “I have wasted the charm\\nof the Golden Cap to no purpose,” she said, “for the Winged Monkeys\\ncannot help me.”\\n\\n“It is certainly too bad!” said the tender-hearted Woodman.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly\\nthat Dorothy feared it would burst.\\n\\n“Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,” he said, “and ask\\nhis advice.”\\n\\nSo the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for\\nwhile Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.\\n\\n“This little girl,” said the Scarecrow to the soldier, “wishes to cross\\nthe desert. How can she do so?”\\n\\n“I cannot tell,” answered the soldier, “for nobody has ever crossed the\\ndesert, unless it is Oz himself.”\\n\\n“Is there no one who can help me?” asked Dorothy earnestly.\\n\\n“Glinda might,” he suggested.\\n\\n“Who is Glinda?” inquired the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches,\\nand rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of\\nthe desert, so she may know a way to cross it.”\\n\\n“Glinda is a Good Witch, isn’t she?” asked the child.\\n\\n“The Quadlings think she is good,” said the soldier, “and she is kind\\nto everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows\\nhow to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.”\\n\\n“How can I get to her castle?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“The road is straight to the South,” he answered, “but it is said to be\\nfull of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a\\nrace of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For\\nthis reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.”\\n\\nThe soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:\\n\\n“It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is\\nto travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of\\ncourse, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.”\\n\\n“You must have been thinking again,” remarked the Tin Woodman.\\n\\n“I have,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“I shall go with Dorothy,” declared the Lion, “for I am tired of your\\ncity and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild\\nbeast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.”\\n\\n“That is true,” agreed the Woodman. “My axe may be of service to her;\\nso I also will go with her to the Land of the South.”\\n\\n“When shall we start?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Are you going?” they asked, in surprise.\\n\\n“Certainly. If it wasn’t for Dorothy I should never have had brains.\\nShe lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the\\nEmerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never\\nleave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Dorothy gratefully. “You are all very kind to me. But\\nI should like to start as soon as possible.”\\n\\n“We shall go tomorrow morning,” returned the Scarecrow. “So now let us\\nall get ready, for it will be a long journey.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIX\\nAttacked by the Fighting Trees\\n\\n\\nThe next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and\\nthey all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had\\nwalked with them as far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw\\nthem again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City\\nto get into new trouble. But he at once unlocked their spectacles,\\nwhich he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to\\ncarry with them.\\n\\n“You are now our ruler,” he said to the Scarecrow; “so you must come\\nback to us as soon as possible.”\\n\\n“I certainly shall if I am able,” the Scarecrow replied; “but I must\\nhelp Dorothy to get home, first.”\\n\\nAs Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:\\n\\n“I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has\\nbeen good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.”\\n\\n“Don’t try, my dear,” he answered. “We should like to keep you with us,\\nbut if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a\\nway.” He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth\\nand started upon their journey.\\n\\nThe sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the\\nLand of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed\\nand chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of\\ngetting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of\\nuse to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and\\nwhisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country\\nagain, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies,\\nbarking merrily all the time.\\n\\n“City life does not agree with me at all,” remarked the Lion, as they\\nwalked along at a brisk pace. “I have lost much flesh since I lived\\nthere, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how\\ncourageous I have grown.”\\n\\nThey now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they\\ncould see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and\\nhigh up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.\\n\\n“Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,” said the Tin Woodman, as he\\nfelt his heart rattling around in his breast.\\n\\n“He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,” said the\\nScarecrow.\\n\\n“If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,” added the\\nLion, “he would have been a brave man.”\\n\\nDorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he\\nhad done his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man,\\neven if he was a bad Wizard.\\n\\nThe first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers\\nthat stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that\\nnight on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they\\nrested very well indeed.\\n\\nIn the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There\\nwas no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and\\nleft as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change\\nthe direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked\\nfor the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with\\nsuch wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass\\nunderneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under\\nthe first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next\\nminute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his\\nfellow travelers.\\n\\nThis did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked\\nrather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.\\n\\n“Here is another space between the trees,” called the Lion.\\n\\n“Let me try it first,” said the Scarecrow, “for it doesn’t hurt me to\\nget thrown about.” He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its\\nbranches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.\\n\\n“This is strange,” exclaimed Dorothy. “What shall we do?”\\n\\n“The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our\\njourney,” remarked the Lion.\\n\\n“I believe I will try it myself,” said the Woodman, and shouldering his\\naxe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so\\nroughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped\\nat it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking\\nall its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under\\nit.\\n\\n“Come on!” he shouted to the others. “Be quick!” They all ran forward\\nand passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught\\nby a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly\\nchopped off the branch and set the little dog free.\\n\\nThe other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they\\nmade up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down\\ntheir branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the\\nforest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out\\nof it.\\n\\nThe four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came\\nto the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found\\nbefore them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was\\nsmooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.\\n\\n“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\n“I will make a ladder,” said the Tin Woodman, “for we certainly must\\nclimb over the wall.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XX\\nThe Dainty China Country\\n\\n\\nWhile the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the\\nforest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk.\\nThe Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.\\n\\nThe Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:\\n\\n“I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.”\\n\\n“Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall,” replied the\\nWoodman. “When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the\\nother side.”\\n\\nAfter a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin\\nWoodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The\\nScarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the\\nladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was\\nso awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from\\nfalling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the\\nScarecrow said, “Oh, my!”\\n\\n“Go on,” exclaimed Dorothy.\\n\\nSo the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the\\nwall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried, “Oh, my!” just as the\\nScarecrow had done.\\n\\nThen Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him\\nbe still.\\n\\nThe Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but\\nboth of them cried, “Oh, my!” as soon as they looked over the wall.\\nWhen they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked\\ndown and saw a strange sight.\\n\\nBefore them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and\\nshining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were\\nmany houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors.\\nThese houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as\\nhigh as Dorothy’s waist. There were also pretty little barns, with\\nchina fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs\\nand chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.\\n\\nBut the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer\\ncountry. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored\\nbodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most\\ngorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in\\nknee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and\\ngolden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon\\ntheir heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns\\nin ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,\\npointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of\\nchina, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of\\nthem was no higher than Dorothy’s knee.\\n\\nNo one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little\\npurple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and\\nbarked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.\\n\\n“How shall we get down?” asked Dorothy.\\n\\nThey found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the\\nScarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that\\nthe hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not\\nto light on his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were\\nsafely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite\\nflattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.\\n\\n“We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,”\\nsaid Dorothy, “for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except\\ndue South.”\\n\\nThey began walking through the country of the china people, and the\\nfirst thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As\\nthey drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,\\nthe pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china\\nground with a great clatter.\\n\\nDorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and\\nthat the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor\\nmilkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.\\n\\n“There!” cried the milkmaid angrily. “See what you have done! My cow\\nhas broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender’s shop and have\\nit glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my\\ncow?”\\n\\n“I’m very sorry,” returned Dorothy. “Please forgive us.”\\n\\nBut the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She\\npicked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping\\non three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful\\nglances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked\\nelbow close to her side.\\n\\nDorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.\\n\\n“We must be very careful here,” said the kind-hearted Woodman, “or we\\nmay hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it.”\\n\\nA little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young\\nPrincess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run\\naway.\\n\\nDorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But\\nthe china girl cried out:\\n\\n“Don’t chase me! Don’t chase me!”\\n\\nShe had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Because,” answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away,\\n“if I run I may fall down and break myself.”\\n\\n“But could you not be mended?” asked the girl.\\n\\n“Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,”\\nreplied the Princess.\\n\\n“I suppose not,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,” continued the china lady,\\n“who is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so\\noften that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn’t look at all\\npretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.”\\n\\nIndeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy\\ncould see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and\\ngreen he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way\\nand showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.\\n\\nThe Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his\\ncheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:\\n\\n    “My lady fair,\\n   Why do you stare\\nAt poor old Mr. Joker?\\n    You’re quite as stiff\\n    And prim as if\\nYou’d eaten up a poker!”\\n\\n\\n“Be quiet, sir!” said the Princess. “Can’t you see these are strangers,\\nand should be treated with respect?”\\n\\n“Well, that’s respect, I expect,” declared the Clown, and immediately\\nstood upon his head.\\n\\n“Don’t mind Mr. Joker,” said the Princess to Dorothy. “He is\\nconsiderably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish.”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t mind him a bit,” said Dorothy. “But you are so beautiful,”\\nshe continued, “that I am sure I could love you dearly. Won’t you let\\nme carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em’s mantel? I could\\ncarry you in my basket.”\\n\\n“That would make me very unhappy,” answered the china Princess. “You\\nsee, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move\\naround as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints\\nat once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of\\ncourse that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and\\ncabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter\\nhere in our own country.”\\n\\n“I would not make you unhappy for all the world!” exclaimed Dorothy.\\n“So I’ll just say good-bye.”\\n\\n“Good-bye,” replied the Princess.\\n\\nThey walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and\\nall the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would\\nbreak them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other\\nside of the country and came to another china wall.\\n\\nIt was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the\\nLion’s back they all managed to scramble to the top. Then the Lion\\ngathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he\\njumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to\\npieces.\\n\\n“That was too bad,” said Dorothy, “but really I think we were lucky in\\nnot doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow’s leg and a\\nchurch. They are all so brittle!”\\n\\n“They are, indeed,” said the Scarecrow, “and I am thankful I am made of\\nstraw and cannot be easily damaged. There are worse things in the world\\nthan being a Scarecrow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXI\\nThe Lion Becomes the King of Beasts\\n\\n\\nAfter climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves\\nin a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with\\ntall, rank grass. It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy\\nholes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight. However,\\nby carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they\\nreached solid ground. But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and\\nafter a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered\\nanother forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had\\never seen.\\n\\n“This forest is perfectly delightful,” declared the Lion, looking\\naround him with joy. “Never have I seen a more beautiful place.”\\n\\n“It seems gloomy,” said the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“Not a bit of it,” answered the Lion. “I should like to live here all\\nmy life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich\\nand green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no wild\\nbeast could wish a pleasanter home.”\\n\\n“Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,” said Dorothy.\\n\\n“I suppose there are,” returned the Lion, “but I do not see any of them\\nabout.”\\n\\nThey walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any\\nfarther. Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the\\nWoodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual.\\n\\nWhen morning came, they started again. Before they had gone far they\\nheard a low rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals. Toto\\nwhimpered a little, but none of the others was frightened, and they\\nkept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the\\nwood, in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety. There\\nwere tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the\\nothers in the natural history, and for a moment Dorothy was afraid. But\\nthe Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he\\njudged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble.\\n\\nAs he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once the\\ngreat assemblage hushed as if by magic. The biggest of the tigers came\\nup to the Lion and bowed, saying:\\n\\n“Welcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our\\nenemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more.”\\n\\n“What is your trouble?” asked the Lion quietly.\\n\\n“We are all threatened,” answered the tiger, “by a fierce enemy which\\nhas lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster, like\\na great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a\\ntree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls\\nthrough the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his\\nmouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe\\nwhile this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to\\ndecide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us.”\\n\\nThe Lion thought for a moment.\\n\\n“Are there any other lions in this forest?” he asked.\\n\\n“No; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all. And, besides,\\nthey were none of them nearly so large and brave as you.”\\n\\n“If I put an end to your enemy, will you bow down to me and obey me as\\nKing of the Forest?” inquired the Lion.\\n\\n“We will do that gladly,” returned the tiger; and all the other beasts\\nroared with a mighty roar: “We will!”\\n\\n“Where is this great spider of yours now?” asked the Lion.\\n\\n“Yonder, among the oak trees,” said the tiger, pointing with his\\nforefoot.\\n\\n“Take good care of these friends of mine,” said the Lion, “and I will\\ngo at once to fight the monster.”\\n\\nHe bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle\\nwith the enemy.\\n\\nThe great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it\\nlooked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. Its legs\\nwere quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with\\ncoarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a\\nfoot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as\\nslender as a wasp’s waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to\\nattack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep\\nthan awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the\\nmonster’s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with\\nsharp claws, he knocked the spider’s head from its body. Jumping down,\\nhe watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was\\nquite dead.\\n\\nThe Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were\\nwaiting for him and said proudly:\\n\\n“You need fear your enemy no longer.”\\n\\nThen the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he promised\\nto come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her\\nway to Kansas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXII\\nThe Country of the Quadlings\\n\\n\\nThe four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety, and\\nwhen they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill, covered\\nfrom top to bottom with great pieces of rock.\\n\\n“That will be a hard climb,” said the Scarecrow, “but we must get over\\nthe hill, nevertheless.”\\n\\nSo he led the way and the others followed. They had nearly reached the\\nfirst rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, “Keep back!”\\n\\n“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\nThen a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, “This\\nhill belongs to us, and we don’t allow anyone to cross it.”\\n\\n“But we must cross it,” said the Scarecrow. “We’re going to the country\\nof the Quadlings.”\\n\\n“But you shall not!” replied the voice, and there stepped from behind\\nthe rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.\\n\\nHe was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the\\ntop and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he had no arms\\nat all, and, seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a\\ncreature could prevent them from climbing the hill. So he said, “I’m\\nsorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether\\nyou like it or not,” and he walked boldly forward.\\n\\nAs quick as lightning the man’s head shot forward and his neck\\nstretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the\\nScarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the\\nhill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and\\nthe man laughed harshly as he said, “It isn’t as easy as you think!”\\n\\nA chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy\\nsaw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind\\nevery rock.\\n\\nThe Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow’s\\nmishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up\\nthe hill.\\n\\nAgain a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the\\nhill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball.\\n\\nDorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion\\ncame up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, “It is\\nuseless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand\\nthem.”\\n\\n“What can we do, then?” she asked.\\n\\n“Call the Winged Monkeys,” suggested the Tin Woodman. “You have still\\nthe right to command them once more.”\\n\\n“Very well,” she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered\\nthe magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few\\nmoments the entire band stood before her.\\n\\n“What are your commands?” inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low.\\n\\n“Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,” answered the\\ngirl.\\n\\n“It shall be done,” said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys\\ncaught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with\\nthem. As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with\\nvexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not\\nreach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely\\nover the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the\\nQuadlings.\\n\\n“This is the last time you can summon us,” said the leader to Dorothy;\\n“so good-bye and good luck to you.”\\n\\n“Good-bye, and thank you very much,” returned the girl; and the Monkeys\\nrose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.\\n\\nThe country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy. There was field\\nupon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between,\\nand pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them. The fences\\nand houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had\\nbeen painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the\\ncountry of the Munchkins. The Quadlings themselves, who were short and\\nfat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which\\nshowed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.\\n\\nThe Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers\\nwalked up to it and knocked at the door. It was opened by the farmer’s\\nwife, and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them\\nall a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies,\\nand a bowl of milk for Toto.\\n\\n“How far is it to the Castle of Glinda?” asked the child.\\n\\n“It is not a great way,” answered the farmer’s wife. “Take the road to\\nthe South and you will soon reach it.”\\n\\nThanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields\\nand across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very\\nbeautiful Castle. Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in\\nhandsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy\\napproached, one of them said to her:\\n\\n“Why have you come to the South Country?”\\n\\n“To see the Good Witch who rules here,” she answered. “Will you take me\\nto her?”\\n\\n“Let me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you.”\\nThey told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle.\\nAfter a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others\\nwere to be admitted at once.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXIII\\nGlinda The Good Witch Grants Dorothy’s Wish\\n\\n\\nBefore they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of\\nthe Castle, where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair, and the\\nLion shook the dust out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself\\ninto his best shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his\\njoints.\\n\\nWhen they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl\\ninto a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies.\\n\\nShe was both beautiful and young to their eyes. Her hair was a rich red\\nin color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders. Her dress was\\npure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the\\nlittle girl.\\n\\n“What can I do for you, my child?” she asked.\\n\\nDorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her\\nto the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the\\nwonderful adventures they had met with.\\n\\n“My greatest wish now,” she added, “is to get back to Kansas, for Aunt\\nEm will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that\\nwill make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this\\nyear than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.”\\n\\nGlinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving\\nlittle girl.\\n\\n“Bless your dear heart,” she said, “I am sure I can tell you of a way\\nto get back to Kansas.” Then she added, “But, if I do, you must give me\\nthe Golden Cap.”\\n\\n“Willingly!” exclaimed Dorothy; “indeed, it is of no use to me now, and\\nwhen you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times.”\\n\\n“And I think I shall need their service just those three times,”\\nanswered Glinda, smiling.\\n\\nDorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the\\nScarecrow, “What will you do when Dorothy has left us?”\\n\\n“I will return to the Emerald City,” he replied, “for Oz has made me\\nits ruler and the people like me. The only thing that worries me is how\\nto cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.”\\n\\n“By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry\\nyou to the gates of the Emerald City,” said Glinda, “for it would be a\\nshame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler.”\\n\\n“Am I really wonderful?” asked the Scarecrow.\\n\\n“You are unusual,” replied Glinda.\\n\\nTurning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, “What will become of you when\\nDorothy leaves this country?”\\n\\nHe leaned on his axe and thought a moment. Then he said, “The Winkies\\nwere very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked\\nWitch died. I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to\\nthe Country of the West, I should like nothing better than to rule over\\nthem forever.”\\n\\n“My second command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda “will be that\\nthey carry you safely to the land of the Winkies. Your brain may not be\\nso large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really\\nbrighter than he is—when you are well polished—and I am sure you will\\nrule the Winkies wisely and well.”\\n\\nThen the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked, “When Dorothy\\nhas returned to her own home, what will become of you?”\\n\\n“Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads,” he answered, “lies a grand old\\nforest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King. If\\nI could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily\\nthere.”\\n\\n“My third command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda, “shall be to\\ncarry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of the Golden\\nCap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band\\nmay thereafter be free for evermore.”\\n\\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good\\nWitch earnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed:\\n\\n“You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet\\ntold me how to get back to Kansas.”\\n\\n“Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,” replied Glinda. “If\\nyou had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the\\nvery first day you came to this country.”\\n\\n“But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!” cried the\\nScarecrow. “I might have passed my whole life in the farmer’s\\ncornfield.”\\n\\n“And I should not have had my lovely heart,” said the Tin Woodman. “I\\nmight have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world.”\\n\\n“And I should have lived a coward forever,” declared the Lion, “and no\\nbeast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me.”\\n\\n“This is all true,” said Dorothy, “and I am glad I was of use to these\\ngood friends. But now that each of them has had what he most desired,\\nand each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should\\nlike to go back to Kansas.”\\n\\n“The Silver Shoes,” said the Good Witch, “have wonderful powers. And\\none of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to\\nany place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in\\nthe wink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels together\\nthree times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to\\ngo.”\\n\\n“If that is so,” said the child joyfully, “I will ask them to carry me\\nback to Kansas at once.”\\n\\nShe threw her arms around the Lion’s neck and kissed him, patting his\\nbig head tenderly. Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in\\na way most dangerous to his joints. But she hugged the soft, stuffed\\nbody of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face,\\nand found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her\\nloving comrades.\\n\\nGlinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little\\ngirl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she\\nhad shown to her friends and herself.\\n\\nDorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last\\ngood-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times,\\nsaying:\\n\\n“Take me home to Aunt Em!”\\n\\n\\nInstantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she\\ncould see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears.\\n\\nThe Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly\\nthat she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where\\nshe was.\\n\\nAt length, however, she sat up and looked about her.\\n\\n“Good gracious!” she cried.\\n\\nFor she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her\\nwas the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried\\naway the old one.

I remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself\\nas he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so\\noften afterwards:\\n\\n          “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest--\\n             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”\\n\\nin the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and\\nbroken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of\\nstick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared,\\ncalled roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him,\\nhe drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still\\nlooking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.\\n\\n“This is a handy cove,” says he at length; “and a pleasant sittyated\\ngrog-shop. Much company, mate?”\\n\\nMy father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.\\n\\n“Well, then,” said he, “this is the berth for me. Here you, matey,” he\\ncried to the man who trundled the barrow; “bring up alongside and help\\nup my chest. I’ll stay here a bit,” he continued. “I’m a plain man; rum\\nand bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch\\nships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I\\nsee what you’re at--there”; and he threw down three or four gold pieces\\non the threshold. “You can tell me when I’ve worked through that,” says\\nhe, looking as fierce as a commander.\\n\\nAnd indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none\\nof the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like\\na mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came\\nwith the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at\\nthe Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the\\ncoast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as\\nlonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And\\nthat was all we could learn of our guest.\\n\\nHe was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove or\\nupon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner\\nof the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly\\nhe would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and\\nblow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came\\nabout our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back\\nfrom his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the\\nroad. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind\\nthat made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was\\ndesirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow\\n(as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he\\nwould look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the\\nparlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such\\nwas present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for\\nI was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day\\nand promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I\\nwould only keep my “weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg”\\n and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first\\nof the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only\\nblow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was\\nout he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and\\nrepeat his orders to look out for “the seafaring man with one leg.”\\n\\nHow that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On\\nstormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and\\nthe surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a\\nthousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg\\nwould be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous\\nkind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the\\nmiddle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and\\nditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for\\nmy monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.\\n\\nBut though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one\\nleg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who\\nknew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water\\nthan his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his\\nwicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call\\nfor glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his\\nstories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house\\nshaking with “Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,” all the neighbours joining\\nin for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing\\nlouder than the other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most\\noverriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for\\nsilence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question,\\nor sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not\\nfollowing his story. Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he\\nhad drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed.\\n\\nHis stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories\\nthey were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and\\nthe Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his\\nown account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men\\nthat God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told\\nthese stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the\\ncrimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be\\nruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over\\nand put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his\\npresence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking\\nback they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country\\nlife, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to\\nadmire him, calling him a “true sea-dog” and a “real old salt” and\\nsuch like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England\\nterrible at sea.\\n\\nIn one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week\\nafter week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had\\nbeen long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to\\ninsist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through\\nhis nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor\\nfather out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such a\\nrebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have\\ngreatly hastened his early and unhappy death.\\n\\nAll the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his\\ndress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his\\nhat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it\\nwas a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his\\ncoat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before\\nthe end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter,\\nand he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the\\nmost part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had\\never seen open.\\n\\nHe was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor\\nfather was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr. Livesey came\\nlate one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my\\nmother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should\\ncome down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow. I\\nfollowed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright\\ndoctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and\\npleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all,\\nwith that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting,\\nfar gone in rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he--the captain,\\nthat is--began to pipe up his eternal song:\\n\\n          “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest--\\n             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\\n           Drink and the devil had done for the rest--\\n             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”\\n\\nAt first I had supposed “the dead man’s chest” to be that identical big\\nbox of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled\\nin my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. But by this\\ntime we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it\\nwas new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it\\ndid not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite\\nangrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on\\na new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually\\nbrightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon\\nthe table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The voices\\nstopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey’s; he went on as before speaking\\nclear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or\\ntwo. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again,\\nglared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath,\\n“Silence, there, between decks!”\\n\\n“Were you addressing me, sir?” says the doctor; and when the ruffian had\\ntold him, with another oath, that this was so, “I have only one thing to\\nsay to you, sir,” replies the doctor, “that if you keep on drinking rum,\\nthe world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!”\\n\\nThe old fellow’s fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, drew and opened\\na sailor’s clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand,\\nthreatened to pin the doctor to the wall.\\n\\nThe doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before, over his\\nshoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the\\nroom might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: “If you do not put that\\nknife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall\\nhang at the next assizes.”\\n\\nThen followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon\\nknuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like\\na beaten dog.\\n\\n“And now, sir,” continued the doctor, “since I now know there’s such a\\nfellow in my district, you may count I’ll have an eye upon you day and\\nnight. I’m not a doctor only; I’m a magistrate; and if I catch a breath\\nof complaint against you, if it’s only for a piece of incivility like\\ntonight’s, I’ll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed\\nout of this. Let that suffice.”\\n\\nSoon after, Dr. Livesey’s horse came to the door and he rode away, but\\nthe captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nBlack Dog Appears and Disappears\\n\\n\\nIT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the\\nmysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you\\nwill see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard\\nfrosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor\\nfather was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother\\nand I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without\\npaying much regard to our unpleasant guest.\\n\\nIt was one January morning, very early--a pinching, frosty morning--the\\ncove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones,\\nthe sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to\\nseaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the\\nbeach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat,\\nhis brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I\\nremember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and\\nthe last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort\\nof indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey.\\n\\nWell, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the\\nbreakfast-table against the captain’s return when the parlour door\\nopened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He\\nwas a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and\\nthough he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. I\\nhad always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I\\nremember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a\\nsmack of the sea about him too.\\n\\nI asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but\\nas I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table\\nand motioned me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in my\\nhand.\\n\\n“Come here, sonny,” says he. “Come nearer here.”\\n\\nI took a step nearer.\\n\\n“Is this here table for my mate Bill?” he asked with a kind of leer.\\n\\nI told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person who\\nstayed in our house whom we called the captain.\\n\\n“Well,” said he, “my mate Bill would be called the captain, as like\\nas not. He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him,\\nparticularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We’ll put it, for argument\\nlike, that your captain has a cut on one cheek--and we’ll put it, if you\\nlike, that that cheek’s the right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, is my\\nmate Bill in this here house?”\\n\\nI told him he was out walking.\\n\\n“Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?”\\n\\nAnd when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was\\nlikely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions,\\n“Ah,” said he, “this’ll be as good as drink to my mate Bill.”\\n\\nThe expression of his face as he said these words was not at all\\npleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was\\nmistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of\\nmine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. The\\nstranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the\\ncorner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself into\\nthe road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quick\\nenough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face,\\nand he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I\\nwas back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half\\nsneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had\\ntaken quite a fancy to me. “I have a son of my own,” said he, “as like\\nyou as two blocks, and he’s all the pride of my ’art. But the great\\nthing for boys is discipline, sonny--discipline. Now, if you had sailed\\nalong of Bill, you wouldn’t have stood there to be spoke to twice--not\\nyou. That was never Bill’s way, nor the way of sich as sailed with him.\\nAnd here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm,\\nbless his old ’art, to be sure. You and me’ll just go back into the\\nparlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we’ll give Bill a little\\nsurprise--bless his ’art, I say again.”\\n\\nSo saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me\\nbehind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door. I\\nwas very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my\\nfears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself. He\\ncleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath;\\nand all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt\\nwhat we used to call a lump in the throat.\\n\\nAt last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, without\\nlooking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room to\\nwhere his breakfast awaited him.\\n\\n“Bill,” said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make\\nbold and big.\\n\\nThe captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had\\ngone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a\\nman who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything\\ncan be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn\\nso old and sick.\\n\\n“Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,” said\\nthe stranger.\\n\\nThe captain made a sort of gasp.\\n\\n“Black Dog!” said he.\\n\\n“And who else?” returned the other, getting more at his ease. “Black\\nDog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral\\nBenbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since\\nI lost them two talons,” holding up his mutilated hand.\\n\\n“Now, look here,” said the captain; “you’ve run me down; here I am;\\nwell, then, speak up; what is it?”\\n\\n“That’s you, Bill,” returned Black Dog, “you’re in the right of it,\\nBilly. I’ll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I’ve took\\nsuch a liking to; and we’ll sit down, if you please, and talk square,\\nlike old shipmates.”\\n\\nWhen I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side\\nof the captain’s breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and\\nsitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I\\nthought, on his retreat.\\n\\nHe bade me go and leave the door wide open. “None of your keyholes for\\nme, sonny,” he said; and I left them together and retired into the bar.\\n\\nFor a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen, I could hear\\nnothing but a low gattling; but at last the voices began to grow higher,\\nand I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain.\\n\\n“No, no, no, no; and an end of it!” he cried once. And again, “If it\\ncomes to swinging, swing all, say I.”\\n\\nThen all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and\\nother noises--the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steel\\nfollowed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I saw Black\\nDog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn\\ncutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder. Just\\nat the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous\\ncut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been\\nintercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow. You may see the\\nnotch on the lower side of the frame to this day.\\n\\nThat blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road, Black\\nDog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and\\ndisappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. The captain, for\\nhis part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man. Then he\\npassed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into\\nthe house.\\n\\n“Jim,” says he, “rum”; and as he spoke, he reeled a little, and caught\\nhimself with one hand against the wall.\\n\\n“Are you hurt?” cried I.\\n\\n“Rum,” he repeated. “I must get away from here. Rum! Rum!”\\n\\nI ran to fetch it, but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen\\nout, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while I was still\\ngetting in my own way, I heard a loud fall in the parlour, and running\\nin, beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor. At the same\\ninstant my mother, alarmed by the cries and fighting, came running\\ndownstairs to help me. Between us we raised his head. He was breathing\\nvery loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible\\ncolour.\\n\\n“Dear, deary me,” cried my mother, “what a disgrace upon the house! And\\nyour poor father sick!”\\n\\nIn the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain, nor any\\nother thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with\\nthe stranger. I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his\\nthroat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron.\\nIt was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey\\ncame in, on his visit to my father.\\n\\n“Oh, doctor,” we cried, “what shall we do? Where is he wounded?”\\n\\n“Wounded? A fiddle-stick’s end!” said the doctor. “No more wounded than\\nyou or I. The man has had a stroke, as I warned him. Now, Mrs. Hawkins,\\njust you run upstairs to your husband and tell him, if possible, nothing\\nabout it. For my part, I must do my best to save this fellow’s trebly\\nworthless life; Jim, you get me a basin.”\\n\\nWhen I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the\\ncaptain’s sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. It was tattooed\\nin several places. “Here’s luck,” “A fair wind,” and “Billy Bones his\\nfancy,” were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up\\nnear the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from\\nit--done, as I thought, with great spirit.\\n\\n“Prophetic,” said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger.\\n“And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we’ll have a look at\\nthe colour of your blood. Jim,” he said, “are you afraid of blood?”\\n\\n“No, sir,” said I.\\n\\n“Well, then,” said he, “you hold the basin”; and with that he took his\\nlancet and opened a vein.\\n\\nA great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes\\nand looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with\\nan unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked\\nrelieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise\\nhimself, crying, “Where’s Black Dog?”\\n\\n“There is no Black Dog here,” said the doctor, “except what you have\\non your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke,\\nprecisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will,\\ndragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--”\\n\\n“That’s not my name,” he interrupted.\\n\\n“Much I care,” returned the doctor. “It’s the name of a buccaneer of my\\nacquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I\\nhave to say to you is this; one glass of rum won’t kill you, but if\\nyou take one you’ll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you\\ndon’t break off short, you’ll die--do you understand that?--die, and go\\nto your own place, like the man in the Bible. Come, now, make an effort.\\nI’ll help you to your bed for once.”\\n\\nBetween us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs, and\\nlaid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow as if he\\nwere almost fainting.\\n\\n“Now, mind you,” said the doctor, “I clear my conscience--the name of\\nrum for you is death.”\\n\\nAnd with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him by the\\narm.\\n\\n“This is nothing,” he said as soon as he had closed the door. “I have\\ndrawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a week\\nwhere he is--that is the best thing for him and you; but another stroke\\nwould settle him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nThe Black Spot\\n\\nABOUT noon I stopped at the captain’s door with some cooling drinks\\nand medicines. He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little\\nhigher, and he seemed both weak and excited.\\n\\n“Jim,” he said, “you’re the only one here that’s worth anything, and you\\nknow I’ve been always good to you. Never a month but I’ve given you a\\nsilver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I’m pretty low,\\nand deserted by all; and Jim, you’ll bring me one noggin of rum, now,\\nwon’t you, matey?”\\n\\n“The doctor--” I began.\\n\\nBut he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily.\\n“Doctors is all swabs,” he said; “and that doctor there, why, what do\\nhe know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as pitch, and mates\\ndropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the\\nsea with earthquakes--what to the doctor know of lands like that?--and I\\nlived on rum, I tell you. It’s been meat and drink, and man and wife,\\nto me; and if I’m not to have my rum now I’m a poor old hulk on a lee\\nshore, my blood’ll be on you, Jim, and that doctor swab”; and he ran on\\nagain for a while with curses. “Look, Jim, how my fingers fidges,”\\n he continued in the pleading tone. “I can’t keep ’em still, not I. I\\nhaven’t had a drop this blessed day. That doctor’s a fool, I tell you.\\nIf I don’t have a dram o’ rum, Jim, I’ll have the horrors; I seen some\\non ’em already. I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; as\\nplain as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I’m a man that\\nhas lived rough, and I’ll raise Cain. Your doctor hisself said one glass\\nwouldn’t hurt me. I’ll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim.”\\n\\nHe was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my father,\\nwho was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, I was reassured by\\nthe doctor’s words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer\\nof a bribe.\\n\\n“I want none of your money,” said I, “but what you owe my father. I’ll\\nget you one glass, and no more.”\\n\\nWhen I brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it out.\\n\\n“Aye, aye,” said he, “that’s some better, sure enough. And now, matey,\\ndid that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?”\\n\\n“A week at least,” said I.\\n\\n“Thunder!” he cried. “A week! I can’t do that; they’d have the black\\nspot on me by then. The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me\\nthis blessed moment; lubbers as couldn’t keep what they got, and want to\\nnail what is another’s. Is that seamanly behaviour, now, I want to know?\\nBut I’m a saving soul. I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it\\nneither; and I’ll trick ’em again. I’m not afraid on ’em. I’ll shake out\\nanother reef, matey, and daddle ’em again.”\\n\\nAs he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty,\\nholding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, and\\nmoving his legs like so much dead weight. His words, spirited as they\\nwere in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in\\nwhich they were uttered. He paused when he had got into a sitting\\nposition on the edge.\\n\\n“That doctor’s done me,” he murmured. “My ears is singing. Lay me back.”\\n\\nBefore I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his\\nformer place, where he lay for a while silent.\\n\\n“Jim,” he said at length, “you saw that seafaring man today?”\\n\\n“Black Dog?” I asked.\\n\\n“Ah! Black Dog,” says he. “HE’S a bad un; but there’s worse that put him\\non. Now, if I can’t get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind\\nyou, it’s my old sea-chest they’re after; you get on a horse--you can,\\ncan’t you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes,\\nI will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all\\nhands--magistrates and sich--and he’ll lay ’em aboard at the Admiral\\nBenbow--all old Flint’s crew, man and boy, all on ’em that’s left. I was\\nfirst mate, I was, old Flint’s first mate, and I’m the on’y one as knows\\nthe place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I\\nwas to now, you see. But you won’t peach unless they get the black spot\\non me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with\\none leg, Jim--him above all.”\\n\\n“But what is the black spot, captain?” I asked.\\n\\n“That’s a summons, mate. I’ll tell you if they get that. But you keep\\nyour weather-eye open, Jim, and I’ll share with you equals, upon my\\nhonour.”\\n\\nHe wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I\\nhad given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark,\\n“If ever a seaman wanted drugs, it’s me,” he fell at last into a heavy,\\nswoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I should have done had all\\ngone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story to\\nthe doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of\\nhis confessions and make an end of me. But as things fell out, my poor\\nfather died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters\\non one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the\\narranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on\\nin the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of\\nthe captain, far less to be afraid of him.\\n\\nHe got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual,\\nthough he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of\\nrum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through\\nhis nose, and no one dared to cross him. On the night before the funeral\\nhe was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in that house of mourning,\\nto hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was,\\nwe were all in the fear of death for him, and the doctor was suddenly\\ntaken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after\\nmy father’s death. I have said the captain was weak, and indeed he\\nseemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength. He clambered up\\nand down stairs, and went from the parlour to the bar and back again,\\nand sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to\\nthe walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man\\non a steep mountain. He never particularly addressed me, and it is my\\nbelief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was\\nmore flighty, and allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent than\\never. He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his\\ncutlass and laying it bare before him on the table. But with all that,\\nhe minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather\\nwandering. Once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a\\ndifferent air, a kind of country love-song that he must have learned in\\nhis youth before he had begun to follow the sea.\\n\\nSo things passed until, the day after the funeral, and about three\\no’clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was standing at the door\\nfor a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father, when I saw someone\\ndrawing slowly near along the road. He was plainly blind, for he tapped\\nbefore him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and\\nnose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge\\nold tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positively\\ndeformed. I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure.\\nHe stopped a little from the inn, and raising his voice in an odd\\nsing-song, addressed the air in front of him, “Will any kind friend\\ninform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in\\nthe gracious defence of his native country, England--and God bless King\\nGeorge!--where or in what part of this country he may now be?”\\n\\n“You are at the Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, my good man,” said I.\\n\\n“I hear a voice,” said he, “a young voice. Will you give me your hand,\\nmy kind young friend, and lead me in?”\\n\\nI held out my hand, and the horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless creature\\ngripped it in a moment like a vise. I was so much startled that I\\nstruggled to withdraw, but the blind man pulled me close up to him with\\na single action of his arm.\\n\\n“Now, boy,” he said, “take me in to the captain.”\\n\\n“Sir,” said I, “upon my word I dare not.”\\n\\n“Oh,” he sneered, “that’s it! Take me in straight or I’ll break your\\narm.”\\n\\nAnd he gave it, as he spoke, a wrench that made me cry out.\\n\\n“Sir,” said I, “it is for yourself I mean. The captain is not what he\\nused to be. He sits with a drawn cutlass. Another gentleman--”\\n\\n“Come, now, march,” interrupted he; and I never heard a voice so cruel,\\nand cold, and ugly as that blind man’s. It cowed me more than the pain,\\nand I began to obey him at once, walking straight in at the door and\\ntowards the parlour, where our sick old buccaneer was sitting, dazed\\nwith rum. The blind man clung close to me, holding me in one iron fist\\nand leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry. “Lead me\\nstraight up to him, and when I’m in view, cry out, ‘Here’s a friend\\nfor you, Bill.’ If you don’t, I’ll do this,” and with that he gave me a\\ntwitch that I thought would have made me faint. Between this and that, I\\nwas so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of\\nthe captain, and as I opened the parlour door, cried out the words he\\nhad ordered in a trembling voice.\\n\\nThe poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the rum went out of\\nhim and left him staring sober. The expression of his face was not so\\nmuch of terror as of mortal sickness. He made a movement to rise, but I\\ndo not believe he had enough force left in his body.\\n\\n“Now, Bill, sit where you are,” said the beggar. “If I can’t see, I can\\nhear a finger stirring. Business is business. Hold out your left hand.\\nBoy, take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right.”\\n\\nWe both obeyed him to the letter, and I saw him pass something from the\\nhollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain’s,\\nwhich closed upon it instantly.\\n\\n“And now that’s done,” said the blind man; and at the words he suddenly\\nleft hold of me, and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness,\\nskipped out of the parlour and into the road, where, as I still stood\\nmotionless, I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance.\\n\\nIt was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our\\nsenses, but at length, and about at the same moment, I released his\\nwrist, which I was still holding, and he drew in his hand and looked\\nsharply into the palm.\\n\\n“Ten o’clock!” he cried. “Six hours. We’ll do them yet,” and he sprang\\nto his feet.\\n\\nEven as he did so, he reeled, put his hand to his throat, stood swaying\\nfor a moment, and then, with a peculiar sound, fell from his whole\\nheight face foremost to the floor.\\n\\nI ran to him at once, calling to my mother. But haste was all in vain.\\nThe captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy. It is a curious\\nthing to understand, for I had certainly never liked the man, though of\\nlate I had begun to pity him, but as soon as I saw that he was dead, I\\nburst into a flood of tears. It was the second death I had known, and\\nthe sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nThe Sea-chest\\n\\nI LOST no time, of course, in telling my mother all that I knew, and\\nperhaps should have told her long before, and we saw ourselves at once\\nin a difficult and dangerous position. Some of the man’s money--if\\nhe had any--was certainly due to us, but it was not likely that our\\ncaptain’s shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me, Black\\nDog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty in\\npayment of the dead man’s debts. The captain’s order to mount at\\nonce and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my mother alone\\nand unprotected, which was not to be thought of. Indeed, it seemed\\nimpossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the fall\\nof coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled\\nus with alarms. The neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by\\napproaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of the captain\\non the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar\\nhovering near at hand and ready to return, there were moments when, as\\nthe saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror. Something must speedily\\nbe resolved upon, and it occurred to us at last to go forth together\\nand seek help in the neighbouring hamlet. No sooner said than done.\\nBare-headed as we were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and\\nthe frosty fog.\\n\\nThe hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though out of view, on the\\nother side of the next cove; and what greatly encouraged me, it was\\nin an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his\\nappearance and whither he had presumably returned. We were not many\\nminutes on the road, though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each\\nother and hearken. But there was no unusual sound--nothing but the low\\nwash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood.\\n\\nIt was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet, and I shall\\nnever forget how much I was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and\\nwindows; but that, as it proved, was the best of the help we were likely\\nto get in that quarter. For--you would have thought men would have been\\nashamed of themselves--no soul would consent to return with us to the\\nAdmiral Benbow. The more we told of our troubles, the more--man, woman,\\nand child--they clung to the shelter of their houses. The name of\\nCaptain Flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known to\\nsome there and carried a great weight of terror. Some of the men who\\nhad been to field-work on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remembered,\\nbesides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to\\nbe smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little\\nlugger in what we called Kitt’s Hole. For that matter, anyone who was a\\ncomrade of the captain’s was enough to frighten them to death. And the\\nshort and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several\\nwho were willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey’s, which lay in another\\ndirection, not one would help us to defend the inn.\\n\\nThey say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other\\nhand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother\\nmade them a speech. She would not, she declared, lose money that\\nbelonged to her fatherless boy; “If none of the rest of you dare,”\\n she said, “Jim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we came, and small\\nthanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. We’ll have that chest\\nopen, if we die for it. And I’ll thank you for that bag, Mrs. Crossley,\\nto bring back our lawful money in.”\\n\\nOf course I said I would go with my mother, and of course they all cried\\nout at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would go along with\\nus. All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were\\nattacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were\\npursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor’s\\nin search of armed assistance.\\n\\nMy heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon\\nthis dangerous venture. A full moon was beginning to rise and peered\\nredly through the upper edges of the fog, and this increased our haste,\\nfor it was plain, before we came forth again, that all would be as\\nbright as day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers.\\nWe slipped along the hedges, noiseless and swift, nor did we see or hear\\nanything to increase our terrors, till, to our relief, the door of the\\nAdmiral Benbow had closed behind us.\\n\\nI slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for a moment in the\\ndark, alone in the house with the dead captain’s body. Then my mother\\ngot a candle in the bar, and holding each other’s hands, we advanced\\ninto the parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes\\nopen and one arm stretched out.\\n\\n“Draw down the blind, Jim,” whispered my mother; “they might come and\\nwatch outside. And now,” said she when I had done so, “we have to get\\nthe key off THAT; and who’s to touch it, I should like to know!” and she\\ngave a kind of sob as she said the words.\\n\\nI went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to his hand there\\nwas a little round of paper, blackened on the one side. I could not\\ndoubt that this was the BLACK SPOT; and taking it up, I found written\\non the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this short message: “You\\nhave till ten tonight.”\\n\\n“He had till ten, Mother,” said I; and just as I said it, our old clock\\nbegan striking. This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news\\nwas good, for it was only six.\\n\\n“Now, Jim,” she said, “that key.”\\n\\nI felt in his pockets, one after another. A few small coins, a thimble,\\nand some thread and big needles, a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away\\nat the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a\\ntinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair.\\n\\n“Perhaps it’s round his neck,” suggested my mother.\\n\\nOvercoming a strong repugnance, I tore open his shirt at the neck, and\\nthere, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry string, which I cut with\\nhis own gully, we found the key. At this triumph we were filled with\\nhope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had\\nslept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival.\\n\\nIt was like any other seaman’s chest on the outside, the initial “B”\\n burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the corners somewhat\\nsmashed and broken as by long, rough usage.\\n\\n“Give me the key,” said my mother; and though the lock was very stiff,\\nshe had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling.\\n\\nA strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior, but nothing\\nwas to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes, carefully\\nbrushed and folded. They had never been worn, my mother said. Under\\nthat, the miscellany began--a quadrant, a tin canikin, several sticks of\\ntobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an\\nold Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of\\nforeign make, a pair of compasses mounted with brass, and five or six\\ncurious West Indian shells. I have often wondered since why he should\\nhave carried about these shells with him in his wandering, guilty, and\\nhunted life.\\n\\nIn the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but the silver and\\nthe trinkets, and neither of these were in our way. Underneath there\\nwas an old boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar. My\\nmother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last\\nthings in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like\\npapers, and a canvas bag that gave forth, at a touch, the jingle of\\ngold.\\n\\n“I’ll show these rogues that I’m an honest woman,” said my mother. “I’ll\\nhave my dues, and not a farthing over. Hold Mrs. Crossley’s bag.” And\\nshe began to count over the amount of the captain’s score from the\\nsailor’s bag into the one that I was holding.\\n\\nIt was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries\\nand sizes--doubloons, and louis d’ors, and guineas, and pieces of eight,\\nand I know not what besides, all shaken together at random. The guineas,\\ntoo, were about the scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother\\nknew how to make her count.\\n\\nWhen we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her\\narm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my\\nheart into my mouth--the tap-tapping of the blind man’s stick upon the\\nfrozen road. It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath.\\nThen it struck sharp on the inn door, and then we could hear the handle\\nbeing turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter;\\nand then there was a long time of silence both within and without.\\nAt last the tapping recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and\\ngratitude, died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard.\\n\\n“Mother,” said I, “take the whole and let’s be going,” for I was sure\\nthe bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole\\nhornet’s nest about our ears, though how thankful I was that I had\\nbolted it, none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man.\\n\\nBut my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent to take a\\nfraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be\\ncontent with less. It was not yet seven, she said, by a long way; she\\nknew her rights and she would have them; and she was still arguing with\\nme when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill. That\\nwas enough, and more than enough, for both of us.\\n\\n“I’ll take what I have,” she said, jumping to her feet.\\n\\n“And I’ll take this to square the count,” said I, picking up the oilskin\\npacket.\\n\\nNext moment we were both groping downstairs, leaving the candle by\\nthe empty chest; and the next we had opened the door and were in full\\nretreat. We had not started a moment too soon. The fog was rapidly\\ndispersing; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on\\neither side; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round\\nthe tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the\\nfirst steps of our escape. Far less than half-way to the hamlet, very\\nlittle beyond the bottom of the hill, we must come forth into the\\nmoonlight. Nor was this all, for the sound of several footsteps running\\ncame already to our ears, and as we looked back in their direction, a\\nlight tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of\\nthe newcomers carried a lantern.\\n\\n“My dear,” said my mother suddenly, “take the money and run on. I am\\ngoing to faint.”\\n\\nThis was certainly the end for both of us, I thought. How I cursed the\\ncowardice of the neighbours; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty\\nand her greed, for her past foolhardiness and present weakness! We were\\njust at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her, tottering\\nas she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh\\nand fell on my shoulder. I do not know how I found the strength to do it\\nat all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her\\ndown the bank and a little way under the arch. Farther I could not move\\nher, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it.\\nSo there we had to stay--my mother almost entirely exposed and both of\\nus within earshot of the inn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nThe Last of the Blind Man\\n\\nMY curiosity, in a sense, was stronger than my fear, for I could not\\nremain where I was, but crept back to the bank again, whence, sheltering\\nmy head behind a bush of broom, I might command the road before our\\ndoor. I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven\\nor eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along\\nthe road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three men ran\\ntogether, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the mist, that the\\nmiddle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The next moment his voice\\nshowed me that I was right.\\n\\n“Down with the door!” he cried.\\n\\n“Aye, aye, sir!” answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the\\nAdmiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see\\nthem pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were\\nsurprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind\\nman again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as\\nif he were afire with eagerness and rage.\\n\\n“In, in, in!” he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\\n\\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the\\nformidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a\\nvoice shouting from the house, “Bill’s dead.”\\n\\nBut the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\\n\\n“Search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and\\nget the chest,” he cried.\\n\\nI could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the\\nhouse must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of\\nastonishment arose; the window of the captain’s room was thrown open\\nwith a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the\\nmoonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the\\nroad below him.\\n\\n“Pew,” he cried, “they’ve been before us. Someone’s turned the chest out\\nalow and aloft.”\\n\\n“Is it there?” roared Pew.\\n\\n“The money’s there.”\\n\\nThe blind man cursed the money.\\n\\n“Flint’s fist, I mean,” he cried.\\n\\n“We don’t see it here nohow,” returned the man.\\n\\n“Here, you below there, is it on Bill?” cried the blind man again.\\n\\nAt that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search\\nthe captain’s body, came to the door of the inn. “Bill’s been overhauled\\na’ready,” said he; “nothin’ left.”\\n\\n“It’s these people of the inn--it’s that boy. I wish I had put his eyes\\nout!” cried the blind man, Pew. “There were no time ago--they had the\\ndoor bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find ’em.”\\n\\n“Sure enough, they left their glim here,” said the fellow from the\\nwindow.\\n\\n“Scatter and find ’em! Rout the house out!” reiterated Pew, striking\\nwith his stick upon the road.\\n\\nThen there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet\\npounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the\\nvery rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on\\nthe road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just\\nthe same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead\\ncaptain’s money was once more clearly audible through the night,\\nbut this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man’s\\ntrumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found\\nthat it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its\\neffect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\\n\\n“There’s Dirk again,” said one. “Twice! We’ll have to budge, mates.”\\n\\n“Budge, you skulk!” cried Pew. “Dirk was a fool and a coward from the\\nfirst--you wouldn’t mind him. They must be close by; they can’t be far;\\nyou have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver\\nmy soul,” he cried, “if I had eyes!”\\n\\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began\\nto look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought,\\nand with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest\\nstood irresolute on the road.\\n\\n“You have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You’d\\nbe as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it’s here, and\\nyou stand there skulking. There wasn’t one of you dared face Bill, and\\nI did it--a blind man! And I’m to lose my chance for you! I’m to be a\\npoor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a\\ncoach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch\\nthem still.”\\n\\n“Hang it, Pew, we’ve got the doubloons!” grumbled one.\\n\\n“They might have hid the blessed thing,” said another. “Take the\\nGeorges, Pew, and don’t stand here squalling.”\\n\\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew’s anger rose so high at these\\nobjections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand,\\nhe struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded\\nheavily on more than one.\\n\\nThese, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him\\nin horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from\\nhis grasp.\\n\\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging,\\nanother sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the\\nhamlet--the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a\\npistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was\\nplainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once\\nand ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one\\nslant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of\\nthem remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic\\nor out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he\\nremained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping\\nand calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few\\nsteps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, “Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,”\\n and other names, “you won’t leave old Pew, mates--not old Pew!”\\n\\nJust then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders\\ncame in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\\n\\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for\\nthe ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a\\nsecond and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the\\nnearest of the coming horses.\\n\\nThe rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that\\nrang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him\\nand passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face\\nand moved no more.\\n\\nI leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any\\nrate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One,\\ntailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to\\nDr. Livesey’s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the\\nway, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some\\nnews of the lugger in Kitt’s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance\\nand set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance\\nmy mother and I owed our preservation from death.\\n\\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up\\nto the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her\\nback again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still\\ncontinued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the\\nsupervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt’s Hole; but his men\\nhad to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes\\nsupporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was\\nno great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the\\nlugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A\\nvoice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get\\nsome lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his\\narm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance\\nstood there, as he said, “like a fish out of water,” and all he could do\\nwas to dispatch a man to B---- to warn the cutter. “And that,” said he,\\n“is just about as good as nothing. They’ve got off clean, and there’s\\nan end. Only,” he added, “I’m glad I trod on Master Pew’s corns,” for by\\nthis time he had heard my story.\\n\\nI went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a\\nhouse in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down\\nby these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself;\\nand though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain’s\\nmoney-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we\\nwere ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.\\n\\n“They got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were\\nthey after? More money, I suppose?”\\n\\n“No, sir; not money, I think,” replied I. “In fact, sir, I believe I\\nhave the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should\\nlike to get it put in safety.”\\n\\n“To be sure, boy; quite right,” said he. “I’ll take it, if you like.”\\n\\n“I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey--” I began.\\n\\n“Perfectly right,” he interrupted very cheerily, “perfectly right--a\\ngentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as\\nwell ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew’s\\ndead, when all’s done; not that I regret it, but he’s dead, you see, and\\npeople will make it out against an officer of his Majesty’s revenue,\\nif make it out they can. Now, I’ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I’ll\\ntake you along.”\\n\\nI thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet\\nwhere the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they\\nwere all in the saddle.\\n\\n“Dogger,” said Mr. Dance, “you have a good horse; take up this lad\\nbehind you.”\\n\\nAs soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger’s belt, the supervisor\\ngave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road\\nto Dr. Livesey’s house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nThe Captain’s Papers\\n\\nWE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey’s door. The\\nhouse was all dark to the front.\\n\\nMr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup\\nto descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid.\\n\\n“Is Dr. Livesey in?” I asked.\\n\\nNo, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the\\nhall to dine and pass the evening with the squire.\\n\\n“So there we go, boys,” said Mr. Dance.\\n\\nThis time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with\\nDogger’s stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless,\\nmoonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on\\neither hand on great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and taking\\nme along with him, was admitted at a word into the house.\\n\\nThe servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a\\ngreat library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them,\\nwhere the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a\\nbright fire.\\n\\nI had never seen the squire so near at hand. He was a tall man, over six\\nfeet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff, rough-and-ready\\nface, all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels. His\\neyebrows were very black, and moved readily, and this gave him a look of\\nsome temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high.\\n\\n“Come in, Mr. Dance,” says he, very stately and condescending.\\n\\n“Good evening, Dance,” says the doctor with a nod. “And good evening to\\nyou, friend Jim. What good wind brings you here?”\\n\\nThe supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a\\nlesson; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward\\nand looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and\\ninterest. When they heard how my mother went back to the inn, Dr.\\nLivesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried “Bravo!” and\\nbroke his long pipe against the grate. Long before it was done, Mr.\\nTrelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire’s name) had got up\\nfrom his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to\\nhear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking\\nvery strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll.\\n\\nAt last Mr. Dance finished the story.\\n\\n“Mr. Dance,” said the squire, “you are a very noble fellow. And as for\\nriding down that black, atrocious miscreant, I regard it as an act of\\nvirtue, sir, like stamping on a cockroach. This lad Hawkins is a trump,\\nI perceive. Hawkins, will you ring that bell? Mr. Dance must have some\\nale.”\\n\\n“And so, Jim,” said the doctor, “you have the thing that they were\\nafter, have you?”\\n\\n“Here it is, sir,” said I, and gave him the oilskin packet.\\n\\nThe doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to open\\nit; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his\\ncoat.\\n\\n“Squire,” said he, “when Dance has had his ale he must, of course, be\\noff on his Majesty’s service; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to\\nsleep at my house, and with your permission, I propose we should have up\\nthe cold pie and let him sup.”\\n\\n“As you will, Livesey,” said the squire; “Hawkins has earned better than\\ncold pie.”\\n\\nSo a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable, and I made\\na hearty supper, for I was as hungry as a hawk, while Mr. Dance was\\nfurther complimented and at last dismissed.\\n\\n“And now, squire,” said the doctor.\\n\\n“And now, Livesey,” said the squire in the same breath.\\n\\n“One at a time, one at a time,” laughed Dr. Livesey. “You have heard of\\nthis Flint, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Heard of him!” cried the squire. “Heard of him, you say! He was the\\nbloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed. Blackbeard was a child to Flint.\\nThe Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir,\\nI was sometimes proud he was an Englishman. I’ve seen his top-sails with\\nthese eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I\\nsailed with put back--put back, sir, into Port of Spain.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ve heard of him myself, in England,” said the doctor. “But the\\npoint is, had he money?”\\n\\n“Money!” cried the squire. “Have you heard the story? What were these\\nvillains after but money? What do they care for but money? For what\\nwould they risk their rascal carcasses but money?”\\n\\n“That we shall soon know,” replied the doctor. “But you are so\\nconfoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in.\\nWhat I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket\\nsome clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount\\nto much?”\\n\\n“Amount, sir!” cried the squire. “It will amount to this: If we have the\\nclue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and\\nHawkins here along, and I’ll have that treasure if I search a year.”\\n\\n“Very well,” said the doctor. “Now, then, if Jim is agreeable, we’ll\\nopen the packet”; and he laid it before him on the table.\\n\\nThe bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his\\ninstrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. It\\ncontained two things--a book and a sealed paper.\\n\\n“First of all we’ll try the book,” observed the doctor.\\n\\nThe squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened\\nit, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the\\nside-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search.\\nOn the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man\\nwith a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the\\nsame as the tattoo mark, “Billy Bones his fancy”; then there was “Mr. W.\\nBones, mate,” “No more rum,” “Off Palm Key he got itt,” and some other\\nsnatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. I could not help\\nwondering who it was that had “got itt,” and what “itt” was that he got.\\nA knife in his back as like as not.\\n\\n“Not much instruction there,” said Dr. Livesey as he passed on.\\n\\nThe next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of\\nentries. There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a\\nsum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory\\nwriting, only a varying number of crosses between the two. On the 12th\\nof June, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become\\ndue to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the\\ncause. In a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added,\\nas “Offe Caraccas,” or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as “62o\\n17′ 20″, 19o 2′ 40″.”\\n\\nThe record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate\\nentries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total\\nhad been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words\\nappended, “Bones, his pile.”\\n\\n“I can’t make head or tail of this,” said Dr. Livesey.\\n\\n“The thing is as clear as noonday,” cried the squire. “This is the\\nblack-hearted hound’s account-book. These crosses stand for the names of\\nships or towns that they sank or plundered. The sums are the scoundrel’s\\nshare, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something\\nclearer. ‘Offe Caraccas,’ now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel\\nboarded off that coast. God help the poor souls that manned her--coral\\nlong ago.”\\n\\n“Right!” said the doctor. “See what it is to be a traveller. Right! And\\nthe amounts increase, you see, as he rose in rank.”\\n\\nThere was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted\\nin the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French,\\nEnglish, and Spanish moneys to a common value.\\n\\n“Thrifty man!” cried the doctor. “He wasn’t the one to be cheated.”\\n\\n“And now,” said the squire, “for the other.”\\n\\nThe paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of\\nseal; the very thimble, perhaps, that I had found in the captain’s\\npocket. The doctor opened the seals with great care, and there fell out\\nthe map of an island, with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of\\nhills and bays and inlets, and every particular that would be needed\\nto bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores. It was about nine\\nmiles long and five across, shaped, you might say, like a fat dragon\\nstanding up, and had two fine land-locked harbours, and a hill in the\\ncentre part marked “The Spy-glass.” There were several additions of a\\nlater date, but above all, three crosses of red ink--two on the north\\npart of the island, one in the southwest--and beside this last, in\\nthe same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very different from the\\ncaptain’s tottery characters, these words: “Bulk of treasure here.”\\n\\nOver on the back the same hand had written this further information:\\n\\n     Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to\\n     the N. of N.N.E.\\n\\n     Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.\\n\\n     Ten feet.\\n\\n     The bar silver is in the north cache; you can find\\n     it by the trend of the east hummock, ten fathoms\\n     south of the black crag with the face on it.\\n\\n     The arms are easy found, in the sand-hill, N.\\n     point of north inlet cape, bearing E. and a\\n     quarter N.\\n     J.F.\\n\\nThat was all; but brief as it was, and to me incomprehensible, it filled\\nthe squire and Dr. Livesey with delight.\\n\\n“Livesey,” said the squire, “you will give up this wretched practice\\nat once. Tomorrow I start for Bristol. In three weeks’ time--three\\nweeks!--two weeks--ten days--we’ll have the best ship, sir, and the\\nchoicest crew in England. Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy. You’ll make\\na famous cabin-boy, Hawkins. You, Livesey, are ship’s doctor; I am\\nadmiral. We’ll take Redruth, Joyce, and Hunter. We’ll have favourable\\nwinds, a quick passage, and not the least difficulty in finding the\\nspot, and money to eat, to roll in, to play duck and drake with ever\\nafter.”\\n\\n“Trelawney,” said the doctor, “I’ll go with you; and I’ll go bail for\\nit, so will Jim, and be a credit to the undertaking. There’s only one\\nman I’m afraid of.”\\n\\n“And who’s that?” cried the squire. “Name the dog, sir!”\\n\\n“You,” replied the doctor; “for you cannot hold your tongue. We are not\\nthe only men who know of this paper. These fellows who attacked the\\ninn tonight--bold, desperate blades, for sure--and the rest who stayed\\naboard that lugger, and more, I dare say, not far off, are, one and all,\\nthrough thick and thin, bound that they’ll get that money. We must none\\nof us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the\\nmeanwhile; you’ll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and\\nfrom first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we’ve\\nfound.”\\n\\n“Livesey,” returned the squire, “you are always in the right of it. I’ll\\nbe as silent as the grave.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART TWO--The Sea-cook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nI Go to Bristol\\n\\nIT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea,\\nand none of our first plans--not even Dr. Livesey’s, of keeping me\\nbeside him--could be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go\\nto London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was\\nhard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of\\nold Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams\\nand the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures.\\nI brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which\\nI well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper’s room, I\\napproached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I\\nexplored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that\\ntall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most\\nwonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with\\nsavages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that\\nhunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and\\ntragic as our actual adventures.\\n\\nSo the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed\\nto Dr. Livesey, with this addition, “To be opened, in the case of his\\nabsence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.” Obeying this order, we\\nfound, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading\\nanything but print--the following important news:\\n\\n     Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17--\\n\\n     Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you\\n     are at the hall or still in London, I send this in\\n     double to both places.\\n\\n     The ship is bought and fitted.  She lies at\\n     anchor, ready for sea.  You never imagined a\\n     sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two\\n     hundred tons; name, HISPANIOLA.\\n\\n     I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who\\n     has proved himself throughout the most surprising\\n     trump.  The admirable fellow literally slaved in\\n     my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in\\n     Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we\\n     sailed for--treasure, I mean.\\n\\n“Redruth,” said I, interrupting the letter, “Dr. Livesey will not like\\nthat. The squire has been talking, after all.”\\n\\n“Well, who’s a better right?” growled the gamekeeper. “A pretty rum go\\nif squire ain’t to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should think.”\\n\\nAt that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on:\\n\\n     Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA, and\\n     by the most admirable management got her for the\\n     merest trifle.  There is a class of men in Bristol\\n     monstrously prejudiced against Blandly.  They go\\n     the length of declaring that this honest creature\\n     would do anything for money, that the HISPANIOLA\\n     belonged to him, and that he sold it me absurdly\\n     high--the most transparent calumnies.  None of them\\n     dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship.\\n\\n     So far there was not a hitch.  The\\n     workpeople, to be sure--riggers and what not--were\\n     most annoyingly slow; but time cured that.  It was\\n     the crew that troubled me.\\n\\n     I wished a round score of men--in case of\\n     natives, buccaneers, or the odious French--and I\\n     had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much\\n     as half a dozen, till the most remarkable stroke\\n     of fortune brought me the very man that I\\n     required.\\n\\n     I was standing on the dock, when, by the\\n     merest accident, I fell in talk with him.  I found\\n     he was an old sailor, kept a public-house, knew\\n     all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost his\\n     health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to\\n     get to sea again.  He had hobbled down there that\\n     morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.\\n\\n     I was monstrously touched--so would you have\\n     been--and, out of pure pity, I engaged him on the\\n     spot to be ship’s cook.  Long John Silver, he is\\n     called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as\\n     a recommendation, since he lost it in his\\n     country’s service, under the immortal Hawke.  He\\n     has no pension, Livesey.  Imagine the abominable\\n     age we live in!\\n\\n     Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook,\\n     but it was a crew I had discovered.  Between\\n     Silver and myself we got together in a few days a\\n     company of the toughest old salts imaginable--not\\n     pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of\\n     the most indomitable spirit.  I declare we could\\n     fight a frigate.\\n\\n     Long John even got rid of two out of the six\\n     or seven I had already engaged.  He showed me in a\\n     moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water\\n     swabs we had to fear in an adventure of\\n     importance.\\n\\n     I am in the most magnificent health and\\n     spirits, eating like a bull, sleeping like a tree,\\n     yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old\\n     tarpaulins tramping round the capstan.  Seaward,\\n     ho!  Hang the treasure!  It’s the glory of the sea\\n     that has turned my head.  So now, Livesey, come\\n     post; do not lose an hour, if you respect me.\\n\\n     Let young Hawkins go at once to see his\\n     mother, with Redruth for a guard; and then both\\n     come full speed to Bristol.\\n     John Trelawney\\n\\n     Postscript--I did not tell you that Blandly,\\n     who, by the way, is to send a consort after us if\\n     we don’t turn up by the end of August, had found\\n     an admirable fellow for sailing master--a stiff\\n     man, which I regret, but in all other respects a\\n     treasure.  Long John Silver unearthed a very\\n     competent man for a mate, a man named Arrow.  I\\n     have a boatswain who pipes, Livesey; so things\\n     shall go man-o’-war fashion on board the good ship\\n     HISPANIOLA.\\n\\n     I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of\\n     substance; I know of my own knowledge that he has\\n     a banker’s account, which has never been\\n     overdrawn.  He leaves his wife to manage the inn;\\n     and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old\\n     bachelors like you and I may be excused for\\n     guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the\\n     health, that sends him back to roving.\\n     J. T.\\n\\n     P.P.S.--Hawkins may stay one night with his\\n     mother.\\n     J. T.\\n\\nYou can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I was half\\nbeside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it was old\\nTom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. Any of the\\nunder-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such\\nwas not the squire’s pleasure, and the squire’s pleasure was like law\\namong them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even\\nto grumble.\\n\\nThe next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow, and\\nthere I found my mother in good health and spirits. The captain, who had\\nso long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked\\ncease from troubling. The squire had had everything repaired, and the\\npublic rooms and the sign repainted, and had added some furniture--above\\nall a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar. He had found her a boy\\nas an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone.\\n\\nIt was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time, my\\nsituation. I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me,\\nnot at all of the home that I was leaving; and now, at sight of this\\nclumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, I\\nhad my first attack of tears. I am afraid I led that boy a dog’s life,\\nfor as he was new to the work, I had a hundred opportunities of setting\\nhim right and putting him down, and I was not slow to profit by them.\\n\\nThe night passed, and the next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were\\nafoot again and on the road. I said good-bye to Mother and the\\ncove where I had lived since I was born, and the dear old Admiral\\nBenbow--since he was repainted, no longer quite so dear. One of my last\\nthoughts was of the captain, who had so often strode along the beach\\nwith his cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope.\\nNext moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight.\\n\\nThe mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath. I was\\nwedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of the\\nswift motion and the cold night air, I must have dozed a great deal from\\nthe very first, and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through\\nstage after stage, for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch\\nin the ribs, and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still\\nbefore a large building in a city street and that the day had already\\nbroken a long time.\\n\\n“Where are we?” I asked.\\n\\n“Bristol,” said Tom. “Get down.”\\n\\nMr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to\\nsuperintend the work upon the schooner. Thither we had now to walk, and\\nour way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the great\\nmultitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations. In one, sailors\\nwere singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over\\nmy head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider’s.\\nThough I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been\\nnear the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new.\\nI saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the\\nocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and\\nwhiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering,\\nclumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could\\nnot have been more delighted.\\n\\nAnd I was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a piping\\nboatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for an unknown\\nisland, and to seek for buried treasure!\\n\\nWhile I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front\\nof a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a\\nsea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on\\nhis face and a capital imitation of a sailor’s walk.\\n\\n“Here you are,” he cried, “and the doctor came last night from London.\\nBravo! The ship’s company complete!”\\n\\n“Oh, sir,” cried I, “when do we sail?”\\n\\n“Sail!” says he. “We sail tomorrow!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nAt the Sign of the Spy-glass\\n\\nWHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John\\nSilver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily\\nfind the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright\\nlookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign. I\\nset off, overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and\\nseamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and\\nbales, for the dock was now at its busiest, until I found the tavern in\\nquestion.\\n\\nIt was a bright enough little place of entertainment. The sign was\\nnewly painted; the windows had neat red curtains; the floor was cleanly\\nsanded. There was a street on each side and an open door on both, which\\nmade the large, low room pretty clear to see in, in spite of clouds of\\ntobacco smoke.\\n\\nThe customers were mostly seafaring men, and they talked so loudly that\\nI hung at the door, almost afraid to enter.\\n\\nAs I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance I was\\nsure he must be Long John. His left leg was cut off close by the hip,\\nand under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with\\nwonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall\\nand strong, with a face as big as a ham--plain and pale, but intelligent\\nand smiling. Indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling\\nas he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the\\nshoulder for the more favoured of his guests.\\n\\nNow, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of Long John in\\nSquire Trelawney’s letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might\\nprove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at\\nthe old Benbow. But one look at the man before me was enough. I had seen\\nthe captain, and Black Dog, and the blind man, Pew, and I thought I knew\\nwhat a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to me,\\nfrom this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.\\n\\nI plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up\\nto the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer.\\n\\n“Mr. Silver, sir?” I asked, holding out the note.\\n\\n“Yes, my lad,” said he; “such is my name, to be sure. And who may you\\nbe?” And then as he saw the squire’s letter, he seemed to me to give\\nsomething almost like a start.\\n\\n“Oh!” said he, quite loud, and offering his hand. “I see. You are our\\nnew cabin-boy; pleased I am to see you.”\\n\\nAnd he took my hand in his large firm grasp.\\n\\nJust then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made\\nfor the door. It was close by him, and he was out in the street in a\\nmoment. But his hurry had attracted my notice, and I recognized him at\\nglance. It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had come\\nfirst to the Admiral Benbow.\\n\\n“Oh,” I cried, “stop him! It’s Black Dog!”\\n\\n“I don’t care two coppers who he is,” cried Silver. “But he hasn’t paid\\nhis score. Harry, run and catch him.”\\n\\nOne of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in\\npursuit.\\n\\n“If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score,” cried Silver; and\\nthen, relinquishing my hand, “Who did you say he was?” he asked. “Black\\nwhat?”\\n\\n“Dog, sir,” said I. “Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers?\\nHe was one of them.”\\n\\n“So?” cried Silver. “In my house! Ben, run and help Harry. One of those\\nswabs, was he? Was that you drinking with him, Morgan? Step up here.”\\n\\nThe man whom he called Morgan--an old, grey-haired, mahogany-faced\\nsailor--came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his quid.\\n\\n“Now, Morgan,” said Long John very sternly, “you never clapped your eyes\\non that Black--Black Dog before, did you, now?”\\n\\n“Not I, sir,” said Morgan with a salute.\\n\\n“You didn’t know his name, did you?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“By the powers, Tom Morgan, it’s as good for you!” exclaimed the\\nlandlord. “If you had been mixed up with the like of that, you would\\nnever have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that. And what\\nwas he saying to you?”\\n\\n“I don’t rightly know, sir,” answered Morgan.\\n\\n“Do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed dead-eye?”\\n cried Long John. “Don’t rightly know, don’t you! Perhaps you don’t\\nhappen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps? Come, now, what\\nwas he jawing--v’yages, cap’ns, ships? Pipe up! What was it?”\\n\\n“We was a-talkin’ of keel-hauling,” answered Morgan.\\n\\n“Keel-hauling, was you? And a mighty suitable thing, too, and you may\\nlay to that. Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom.”\\n\\nAnd then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me in a\\nconfidential whisper that was very flattering, as I thought, “He’s\\nquite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on’y stupid. And now,” he ran on again,\\naloud, “let’s see--Black Dog? No, I don’t know the name, not I. Yet I\\nkind of think I’ve--yes, I’ve seen the swab. He used to come here with a\\nblind beggar, he used.”\\n\\n“That he did, you may be sure,” said I. “I knew that blind man too. His\\nname was Pew.”\\n\\n“It was!” cried Silver, now quite excited. “Pew! That were his name for\\ncertain. Ah, he looked a shark, he did! If we run down this Black Dog,\\nnow, there’ll be news for Cap’n Trelawney! Ben’s a good runner; few\\nseamen run better than Ben. He should run him down, hand over hand, by\\nthe powers! He talked o’ keel-hauling, did he? I’LL keel-haul him!”\\n\\nAll the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and\\ndown the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand, and giving\\nsuch a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge\\nor a Bow Street runner. My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on\\nfinding Black Dog at the Spy-glass, and I watched the cook narrowly. But\\nhe was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time\\nthe two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost\\nthe track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, I would have gone\\nbail for the innocence of Long John Silver.\\n\\n“See here, now, Hawkins,” said he, “here’s a blessed hard thing on a\\nman like me, now, ain’t it? There’s Cap’n Trelawney--what’s he to think?\\nHere I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house\\ndrinking of my own rum! Here you comes and tells me of it plain; and\\nhere I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights! Now,\\nHawkins, you do me justice with the cap’n. You’re a lad, you are, but\\nyou’re as smart as paint. I see that when you first come in. Now, here\\nit is: What could I do, with this old timber I hobble on? When I was an\\nA B master mariner I’d have come up alongside of him, hand over hand,\\nand broached him to in a brace of old shakes, I would; but now--”\\n\\nAnd then, all of a sudden, he stopped, and his jaw dropped as though he\\nhad remembered something.\\n\\n“The score!” he burst out. “Three goes o’ rum! Why, shiver my timbers,\\nif I hadn’t forgotten my score!”\\n\\nAnd falling on a bench, he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks.\\nI could not help joining, and we laughed together, peal after peal,\\nuntil the tavern rang again.\\n\\n“Why, what a precious old sea-calf I am!” he said at last, wiping his\\ncheeks. “You and me should get on well, Hawkins, for I’ll take my davy\\nI should be rated ship’s boy. But come now, stand by to go about. This\\nwon’t do. Dooty is dooty, messmates. I’ll put on my old cockerel hat,\\nand step along of you to Cap’n Trelawney, and report this here affair.\\nFor mind you, it’s serious, young Hawkins; and neither you nor me’s come\\nout of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit. Nor you\\nneither, says you; not smart--none of the pair of us smart. But dash my\\nbuttons! That was a good un about my score.”\\n\\nAnd he began to laugh again, and that so heartily, that though I did not\\nsee the joke as he did, I was again obliged to join him in his mirth.\\n\\nOn our little walk along the quays, he made himself the most interesting\\ncompanion, telling me about the different ships that we passed by,\\ntheir rig, tonnage, and nationality, explaining the work that was going\\nforward--how one was discharging, another taking in cargo, and a third\\nmaking ready for sea--and every now and then telling me some little\\nanecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had\\nlearned it perfectly. I began to see that here was one of the best of\\npossible shipmates.\\n\\nWhen we got to the inn, the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together,\\nfinishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they should go\\naboard the schooner on a visit of inspection.\\n\\nLong John told the story from first to last, with a great deal of spirit\\nand the most perfect truth. “That was how it were, now, weren’t it,\\nHawkins?” he would say, now and again, and I could always bear him\\nentirely out.\\n\\nThe two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away, but we all\\nagreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented,\\nLong John took up his crutch and departed.\\n\\n“All hands aboard by four this afternoon,” shouted the squire after him.\\n\\n“Aye, aye, sir,” cried the cook, in the passage.\\n\\n“Well, squire,” said Dr. Livesey, “I don’t put much faith in your\\ndiscoveries, as a general thing; but I will say this, John Silver suits\\nme.”\\n\\n“The man’s a perfect trump,” declared the squire.\\n\\n“And now,” added the doctor, “Jim may come on board with us, may he\\nnot?”\\n\\n“To be sure he may,” says squire. “Take your hat, Hawkins, and we’ll see\\nthe ship.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nPowder and Arms\\n\\nTHE HISPANIOLA lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and\\nround the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated\\nunderneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however,\\nwe got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the\\nmate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a\\nsquint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon\\nobserved that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the\\ncaptain.\\n\\nThis last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on\\nboard and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the\\ncabin when a sailor followed us.\\n\\n“Captain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,” said he.\\n\\n“I am always at the captain’s orders. Show him in,” said the squire.\\n\\nThe captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and\\nshut the door behind him.\\n\\n“Well, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope; all\\nshipshape and seaworthy?”\\n\\n“Well, sir,” said the captain, “better speak plain, I believe, even at\\nthe risk of offence. I don’t like this cruise; I don’t like the men; and\\nI don’t like my officer. That’s short and sweet.”\\n\\n“Perhaps, sir, you don’t like the ship?” inquired the squire, very\\nangry, as I could see.\\n\\n“I can’t speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,” said the\\ncaptain. “She seems a clever craft; more I can’t say.”\\n\\n“Possibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?” says the\\nsquire.\\n\\nBut here Dr. Livesey cut in.\\n\\n“Stay a bit,” said he, “stay a bit. No use of such questions as that but\\nto produce ill feeling. The captain has said too much or he has said too\\nlittle, and I’m bound to say that I require an explanation of his words.\\nYou don’t, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?”\\n\\n“I was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship\\nfor that gentleman where he should bid me,” said the captain. “So far\\nso good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I\\ndo. I don’t call that fair, now, do you?”\\n\\n“No,” said Dr. Livesey, “I don’t.”\\n\\n“Next,” said the captain, “I learn we are going after treasure--hear\\nit from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don’t\\nlike treasure voyages on any account, and I don’t like them, above all,\\nwhen they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the\\nsecret has been told to the parrot.”\\n\\n“Silver’s parrot?” asked the squire.\\n\\n“It’s a way of speaking,” said the captain. “Blabbed, I mean. It’s my\\nbelief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I’ll tell\\nyou my way of it--life or death, and a close run.”\\n\\n“That is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,” replied Dr. Livesey.\\n“We take the risk, but we are not so ignorant as you believe us. Next,\\nyou say you don’t like the crew. Are they not good seamen?”\\n\\n“I don’t like them, sir,” returned Captain Smollett. “And I think I\\nshould have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to that.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you should,” replied the doctor. “My friend should, perhaps,\\nhave taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be one, was\\nunintentional. And you don’t like Mr. Arrow?”\\n\\n“I don’t, sir. I believe he’s a good seaman, but he’s too free with\\nthe crew to be a good officer. A mate should keep himself to\\nhimself--shouldn’t drink with the men before the mast!”\\n\\n“Do you mean he drinks?” cried the squire.\\n\\n“No, sir,” replied the captain, “only that he’s too familiar.”\\n\\n“Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?” asked the doctor.\\n“Tell us what you want.”\\n\\n“Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?”\\n\\n“Like iron,” answered the squire.\\n\\n“Very good,” said the captain. “Then, as you’ve heard me very patiently,\\nsaying things that I could not prove, hear me a few words more. They are\\nputting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have a good\\nplace under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. Then, you\\nare bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of\\nthem are to be berthed forward. Why not give them the berths here beside\\nthe cabin?--second point.”\\n\\n“Any more?” asked Mr. Trelawney.\\n\\n“One more,” said the captain. “There’s been too much blabbing already.”\\n\\n“Far too much,” agreed the doctor.\\n\\n“I’ll tell you what I’ve heard myself,” continued Captain Smollett:\\n“that you have a map of an island, that there’s crosses on the map to\\nshow where treasure is, and that the island lies--” And then he named\\nthe latitude and longitude exactly.\\n\\n“I never told that,” cried the squire, “to a soul!”\\n\\n“The hands know it, sir,” returned the captain.\\n\\n“Livesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,” cried the squire.\\n\\n“It doesn’t much matter who it was,” replied the doctor. And I could\\nsee that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney’s\\nprotestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet\\nin this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the\\nsituation of the island.\\n\\n“Well, gentlemen,” continued the captain, “I don’t know who has this\\nmap; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr.\\nArrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign.”\\n\\n“I see,” said the doctor. “You wish us to keep this matter dark and to\\nmake a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend’s\\nown people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other\\nwords, you fear a mutiny.”\\n\\n“Sir,” said Captain Smollett, “with no intention to take offence, I\\ndeny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be\\njustified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that. As\\nfor Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the\\nsame; all may be for what I know. But I am responsible for the ship’s\\nsafety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her. I see things going,\\nas I think, not quite right. And I ask you to take certain precautions\\nor let me resign my berth. And that’s all.”\\n\\n“Captain Smollett,” began the doctor with a smile, “did ever you hear\\nthe fable of the mountain and the mouse? You’ll excuse me, I dare say,\\nbut you remind me of that fable. When you came in here, I’ll stake my\\nwig, you meant more than this.”\\n\\n“Doctor,” said the captain, “you are smart. When I came in here I meant\\nto get discharged. I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a\\nword.”\\n\\n“No more I would,” cried the squire. “Had Livesey not been here I should\\nhave seen you to the deuce. As it is, I have heard you. I will do as you\\ndesire, but I think the worse of you.”\\n\\n“That’s as you please, sir,” said the captain. “You’ll find I do my\\nduty.”\\n\\nAnd with that he took his leave.\\n\\n“Trelawney,” said the doctor, “contrary to all my notions, I believed\\nyou have managed to get two honest men on board with you--that man and\\nJohn Silver.”\\n\\n“Silver, if you like,” cried the squire; “but as for that intolerable\\nhumbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly, unsailorly, and downright\\nun-English.”\\n\\n“Well,” says the doctor, “we shall see.”\\n\\nWhen we came on deck, the men had begun already to take out the arms and\\npowder, yo-ho-ing at their work, while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood\\nby superintending.\\n\\nThe new arrangement was quite to my liking. The whole schooner had been\\noverhauled; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the\\nafter-part of the main hold; and this set of cabins was only joined to\\nthe galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side. It had\\nbeen originally meant that the captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the\\ndoctor, and the squire were to occupy these six berths. Now Redruth and\\nI were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep\\non deck in the companion, which had been enlarged on each side till you\\nmight almost have called it a round-house. Very low it was still, of\\ncourse; but there was room to swing two hammocks, and even the mate\\nseemed pleased with the arrangement. Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful\\nas to the crew, but that is only guess, for as you shall hear, we had\\nnot long the benefit of his opinion.\\n\\nWe were all hard at work, changing the powder and the berths, when\\nthe last man or two, and Long John along with them, came off in a\\nshore-boat.\\n\\nThe cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness, and as soon as\\nhe saw what was doing, “So ho, mates!” says he. “What’s this?”\\n\\n“We’re a-changing of the powder, Jack,” answers one.\\n\\n“Why, by the powers,” cried Long John, “if we do, we’ll miss the morning\\ntide!”\\n\\n“My orders!” said the captain shortly. “You may go below, my man. Hands\\nwill want supper.”\\n\\n“Aye, aye, sir,” answered the cook, and touching his forelock, he\\ndisappeared at once in the direction of his galley.\\n\\n“That’s a good man, captain,” said the doctor.\\n\\n“Very likely, sir,” replied Captain Smollett. “Easy with that,\\nmen--easy,” he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and\\nthen suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships,\\na long brass nine, “Here you, ship’s boy,” he cried, “out o’ that! Off\\nwith you to the cook and get some work.”\\n\\nAnd then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to the\\ndoctor, “I’ll have no favourites on my ship.”\\n\\nI assure you I was quite of the squire’s way of thinking, and hated the\\ncaptain deeply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nThe Voyage\\n\\nALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their\\nplace, and boatfuls of the squire’s friends, Mr. Blandly and the like,\\ncoming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return. We never had\\na night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work; and I was\\ndog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe\\nand the crew began to man the capstan-bars. I might have been twice\\nas weary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and\\ninteresting to me--the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle,\\nthe men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship’s lanterns.\\n\\n“Now, Barbecue, tip us a stave,” cried one voice.\\n\\n“The old one,” cried another.\\n\\n“Aye, aye, mates,” said Long John, who was standing by, with his crutch\\nunder his arm, and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so\\nwell:\\n\\n“Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest--”\\n\\nAnd then the whole crew bore chorus:--\\n\\n“Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”\\n\\nAnd at the third “Ho!” drove the bars before them with a will.\\n\\nEven at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral\\nBenbow in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping\\nin the chorus. But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging\\ndripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and\\nshipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to\\nsnatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the\\nIsle of Treasure.\\n\\nI am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly\\nprosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable\\nseamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. But before\\nwe came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened\\nwhich require to be known.\\n\\nMr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had\\nfeared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they\\npleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a\\nday or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks,\\nstuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. Time after time\\nhe was ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes he fell and cut himself;\\nsometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the\\ncompanion; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and\\nattend to his work at least passably.\\n\\nIn the meantime, we could never make out where he got the drink. That\\nwas the ship’s mystery. Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to\\nsolve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh if\\nhe were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted\\nanything but water.\\n\\nHe was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst\\nthe men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself\\noutright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark\\nnight, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more.\\n\\n“Overboard!” said the captain. “Well, gentlemen, that saves the trouble\\nof putting him in irons.”\\n\\nBut there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to\\nadvance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest\\nman aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as\\nmate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him\\nvery useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the\\ncoxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who\\ncould be trusted at a pinch with almost anything.\\n\\nHe was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of\\nhis name leads me on to speak of our ship’s cook, Barbecue, as the men\\ncalled him.\\n\\nAboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have\\nboth hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the\\nfoot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding\\nto every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe\\nashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather\\ncross the deck. He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the\\nwidest spaces--Long John’s earrings, they were called; and he would hand\\nhimself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it\\nalongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. Yet some\\nof the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see\\nhim so reduced.\\n\\n“He’s no common man, Barbecue,” said the coxswain to me. “He had good\\nschooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded;\\nand brave--a lion’s nothing alongside of Long John! I seen him grapple\\nfour and knock their heads together--him unarmed.”\\n\\nAll the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of talking\\nto each and doing everybody some particular service. To me he was\\nunweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept\\nas clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in\\na cage in one corner.\\n\\n“Come away, Hawkins,” he would say; “come and have a yarn with John.\\nNobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and hear the\\nnews. Here’s Cap’n Flint--I calls my parrot Cap’n Flint, after the\\nfamous buccaneer--here’s Cap’n Flint predicting success to our v’yage.\\nWasn’t you, cap’n?”\\n\\nAnd the parrot would say, with great rapidity, “Pieces of eight! Pieces\\nof eight! Pieces of eight!” till you wondered that it was not out of\\nbreath, or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage.\\n\\n“Now, that bird,” he would say, “is, maybe, two hundred years\\nold, Hawkins--they live forever mostly; and if anybody’s seen more\\nwickedness, it must be the devil himself. She’s sailed with England,\\nthe great Cap’n England, the pirate. She’s been at Madagascar, and at\\nMalabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello. She was at the\\nfishing up of the wrecked plate ships. It’s there she learned ‘Pieces\\nof eight,’ and little wonder; three hundred and fifty thousand of ’em,\\nHawkins! She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of\\nGoa, she was; and to look at her you would think she was a babby. But\\nyou smelt powder--didn’t you, cap’n?”\\n\\n“Stand by to go about,” the parrot would scream.\\n\\n“Ah, she’s a handsome craft, she is,” the cook would say, and give her\\nsugar from his pocket, and then the bird would peck at the bars and\\nswear straight on, passing belief for wickedness. “There,” John would\\nadd, “you can’t touch pitch and not be mucked, lad. Here’s this poor old\\ninnocent bird o’ mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may\\nlay to that. She would swear the same, in a manner of speaking, before\\nchaplain.” And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had\\nthat made me think he was the best of men.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty\\ndistant terms with one another. The squire made no bones about the\\nmatter; he despised the captain. The captain, on his part, never spoke\\nbut when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a\\nword wasted. He owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have\\nbeen wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted\\nto see and all had behaved fairly well. As for the ship, he had taken a\\ndownright fancy to her. “She’ll lie a point nearer the wind than a man\\nhas a right to expect of his own married wife, sir. But,” he would add,\\n“all I say is, we’re not home again, and I don’t like the cruise.”\\n\\nThe squire, at this, would turn away and march up and down the deck,\\nchin in air.\\n\\n“A trifle more of that man,” he would say, “and I shall explode.”\\n\\nWe had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of the\\nHISPANIOLA. Every man on board seemed well content, and they must have\\nbeen hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is my belief\\nthere was never a ship’s company so spoiled since Noah put to sea.\\nDouble grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff on odd days,\\nas, for instance, if the squire heard it was any man’s birthday, and\\nalways a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to\\nhelp himself that had a fancy.\\n\\n“Never knew good come of it yet,” the captain said to Dr. Livesey.\\n“Spoil forecastle hands, make devils. That’s my belief.”\\n\\nBut good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it had\\nnot been for that, we should have had no note of warning and might all\\nhave perished by the hand of treachery.\\n\\nThis was how it came about.\\n\\nWe had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after--I\\nam not allowed to be more plain--and now we were running down for it\\nwith a bright lookout day and night. It was about the last day of our\\noutward voyage by the largest computation; some time that night, or at\\nlatest before noon of the morrow, we should sight the Treasure Island.\\nWe were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea.\\nThe HISPANIOLA rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now and then with\\na whiff of spray. All was drawing alow and aloft; everyone was in the\\nbravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of\\nour adventure.\\n\\nNow, just after sundown, when all my work was over and I was on my way\\nto my berth, it occurred to me that I should like an apple. I ran on\\ndeck. The watch was all forward looking out for the island. The man at\\nthe helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently\\nto himself, and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea\\nagainst the bows and around the sides of the ship.\\n\\nIn I got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was scarce an\\napple left; but sitting down there in the dark, what with the sound of\\nthe waters and the rocking movement of the ship, I had either fallen\\nasleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with\\nrather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders\\nagainst it, and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak.\\nIt was Silver’s voice, and before I had heard a dozen words, I would\\nnot have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and\\nlistening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen\\nwords I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended\\nupon me alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\nWhat I Heard in the Apple Barrel\\n\\n“NO, not I,” said Silver. “Flint was cap’n; I was quartermaster, along\\nof my timber leg. The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his\\ndeadlights. It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me--out of\\ncollege and all--Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged\\nlike a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle. That\\nwas Roberts’ men, that was, and comed of changing names to their\\nships--ROYAL FORTUNE and so on. Now, what a ship was christened, so let\\nher stay, I says. So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe\\nhome from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it\\nwas with the old WALRUS, Flint’s old ship, as I’ve seen amuck with the\\nred blood and fit to sink with gold.”\\n\\n“Ah!” cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and\\nevidently full of admiration. “He was the flower of the flock, was\\nFlint!”\\n\\n“Davis was a man too, by all accounts,” said Silver. “I never sailed\\nalong of him; first with England, then with Flint, that’s my story;\\nand now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine\\nhundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint. That ain’t bad\\nfor a man before the mast--all safe in bank. ’Tain’t earning now, it’s\\nsaving does it, you may lay to that. Where’s all England’s men now? I\\ndunno. Where’s Flint’s? Why, most on ’em aboard here, and glad to get\\nthe duff--been begging before that, some on ’em. Old Pew, as had lost\\nhis sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in\\na year, like a lord in Parliament. Where is he now? Well, he’s dead now\\nand under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers,\\nthe man was starving! He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and\\nstarved at that, by the powers!”\\n\\n“Well, it ain’t much use, after all,” said the young seaman.\\n\\n“’Tain’t much use for fools, you may lay to it--that, nor nothing,”\\n cried Silver. “But now, you look here: you’re young, you are, but you’re\\nas smart as paint. I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I’ll talk\\nto you like a man.”\\n\\nYou may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue\\naddressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used\\nto myself. I think, if I had been able, that I would have killed\\nhim through the barrel. Meantime, he ran on, little supposing he was\\noverheard.\\n\\n“Here it is about gentlemen of fortune. They lives rough, and they risk\\nswinging, but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks, and when a cruise\\nis done, why, it’s hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings\\nin their pockets. Now, the most goes for rum and a good fling, and to\\nsea again in their shirts. But that’s not the course I lay. I puts it\\nall away, some here, some there, and none too much anywheres, by reason\\nof suspicion. I’m fifty, mark you; once back from this cruise, I set up\\ngentleman in earnest. Time enough too, says you. Ah, but I’ve lived easy\\nin the meantime, never denied myself o’ nothing heart desires, and slep’\\nsoft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea. And how did I begin?\\nBefore the mast, like you!”\\n\\n“Well,” said the other, “but all the other money’s gone now, ain’t it?\\nYou daren’t show face in Bristol after this.”\\n\\n“Why, where might you suppose it was?” asked Silver derisively.\\n\\n“At Bristol, in banks and places,” answered his companion.\\n\\n“It were,” said the cook; “it were when we weighed anchor. But my old\\nmissis has it all by now. And the Spy-glass is sold, lease and goodwill\\nand rigging; and the old girl’s off to meet me. I would tell you where,\\nfor I trust you, but it’d make jealousy among the mates.”\\n\\n“And can you trust your missis?” asked the other.\\n\\n“Gentlemen of fortune,” returned the cook, “usually trusts little among\\nthemselves, and right they are, you may lay to it. But I have a way with\\nme, I have. When a mate brings a slip on his cable--one as knows me, I\\nmean--it won’t be in the same world with old John. There was some that\\nwas feared of Pew, and some that was feared of Flint; but Flint his own\\nself was feared of me. Feared he was, and proud. They was the roughest\\ncrew afloat, was Flint’s; the devil himself would have been feared to go\\nto sea with them. Well now, I tell you, I’m not a boasting man, and you\\nseen yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster,\\nLAMBS wasn’t the word for Flint’s old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of\\nyourself in old John’s ship.”\\n\\n“Well, I tell you now,” replied the lad, “I didn’t half a quarter like\\nthe job till I had this talk with you, John; but there’s my hand on it\\nnow.”\\n\\n“And a brave lad you were, and smart too,” answered Silver, shaking\\nhands so heartily that all the barrel shook, “and a finer figurehead for\\na gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.”\\n\\nBy this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. By a\\n“gentleman of fortune” they plainly meant neither more nor less than a\\ncommon pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last\\nact in the corruption of one of the honest hands--perhaps of the last\\none left aboard. But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver\\ngiving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the\\nparty.\\n\\n“Dick’s square,” said Silver.\\n\\n“Oh, I know’d Dick was square,” returned the voice of the coxswain,\\nIsrael Hands. “He’s no fool, is Dick.” And he turned his quid and spat.\\n“But look here,” he went on, “here’s what I want to know, Barbecue: how\\nlong are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat? I’ve had\\na’most enough o’ Cap’n Smollett; he’s hazed me long enough, by thunder!\\nI want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and\\nthat.”\\n\\n“Israel,” said Silver, “your head ain’t much account, nor ever was. But\\nyou’re able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough.\\nNow, here’s what I say: you’ll berth forward, and you’ll live hard, and\\nyou’ll speak soft, and you’ll keep sober till I give the word; and you\\nmay lay to that, my son.”\\n\\n“Well, I don’t say no, do I?” growled the coxswain. “What I say is,\\nwhen? That’s what I say.”\\n\\n“When! By the powers!” cried Silver. “Well now, if you want to know,\\nI’ll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that’s when.\\nHere’s a first-rate seaman, Cap’n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for\\nus. Here’s this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don’t know\\nwhere it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this\\nsquire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard,\\nby the powers. Then we’ll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double\\nDutchmen, I’d have Cap’n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before\\nI struck.”\\n\\n“Why, we’re all seamen aboard here, I should think,” said the lad Dick.\\n\\n“We’re all forecastle hands, you mean,” snapped Silver. “We can steer\\na course, but who’s to set one? That’s what all you gentlemen split on,\\nfirst and last. If I had my way, I’d have Cap’n Smollett work us back\\ninto the trades at least; then we’d have no blessed miscalculations and\\na spoonful of water a day. But I know the sort you are. I’ll finish with\\n’em at the island, as soon’s the blunt’s on board, and a pity it is. But\\nyou’re never happy till you’re drunk. Split my sides, I’ve a sick heart\\nto sail with the likes of you!”\\n\\n“Easy all, Long John,” cried Israel. “Who’s a-crossin’ of you?”\\n\\n“Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard? And\\nhow many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock?” cried Silver.\\n“And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry. You hear me? I seen\\na thing or two at sea, I have. If you would on’y lay your course, and a\\np’int to windward, you would ride in carriages, you would. But not you!\\nI know you. You’ll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow, and go hang.”\\n\\n“Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling, John; but there’s others\\nas could hand and steer as well as you,” said Israel. “They liked a bit\\no’ fun, they did. They wasn’t so high and dry, nohow, but took their\\nfling, like jolly companions every one.”\\n\\n“So?” says Silver. “Well, and where are they now? Pew was that sort,\\nand he died a beggar-man. Flint was, and he died of rum at Savannah. Ah,\\nthey was a sweet crew, they was! On’y, where are they?”\\n\\n“But,” asked Dick, “when we do lay ’em athwart, what are we to do with\\n’em, anyhow?”\\n\\n“There’s the man for me!” cried the cook admiringly. “That’s what I call\\nbusiness. Well, what would you think? Put ’em ashore like maroons? That\\nwould have been England’s way. Or cut ’em down like that much pork? That\\nwould have been Flint’s, or Billy Bones’s.”\\n\\n“Billy was the man for that,” said Israel. “‘Dead men don’t bite,’ says\\nhe. Well, he’s dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now;\\nand if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.”\\n\\n“Right you are,” said Silver; “rough and ready. But mark you here,\\nI’m an easy man--I’m quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it’s\\nserious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote--death. When I’m in\\nParlyment and riding in my coach, I don’t want none of these sea-lawyers\\nin the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers.\\nWait is what I say; but when the time comes, why, let her rip!”\\n\\n“John,” cries the coxswain, “you’re a man!”\\n\\n“You’ll say so, Israel when you see,” said Silver. “Only one thing I\\nclaim--I claim Trelawney. I’ll wring his calf’s head off his body with\\nthese hands, Dick!” he added, breaking off. “You just jump up, like a\\nsweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.”\\n\\nYou may fancy the terror I was in! I should have leaped out and run for\\nit if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me.\\nI heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and\\nthe voice of Hands exclaimed, “Oh, stow that! Don’t you get sucking of\\nthat bilge, John. Let’s have a go of the rum.”\\n\\n“Dick,” said Silver, “I trust you. I’ve a gauge on the keg, mind.\\nThere’s the key; you fill a pannikin and bring it up.”\\n\\nTerrified as I was, I could not help thinking to myself that this must\\nhave been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him.\\n\\nDick was gone but a little while, and during his absence Israel spoke\\nstraight on in the cook’s ear. It was but a word or two that I could\\ncatch, and yet I gathered some important news, for besides other scraps\\nthat tended to the same purpose, this whole clause was audible: “Not\\nanother man of them’ll jine.” Hence there were still faithful men on\\nboard.\\n\\nWhen Dick returned, one after another of the trio took the pannikin and\\ndrank--one “To luck,” another with a “Here’s to old Flint,” and Silver\\nhimself saying, in a kind of song, “Here’s to ourselves, and hold your\\nluff, plenty of prizes and plenty of duff.”\\n\\nJust then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel, and looking\\nup, I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and\\nshining white on the luff of the fore-sail; and almost at the same time\\nthe voice of the lookout shouted, “Land ho!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nCouncil of War\\n\\nTHERE was a great rush of feet across the deck. I could hear people\\ntumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an\\ninstant outside my barrel, I dived behind the fore-sail, made a double\\ntowards the stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join\\nHunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow.\\n\\nThere all hands were already congregated. A belt of fog had lifted\\nalmost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. Away to the\\nsouth-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart,\\nand rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was\\nstill buried in the fog. All three seemed sharp and conical in figure.\\n\\nSo much I saw, almost in a dream, for I had not yet recovered from my\\nhorrid fear of a minute or two before. And then I heard the voice of\\nCaptain Smollett issuing orders. The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of\\npoints nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the\\nisland on the east.\\n\\n“And now, men,” said the captain, when all was sheeted home, “has any\\none of you ever seen that land ahead?”\\n\\n“I have, sir,” said Silver. “I’ve watered there with a trader I was cook\\nin.”\\n\\n“The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?” asked the\\ncaptain.\\n\\n“Yes, sir; Skeleton Island they calls it. It were a main place for\\npirates once, and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it.\\nThat hill to the nor’ard they calls the Fore-mast Hill; there are three\\nhills in a row running south’ard--fore, main, and mizzen, sir. But the\\nmain--that’s the big un, with the cloud on it--they usually calls\\nthe Spy-glass, by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the\\nanchorage cleaning, for it’s there they cleaned their ships, sir, asking\\nyour pardon.”\\n\\n“I have a chart here,” says Captain Smollett. “See if that’s the place.”\\n\\nLong John’s eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the\\nfresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment. This\\nwas not the map we found in Billy Bones’s chest, but an accurate copy,\\ncomplete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single\\nexception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have\\nbeen his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said he, “this is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily\\ndrawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The pirates were too\\nignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: ‘Capt. Kidd’s Anchorage’--just\\nthe name my shipmate called it. There’s a strong current runs along the\\nsouth, and then away nor’ard up the west coast. Right you was, sir,”\\n says he, “to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island.\\nLeastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there\\nain’t no better place for that in these waters.”\\n\\n“Thank you, my man,” says Captain Smollett. “I’ll ask you later on to\\ngive us a help. You may go.”\\n\\nI was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge\\nof the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing\\nnearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I had overheard his\\ncouncil from the apple barrel, and yet I had by this time taken such a\\nhorror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that I could scarce conceal\\na shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm.\\n\\n“Ah,” says he, “this here is a sweet spot, this island--a sweet spot for\\na lad to get ashore on. You’ll bathe, and you’ll climb trees, and you’ll\\nhunt goats, you will; and you’ll get aloft on them hills like a goat\\nyourself. Why, it makes me young again. I was going to forget my timber\\nleg, I was. It’s a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes, and you\\nmay lay to that. When you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask\\nold John, and he’ll put up a snack for you to take along.”\\n\\nAnd clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off\\nforward and went below.\\n\\nCaptain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on\\nthe quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst\\nnot interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my\\nthoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his\\nside. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had\\nmeant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak\\nand not to be overheard, I broke immediately, “Doctor, let me speak. Get\\nthe captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to\\nsend for me. I have terrible news.”\\n\\nThe doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master\\nof himself.\\n\\n“Thank you, Jim,” said he quite loudly, “that was all I wanted to know,”\\n as if he had asked me a question.\\n\\nAnd with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. They\\nspoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised\\nhis voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey\\nhad communicated my request, for the next thing that I heard was the\\ncaptain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on\\ndeck.\\n\\n“My lads,” said Captain Smollett, “I’ve a word to say to you. This\\nland that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for. Mr.\\nTrelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all know, has just\\nasked me a word or two, and as I was able to tell him that every man on\\nboard had done his duty, alow and aloft, as I never ask to see it done\\nbetter, why, he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to\\ndrink YOUR health and luck, and you’ll have grog served out for you to\\ndrink OUR health and luck. I’ll tell you what I think of this: I think\\nit handsome. And if you think as I do, you’ll give a good sea-cheer for\\nthe gentleman that does it.”\\n\\nThe cheer followed--that was a matter of course; but it rang out so full\\nand hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were\\nplotting for our blood.\\n\\n“One more cheer for Cap’n Smollett,” cried Long John when the first had\\nsubsided.\\n\\nAnd this also was given with a will.\\n\\nOn the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long after,\\nword was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin.\\n\\nI found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of Spanish wine\\nand some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking away, with his wig\\non his lap, and that, I knew, was a sign that he was agitated. The stern\\nwindow was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon\\nshining behind on the ship’s wake.\\n\\n“Now, Hawkins,” said the squire, “you have something to say. Speak up.”\\n\\nI did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the whole\\ndetails of Silver’s conversation. Nobody interrupted me till I was done,\\nnor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement, but\\nthey kept their eyes upon my face from first to last.\\n\\n“Jim,” said Dr. Livesey, “take a seat.”\\n\\nAnd they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a glass of\\nwine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one after the other,\\nand each with a bow, drank my good health, and their service to me, for\\nmy luck and courage.\\n\\n“Now, captain,” said the squire, “you were right, and I was wrong. I own\\nmyself an ass, and I await your orders.”\\n\\n“No more an ass than I, sir,” returned the captain. “I never heard of a\\ncrew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before, for any man that\\nhad an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according. But\\nthis crew,” he added, “beats me.”\\n\\n“Captain,” said the doctor, “with your permission, that’s Silver. A very\\nremarkable man.”\\n\\n“He’d look remarkably well from a yard-arm, sir,” returned the captain.\\n“But this is talk; this don’t lead to anything. I see three or four\\npoints, and with Mr. Trelawney’s permission, I’ll name them.”\\n\\n“You, sir, are the captain. It is for you to speak,” says Mr. Trelawney\\ngrandly.\\n\\n“First point,” began Mr. Smollett. “We must go on, because we can’t turn\\nback. If I gave the word to go about, they would rise at once. Second\\npoint, we have time before us--at least until this treasure’s found.\\nThird point, there are faithful hands. Now, sir, it’s got to come\\nto blows sooner or later, and what I propose is to take time by the\\nforelock, as the saying is, and come to blows some fine day when they\\nleast expect it. We can count, I take it, on your own home servants, Mr.\\nTrelawney?”\\n\\n“As upon myself,” declared the squire.\\n\\n“Three,” reckoned the captain; “ourselves make seven, counting Hawkins\\nhere. Now, about the honest hands?”\\n\\n“Most likely Trelawney’s own men,” said the doctor; “those he had picked\\nup for himself before he lit on Silver.”\\n\\n“Nay,” replied the squire. “Hands was one of mine.”\\n\\n“I did think I could have trusted Hands,” added the captain.\\n\\n“And to think that they’re all Englishmen!” broke out the squire. “Sir,\\nI could find it in my heart to blow the ship up.”\\n\\n“Well, gentlemen,” said the captain, “the best that I can say is not\\nmuch. We must lay to, if you please, and keep a bright lookout. It’s\\ntrying on a man, I know. It would be pleasanter to come to blows. But\\nthere’s no help for it till we know our men. Lay to, and whistle for a\\nwind, that’s my view.”\\n\\n“Jim here,” said the doctor, “can help us more than anyone. The men are\\nnot shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.”\\n\\n“Hawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,” added the squire.\\n\\nI began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether\\nhelpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed\\nthrough me that safety came. In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there\\nwere only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and\\nout of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were\\nsix to their nineteen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART THREE--My Shore Adventure\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nHow My Shore Adventure Began\\n\\nTHE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was\\naltogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had\\nmade a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed\\nabout half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast.\\nGrey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint\\nwas indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands,\\nand by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others--some\\nsingly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad.\\nThe hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock.\\nAll were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four\\nhundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in\\nconfiguration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly\\ncut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.\\n\\nThe HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms\\nwere tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the\\nwhole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had\\nto cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my\\neyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this\\nstanding still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never\\nlearned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an\\nempty stomach.\\n\\nPerhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its\\ngrey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we\\ncould both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at\\nleast, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were\\nfishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone\\nwould have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart\\nsank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I\\nhated the very thought of Treasure Island.\\n\\nWe had a dreary morning’s work before us, for there was no sign of any\\nwind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped\\nthree or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow\\npassage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of\\nthe boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering,\\nand the men grumbled fiercely over their work. Anderson was in command\\nof my boat, and instead of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as\\nloud as the worst.\\n\\n“Well,” he said with an oath, “it’s not forever.”\\n\\nI thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men had gone\\nbriskly and willingly about their business; but the very sight of the\\nisland had relaxed the cords of discipline.\\n\\nAll the way in, Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship.\\nHe knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the man in the\\nchains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart, John never\\nhesitated once.\\n\\n“There’s a strong scour with the ebb,” he said, “and this here passage\\nhas been dug out, in a manner of speaking, with a spade.”\\n\\nWe brought up just where the anchor was in the chart, about a third of\\na mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on\\nthe other. The bottom was clean sand. The plunge of our anchor sent up\\nclouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods, but in less than a\\nminute they were down again and all was once more silent.\\n\\nThe place was entirely land-locked, buried in woods, the trees coming\\nright down to high-water mark, the shores mostly flat, and the hilltops\\nstanding round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre, one here, one\\nthere. Two little rivers, or rather two swamps, emptied out into this\\npond, as you might call it; and the foliage round that part of the shore\\nhad a kind of poisonous brightness. From the ship we could see nothing\\nof the house or stockade, for they were quite buried among trees; and if\\nit had not been for the chart on the companion, we might have been the\\nfirst that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the\\nseas.\\n\\nThere was not a breath of air moving, nor a sound but that of the\\nsurf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks\\noutside. A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage--a smell of\\nsodden leaves and rotting tree trunks. I observed the doctor sniffing\\nand sniffing, like someone tasting a bad egg.\\n\\n“I don’t know about treasure,” he said, “but I’ll stake my wig there’s\\nfever here.”\\n\\nIf the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat, it became truly\\nthreatening when they had come aboard. They lay about the deck growling\\ntogether in talk. The slightest order was received with a black look and\\ngrudgingly and carelessly obeyed. Even the honest hands must have caught\\nthe infection, for there was not one man aboard to mend another. Mutiny,\\nit was plain, hung over us like a thunder-cloud.\\n\\nAnd it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger. Long\\nJohn was hard at work going from group to group, spending himself in\\ngood advice, and as for example no man could have shown a better. He\\nfairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility; he was all\\nsmiles to everyone. If an order were given, John would be on his crutch\\nin an instant, with the cheeriest “Aye, aye, sir!” in the world; and\\nwhen there was nothing else to do, he kept up one song after another, as\\nif to conceal the discontent of the rest.\\n\\nOf all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon, this obvious\\nanxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst.\\n\\nWe held a council in the cabin.\\n\\n“Sir,” said the captain, “if I risk another order, the whole ship’ll\\ncome about our ears by the run. You see, sir, here it is. I get a rough\\nanswer, do I not? Well, if I speak back, pikes will be going in two\\nshakes; if I don’t, Silver will see there’s something under that, and\\nthe game’s up. Now, we’ve only one man to rely on.”\\n\\n“And who is that?” asked the squire.\\n\\n“Silver, sir,” returned the captain; “he’s as anxious as you and I to\\nsmother things up. This is a tiff; he’d soon talk ’em out of it if he\\nhad the chance, and what I propose to do is to give him the chance.\\nLet’s allow the men an afternoon ashore. If they all go, why we’ll fight\\nthe ship. If they none of them go, well then, we hold the cabin, and God\\ndefend the right. If some go, you mark my words, sir, Silver’ll bring\\n’em aboard again as mild as lambs.”\\n\\nIt was so decided; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men;\\nHunter, Joyce, and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received\\nthe news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for,\\nand then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew.\\n\\n“My lads,” said he, “we’ve had a hot day and are all tired and out of\\nsorts. A turn ashore’ll hurt nobody--the boats are still in the water;\\nyou can take the gigs, and as many as please may go ashore for the\\nafternoon. I’ll fire a gun half an hour before sundown.”\\n\\nI believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their\\nshins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all came out\\nof their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a\\nfaraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the\\nanchorage.\\n\\nThe captain was too bright to be in the way. He whipped out of sight\\nin a moment, leaving Silver to arrange the party, and I fancy it was as\\nwell he did so. Had he been on deck, he could no longer so much as\\nhave pretended not to understand the situation. It was as plain as day.\\nSilver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it. The\\nhonest hands--and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on\\nboard--must have been very stupid fellows. Or rather, I suppose the\\ntruth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the\\nringleaders--only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in\\nthe main, could neither be led nor driven any further. It is one thing\\nto be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a\\nnumber of innocent men.\\n\\nAt last, however, the party was made up. Six fellows were to stay on\\nboard, and the remaining thirteen, including Silver, began to embark.\\n\\nThen it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions\\nthat contributed so much to save our lives. If six men were left by\\nSilver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and\\nsince only six were left, it was equally plain that the cabin party\\nhad no present need of my assistance. It occurred to me at once to go\\nashore. In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the\\nfore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment she\\nshoved off.\\n\\nNo one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, “Is that you, Jim?\\nKeep your head down.” But Silver, from the other boat, looked sharply\\nover and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment I\\nbegan to regret what I had done.\\n\\nThe crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having some start\\nand being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of\\nher consort, and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I\\nhad caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest\\nthicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind.\\n\\n“Jim, Jim!” I heard him shouting.\\n\\nBut you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking\\nthrough, I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nThe First Blow\\n\\nI WAS so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to\\nenjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land\\nthat I was in.\\n\\nI had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd,\\noutlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an\\nopen piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with\\na few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak\\nin growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows. On the far side of\\nthe open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining\\nvividly in the sun.\\n\\nI now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle was\\nuninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front\\nof me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and thither among the\\ntrees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and\\nthere I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and\\nhissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. Little did\\nI suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous\\nrattle.\\n\\nThen I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees--live, or\\nevergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called--which grew\\nlow along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the\\nfoliage compact, like thatch. The thicket stretched down from the top of\\none of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until\\nit reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest\\nof the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage. The marsh was\\nsteaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled\\nthrough the haze.\\n\\nAll at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes;\\na wild duck flew up with a quack, another followed, and soon over the\\nwhole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and\\ncircling in the air. I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be\\ndrawing near along the borders of the fen. Nor was I deceived, for soon\\nI heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as I\\ncontinued to give ear, grew steadily louder and nearer.\\n\\nThis put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest\\nlive-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse.\\n\\nAnother voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized\\nto be Silver’s, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while\\nin a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other. By the sound\\nthey must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no\\ndistinct word came to my hearing.\\n\\nAt last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down,\\nfor not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves\\nbegan to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the\\nswamp.\\n\\nAnd now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that since\\nI had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the\\nleast I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my\\nplain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the\\nfavourable ambush of the crouching trees.\\n\\nI could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by\\nthe sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that\\nstill hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders.\\n\\nCrawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at\\nlast, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear\\ndown into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about\\nwith trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to\\nface in conversation.\\n\\nThe sun beat full upon them. Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the\\nground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was\\nlifted to the other man’s in a kind of appeal.\\n\\n“Mate,” he was saying, “it’s because I thinks gold dust of you--gold\\ndust, and you may lay to that! If I hadn’t took to you like pitch, do\\nyou think I’d have been here a-warning of you? All’s up--you can’t make\\nnor mend; it’s to save your neck that I’m a-speaking, and if one of the\\nwild uns knew it, where’d I be, Tom--now, tell me, where’d I be?”\\n\\n“Silver,” said the other man--and I observed he was not only red in the\\nface, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook too, like a\\ntaut rope--“Silver,” says he, “you’re old, and you’re honest, or has the\\nname for it; and you’ve money too, which lots of poor sailors hasn’t;\\nand you’re brave, or I’m mistook. And will you tell me you’ll let\\nyourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs? Not you! As sure\\nas God sees me, I’d sooner lose my hand. If I turn agin my dooty--”\\n\\nAnd then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise. I had found\\none of the honest hands--well, here, at that same moment, came news of\\nanother. Far away out in the marsh there arose, all of a sudden, a sound\\nlike the cry of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one\\nhorrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a\\nscore of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again, darkening\\nheaven, with a simultaneous whirr; and long after that death yell was\\nstill ringing in my brain, silence had re-established its empire, and\\nonly the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant\\nsurges disturbed the languor of the afternoon.\\n\\nTom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but Silver had\\nnot winked an eye. He stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch,\\nwatching his companion like a snake about to spring.\\n\\n“John!” said the sailor, stretching out his hand.\\n\\n“Hands off!” cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me, with\\nthe speed and security of a trained gymnast.\\n\\n“Hands off, if you like, John Silver,” said the other. “It’s a black\\nconscience that can make you feared of me. But in heaven’s name, tell\\nme, what was that?”\\n\\n“That?” returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye\\na mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of glass.\\n“That? Oh, I reckon that’ll be Alan.”\\n\\nAnd at this point Tom flashed out like a hero.\\n\\n“Alan!” he cried. “Then rest his soul for a true seaman! And as for you,\\nJohn Silver, long you’ve been a mate of mine, but you’re mate of mine\\nno more. If I die like a dog, I’ll die in my dooty. You’ve killed Alan,\\nhave you? Kill me too, if you can. But I defies you.”\\n\\nAnd with that, this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook\\nand set off walking for the beach. But he was not destined to go far.\\nWith a cry John seized the branch of a tree, whipped the crutch out of\\nhis armpit, and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air.\\nIt struck poor Tom, point foremost, and with stunning violence, right\\nbetween the shoulders in the middle of his back. His hands flew up, he\\ngave a sort of gasp, and fell.\\n\\nWhether he were injured much or little, none could ever tell. Like\\nenough, to judge from the sound, his back was broken on the spot. But he\\nhad no time given him to recover. Silver, agile as a monkey even without\\nleg or crutch, was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried\\nhis knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body. From my place of\\nambush, I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows.\\n\\nI do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know that for the\\nnext little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling\\nmist; Silver and the birds, and the tall Spy-glass hilltop, going\\nround and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes, and all manner of bells\\nringing and distant voices shouting in my ear.\\n\\nWhen I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together,\\nhis crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. Just before him Tom\\nlay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit,\\ncleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass.\\nEverything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the\\nsteaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce\\npersuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life\\ncruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes.\\n\\nBut now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and\\nblew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated\\nair. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but\\nit instantly awoke my fears. More men would be coming. I might be\\ndiscovered. They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom\\nand Alan, might not I come next?\\n\\nInstantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again, with what\\nspeed and silence I could manage, to the more open portion of the\\nwood. As I did so, I could hear hails coming and going between the old\\nbuccaneer and his comrades, and this sound of danger lent me wings. As\\nsoon as I was clear of the thicket, I ran as I never ran before, scarce\\nminding the direction of my flight, so long as it led me from the\\nmurderers; and as I ran, fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into\\na kind of frenzy.\\n\\nIndeed, could anyone be more entirely lost than I? When the gun fired,\\nhow should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends, still\\nsmoking from their crime? Would not the first of them who saw me wring\\nmy neck like a snipe’s? Would not my absence itself be an evidence to\\nthem of my alarm, and therefore of my fatal knowledge? It was all over,\\nI thought. Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA; good-bye to the squire, the\\ndoctor, and the captain! There was nothing left for me but death by\\nstarvation or death by the hands of the mutineers.\\n\\nAll this while, as I say, I was still running, and without taking any\\nnotice, I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two\\npeaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew\\nmore widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and\\ndimensions. Mingled with these were a few scattered pines, some fifty,\\nsome nearer seventy, feet high. The air too smelt more freshly than down\\nbeside the marsh.\\n\\nAnd here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nThe Man of the Island\\n\\nFROM the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of\\ngravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees.\\nMy eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap\\nwith great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. What it was, whether\\nbear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It seemed dark and\\nshaggy; more I knew not. But the terror of this new apparition brought\\nme to a stand.\\n\\nI was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers,\\nbefore me this lurking nondescript. And immediately I began to prefer\\nthe dangers that I knew to those I knew not. Silver himself appeared\\nless terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned\\non my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to\\nretrace my steps in the direction of the boats.\\n\\nInstantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to\\nhead me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as when I\\nrose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an\\nadversary. From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running\\nmanlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping\\nalmost double as it ran. Yet a man it was, I could no longer be in doubt\\nabout that.\\n\\nI began to recall what I had heard of cannibals. I was within an ace of\\ncalling for help. But the mere fact that he was a man, however wild,\\nhad somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in\\nproportion. I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of\\nescape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed\\ninto my mind. As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage\\nglowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of\\nthe island and walked briskly towards him.\\n\\nHe was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he must\\nhave been watching me closely, for as soon as I began to move in his\\ndirection he reappeared and took a step to meet me. Then he hesitated,\\ndrew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and\\nconfusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in\\nsupplication.\\n\\nAt that I once more stopped.\\n\\n“Who are you?” I asked.\\n\\n“Ben Gunn,” he answered, and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward,\\nlike a rusty lock. “I’m poor Ben Gunn, I am; and I haven’t spoke with a\\nChristian these three years.”\\n\\nI could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his\\nfeatures were even pleasing. His skin, wherever it was exposed, was\\nburnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked\\nquite startling in so dark a face. Of all the beggar-men that I had seen\\nor fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. He was clothed with tatters\\nof old ship’s canvas and old sea-cloth, and this extraordinary patchwork\\nwas all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous\\nfastenings, brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin.\\nAbout his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which was the\\none thing solid in his whole accoutrement.\\n\\n“Three years!” I cried. “Were you shipwrecked?”\\n\\n“Nay, mate,” said he; “marooned.”\\n\\nI had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of\\npunishment common enough among the buccaneers, in which the offender\\nis put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some\\ndesolate and distant island.\\n\\n“Marooned three years agone,” he continued, “and lived on goats since\\nthen, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a man can\\ndo for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You\\nmightn’t happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well,\\nmany’s the long night I’ve dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke\\nup again, and here I were.”\\n\\n“If ever I can get aboard again,” said I, “you shall have cheese by the\\nstone.”\\n\\nAll this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing\\nmy hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of\\nhis speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow\\ncreature. But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled\\nslyness.\\n\\n“If ever you can get aboard again, says you?” he repeated. “Why, now,\\nwho’s to hinder you?”\\n\\n“Not you, I know,” was my reply.\\n\\n“And right you was,” he cried. “Now you--what do you call yourself,\\nmate?”\\n\\n“Jim,” I told him.\\n\\n“Jim, Jim,” says he, quite pleased apparently. “Well, now, Jim, I’ve\\nlived that rough as you’d be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you\\nwouldn’t think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?” he asked.\\n\\n“Why, no, not in particular,” I answered.\\n\\n“Ah, well,” said he, “but I had--remarkable pious. And I was a civil,\\npious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn’t\\ntell one word from another. And here’s what it come to, Jim, and it\\nbegun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That’s what it\\nbegun with, but it went further’n that; and so my mother told me, and\\npredicked the whole, she did, the pious woman! But it were Providence\\nthat put me here. I’ve thought it all out in this here lonely island,\\nand I’m back on piety. You don’t catch me tasting rum so much, but just\\na thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I’m bound\\nI’ll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim”--looking all round him and\\nlowering his voice to a whisper--“I’m rich.”\\n\\nI now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and\\nI suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the\\nstatement hotly: “Rich! Rich! I says. And I’ll tell you what: I’ll make\\na man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you’ll bless your stars, you will, you was\\nthe first that found me!”\\n\\nAnd at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he\\ntightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly\\nbefore my eyes.\\n\\n“Now, Jim, you tell me true: that ain’t Flint’s ship?” he asked.\\n\\nAt this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found\\nan ally, and I answered him at once.\\n\\n“It’s not Flint’s ship, and Flint is dead; but I’ll tell you true, as\\nyou ask me--there are some of Flint’s hands aboard; worse luck for the\\nrest of us.”\\n\\n“Not a man--with one--leg?” he gasped.\\n\\n“Silver?” I asked.\\n\\n“Ah, Silver!” says he. “That were his name.”\\n\\n“He’s the cook, and the ringleader too.”\\n\\nHe was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a\\nwring.\\n\\n“If you was sent by Long John,” he said, “I’m as good as pork, and I\\nknow it. But where was you, do you suppose?”\\n\\nI had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him\\nthe whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found\\nourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he\\npatted me on the head.\\n\\n“You’re a good lad, Jim,” he said; “and you’re all in a clove hitch,\\nain’t you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn’s the man\\nto do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove\\na liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you\\nremark?”\\n\\nI told him the squire was the most liberal of men.\\n\\n“Aye, but you see,” returned Ben Gunn, “I didn’t mean giving me a gate\\nto keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that’s not my mark,\\nJim. What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say\\none thousand pounds out of money that’s as good as a man’s own already?”\\n\\n“I am sure he would,” said I. “As it was, all hands were to share.”\\n\\n“AND a passage home?” he added with a look of great shrewdness.\\n\\n“Why,” I cried, “the squire’s a gentleman. And besides, if we got rid of\\nthe others, we should want you to help work the vessel home.”\\n\\n“Ah,” said he, “so you would.” And he seemed very much relieved.\\n\\n“Now, I’ll tell you what,” he went on. “So much I’ll tell you, and no\\nmore. I were in Flint’s ship when he buried the treasure; he and\\nsix along--six strong seamen. They was ashore nigh on a week, and us\\nstanding off and on in the old WALRUS. One fine day up went the signal,\\nand here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in\\na blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about\\nthe cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead\\nand buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was\\nbattle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy\\nBones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him\\nwhere the treasure was. ‘Ah,’ says he, ‘you can go ashore, if you like,\\nand stay,’ he says; ‘but as for the ship, she’ll beat up for more, by\\nthunder!’ That’s what he said.\\n\\n“Well, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this\\nisland. ‘Boys,’ said I, ‘here’s Flint’s treasure; let’s land and find\\nit.’ The cap’n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a\\nmind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had\\nthe worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. ‘As\\nfor you, Benjamin Gunn,’ says they, ‘here’s a musket,’ they says, ‘and\\na spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint’s money for\\nyourself,’ they says.\\n\\n“Well, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian\\ndiet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I\\nlook like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren’t, neither, I\\nsays.”\\n\\nAnd with that he winked and pinched me hard.\\n\\n“Just you mention them words to your squire, Jim,” he went on. “Nor he\\nweren’t, neither--that’s the words. Three years he were the man of this\\nisland, light and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he would maybe\\nthink upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would maybe think of\\nhis old mother, so be as she’s alive (you’ll say); but the most part\\nof Gunn’s time (this is what you’ll say)--the most part of his time was\\ntook up with another matter. And then you’ll give him a nip, like I do.”\\n\\nAnd he pinched me again in the most confidential manner.\\n\\n“Then,” he continued, “then you’ll up, and you’ll say this: Gunn is a\\ngood man (you’ll say), and he puts a precious sight more confidence--a\\nprecious sight, mind that--in a gen’leman born than in these gen’leman\\nof fortune, having been one hisself.”\\n\\n“Well,” I said, “I don’t understand one word that you’ve been saying.\\nBut that’s neither here nor there; for how am I to get on board?”\\n\\n“Ah,” said he, “that’s the hitch, for sure. Well, there’s my boat, that\\nI made with my two hands. I keep her under the white rock. If the worst\\ncome to the worst, we might try that after dark. Hi!” he broke out.\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\nFor just then, although the sun had still an hour or two to run, all the\\nechoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon.\\n\\n“They have begun to fight!” I cried. “Follow me.”\\n\\nAnd I began to run towards the anchorage, my terrors all forgotten,\\nwhile close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily\\nand lightly.\\n\\n“Left, left,” says he; “keep to your left hand, mate Jim! Under the\\ntrees with you! Theer’s where I killed my first goat. They don’t come\\ndown here now; they’re all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear\\nof Benjamin Gunn. Ah! And there’s the cetemery”--cemetery, he must have\\nmeant. “You see the mounds? I come here and prayed, nows and thens, when\\nI thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren’t quite a chapel,\\nbut it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben Gunn was\\nshort-handed--no chapling, nor so much as a Bible and a flag, you says.”\\n\\nSo he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer.\\n\\nThe cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley\\nof small arms.\\n\\nAnother pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, I\\nbeheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART FOUR--The Stockade\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nNarrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned\\n\\nIT was about half past one--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two\\nboats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA. The captain, the squire, and I\\nwere talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind,\\nwe should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with\\nus, slipped our cable, and away to sea. But the wind was wanting; and\\nto complete our helplessness, down came Hunter with the news that Jim\\nHawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest.\\n\\nIt never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins, but we were alarmed for\\nhis safety. With the men in the temper they were in, it seemed an even\\nchance if we should see the lad again. We ran on deck. The pitch was\\nbubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick;\\nif ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it was in that abominable\\nanchorage. The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the\\nforecastle; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting\\nin each, hard by where the river runs in. One of them was whistling\\n“Lillibullero.”\\n\\nWaiting was a strain, and it was decided that Hunter and I should go\\nashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information.\\n\\nThe gigs had leaned to their right, but Hunter and I pulled straight in,\\nin the direction of the stockade upon the chart. The two who were\\nleft guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance;\\n“Lillibullero” stopped off, and I could see the pair discussing what\\nthey ought to do. Had they gone and told Silver, all might have turned\\nout differently; but they had their orders, I suppose, and decided to\\nsit quietly where they were and hark back again to “Lillibullero.”\\n\\nThere was a slight bend in the coast, and I steered so as to put it\\nbetween us; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs.\\nI jumped out and came as near running as I durst, with a big silk\\nhandkerchief under my hat for coolness’ sake and a brace of pistols\\nready primed for safety.\\n\\nI had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade.\\n\\nThis was how it was: a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a\\nknoll. Well, on the knoll, and enclosing the spring, they had clapped a\\nstout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed\\nfor musketry on either side. All round this they had cleared a wide\\nspace, and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high,\\nwithout door or opening, too strong to pull down without time and labour\\nand too open to shelter the besiegers. The people in the log-house had\\nthem in every way; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like\\npartridges. All they wanted was a good watch and food; for, short of a\\ncomplete surprise, they might have held the place against a regiment.\\n\\nWhat particularly took my fancy was the spring. For though we had a good\\nenough place of it in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, with plenty of arms\\nand ammunition, and things to eat, and excellent wines, there had been\\none thing overlooked--we had no water. I was thinking this over when\\nthere came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of\\ndeath. I was not new to violent death--I have served his Royal Highness\\nthe Duke of Cumberland, and got a wound myself at Fontenoy--but I know\\nmy pulse went dot and carry one. “Jim Hawkins is gone,” was my first\\nthought.\\n\\nIt is something to have been an old soldier, but more still to have been\\na doctor. There is no time to dilly-dally in our work. And so now I made\\nup my mind instantly, and with no time lost returned to the shore and\\njumped on board the jolly-boat.\\n\\nBy good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar. We made the water fly, and the\\nboat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner.\\n\\nI found them all shaken, as was natural. The squire was sitting down, as\\nwhite as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to, the good soul!\\nAnd one of the six forecastle hands was little better.\\n\\n“There’s a man,” says Captain Smollett, nodding towards him, “new to\\nthis work. He came nigh-hand fainting, doctor, when he heard the cry.\\nAnother touch of the rudder and that man would join us.”\\n\\nI told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled on the details\\nof its accomplishment.\\n\\nWe put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle,\\nwith three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection. Hunter\\nbrought the boat round under the stern-port, and Joyce and I set to work\\nloading her with powder tins, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs of pork, a\\ncask of cognac, and my invaluable medicine chest.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the squire and the captain stayed on deck, and the\\nlatter hailed the coxswain, who was the principal man aboard.\\n\\n“Mr. Hands,” he said, “here are two of us with a brace of pistols each.\\nIf any one of you six make a signal of any description, that man’s\\ndead.”\\n\\nThey were a good deal taken aback, and after a little consultation one\\nand all tumbled down the fore companion, thinking no doubt to take us\\non the rear. But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred\\ngalley, they went about ship at once, and a head popped out again on\\ndeck.\\n\\n“Down, dog!” cries the captain.\\n\\nAnd the head popped back again; and we heard no more, for the time, of\\nthese six very faint-hearted seamen.\\n\\nBy this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the jolly-boat\\nloaded as much as we dared. Joyce and I got out through the stern-port,\\nand we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us.\\n\\nThis second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. “Lillibullero”\\n was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of them behind the\\nlittle point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared. I had half a\\nmind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver\\nand the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost\\nby trying for too much.\\n\\nWe had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to\\nprovision the block house. All three made the first journey, heavily\\nladen, and tossed our stores over the palisade. Then, leaving Joyce to\\nguard them--one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets--Hunter\\nand I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more. So\\nwe proceeded without pausing to take breath, till the whole cargo was\\nbestowed, when the two servants took up their position in the block\\nhouse, and I, with all my power, sculled back to the HISPANIOLA.\\n\\nThat we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it\\nreally was. They had the advantage of numbers, of course, but we had the\\nadvantage of arms. Not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before\\nthey could get within range for pistol shooting, we flattered ourselves\\nwe should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least.\\n\\nThe squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all his faintness\\ngone from him. He caught the painter and made it fast, and we fell to\\nloading the boat for our very lives. Pork, powder, and biscuit was the\\ncargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me\\nand Redruth and the captain. The rest of the arms and powder we dropped\\noverboard in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see\\nthe bright steel shining far below us in the sun, on the clean, sandy\\nbottom.\\n\\nBy this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was swinging\\nround to her anchor. Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the\\ndirection of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for Joyce and\\nHunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off.\\n\\nRedruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the\\nboat, which we then brought round to the ship’s counter, to be handier\\nfor Captain Smollett.\\n\\n“Now, men,” said he, “do you hear me?”\\n\\nThere was no answer from the forecastle.\\n\\n“It’s to you, Abraham Gray--it’s to you I am speaking.”\\n\\nStill no reply.\\n\\n“Gray,” resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder, “I am leaving this ship,\\nand I order you to follow your captain. I know you are a good man at\\nbottom, and I dare say not one of the lot of you’s as bad as he makes\\nout. I have my watch here in my hand; I give you thirty seconds to join\\nme in.”\\n\\nThere was a pause.\\n\\n“Come, my fine fellow,” continued the captain; “don’t hang so long in\\nstays. I’m risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every\\nsecond.”\\n\\nThere was a sudden scuffle, a sound of blows, and out burst Abraham\\nGray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek, and came running to the\\ncaptain like a dog to the whistle.\\n\\n“I’m with you, sir,” said he.\\n\\nAnd the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us, and we\\nhad shoved off and given way.\\n\\nWe were clear out of the ship, but not yet ashore in our stockade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\nNarrative Continued by the Doctor: The Jolly-boat’s Last Trip\\n\\nTHIS fifth trip was quite different from any of the others. In the\\nfirst place, the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely\\noverloaded. Five grown men, and three of them--Trelawney, Redruth, and\\nthe captain--over six feet high, was already more than she was meant\\nto carry. Add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags. The gunwale was\\nlipping astern. Several times we shipped a little water, and my breeches\\nand the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a\\nhundred yards.\\n\\nThe captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a little more\\nevenly. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.\\n\\nIn the second place, the ebb was now making--a strong rippling current\\nrunning westward through the basin, and then south’ard and seaward down\\nthe straits by which we had entered in the morning. Even the ripples\\nwere a danger to our overloaded craft, but the worst of it was that we\\nwere swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place\\nbehind the point. If we let the current have its way we should come\\nashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at any moment.\\n\\n“I cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir,” said I to the captain.\\nI was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars.\\n“The tide keeps washing her down. Could you pull a little stronger?”\\n\\n“Not without swamping the boat,” said he. “You must bear up, sir, if you\\nplease--bear up until you see you’re gaining.”\\n\\nI tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward\\nuntil I had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to the\\nway we ought to go.\\n\\n“We’ll never get ashore at this rate,” said I.\\n\\n“If it’s the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie it,”\\n returned the captain. “We must keep upstream. You see, sir,” he went on,\\n“if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it’s hard to say\\nwhere we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the\\ngigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can\\ndodge back along the shore.”\\n\\n“The current’s less a’ready, sir,” said the man Gray, who was sitting in\\nthe fore-sheets; “you can ease her off a bit.”\\n\\n“Thank you, my man,” said I, quite as if nothing had happened, for we\\nhad all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves.\\n\\nSuddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was a\\nlittle changed.\\n\\n“The gun!” said he.\\n\\n“I have thought of that,” said I, for I made sure he was thinking of a\\nbombardment of the fort. “They could never get the gun ashore, and if\\nthey did, they could never haul it through the woods.”\\n\\n“Look astern, doctor,” replied the captain.\\n\\nWe had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our horror, were\\nthe five rogues busy about her, getting off her jacket, as they called\\nthe stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed. Not only that, but\\nit flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the\\npowder for the gun had been left behind, and a stroke with an axe would\\nput it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad.\\n\\n“Israel was Flint’s gunner,” said Gray hoarsely.\\n\\nAt any risk, we put the boat’s head direct for the landing-place. By\\nthis time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept\\nsteerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing, and I could\\nkeep her steady for the goal. But the worst of it was that with the\\ncourse I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the\\nHISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door.\\n\\nI could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands\\nplumping down a round-shot on the deck.\\n\\n“Who’s the best shot?” asked the captain.\\n\\n“Mr. Trelawney, out and away,” said I.\\n\\n“Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir?\\nHands, if possible,” said the captain.\\n\\nTrelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his gun.\\n\\n“Now,” cried the captain, “easy with that gun, sir, or you’ll swamp the\\nboat. All hands stand by to trim her when he aims.”\\n\\nThe squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over to the\\nother side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely contrived that we\\ndid not ship a drop.\\n\\nThey had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel, and Hands,\\nwho was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in consequence the most\\nexposed. However, we had no luck, for just as Trelawney fired, down he\\nstooped, the ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four\\nwho fell.\\n\\nThe cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a\\ngreat number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction\\nI saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling\\ninto their places in the boats.\\n\\n“Here come the gigs, sir,” said I.\\n\\n“Give way, then,” cried the captain. “We mustn’t mind if we swamp her\\nnow. If we can’t get ashore, all’s up.”\\n\\n“Only one of the gigs is being manned, sir,” I added; “the crew of the\\nother most likely going round by shore to cut us off.”\\n\\n“They’ll have a hot run, sir,” returned the captain. “Jack ashore, you\\nknow. It’s not them I mind; it’s the round-shot. Carpet bowls! My lady’s\\nmaid couldn’t miss. Tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we’ll\\nhold water.”\\n\\nIn the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so\\noverloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the process. We were\\nnow close in; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her, for the\\nebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering\\ntrees. The gig was no longer to be feared; the little point had already\\nconcealed it from our eyes. The ebb-tide, which had so cruelly delayed\\nus, was now making reparation and delaying our assailants. The one\\nsource of danger was the gun.\\n\\n“If I durst,” said the captain, “I’d stop and pick off another man.”\\n\\nBut it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot. They\\nhad never so much as looked at their fallen comrade, though he was not\\ndead, and I could see him trying to crawl away.\\n\\n“Ready!” cried the squire.\\n\\n“Hold!” cried the captain, quick as an echo.\\n\\nAnd he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily\\nunder water. The report fell in at the same instant of time. This was\\nthe first that Jim heard, the sound of the squire’s shot not having\\nreached him. Where the ball passed, not one of us precisely knew, but I\\nfancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have\\ncontributed to our disaster.\\n\\nAt any rate, the boat sank by the stern, quite gently, in three feet of\\nwater, leaving the captain and myself, facing each other, on our feet.\\nThe other three took complete headers, and came up again drenched and\\nbubbling.\\n\\nSo far there was no great harm. No lives were lost, and we could wade\\nashore in safety. But there were all our stores at the bottom, and to\\nmake things worse, only two guns out of five remained in a state for\\nservice. Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head, by\\na sort of instinct. As for the captain, he had carried his over his\\nshoulder by a bandoleer, and like a wise man, lock uppermost. The other\\nthree had gone down with the boat.\\n\\nTo add to our concern, we heard voices already drawing near us in the\\nwoods along shore, and we had not only the danger of being cut off from\\nthe stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether,\\nif Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen, they would have the\\nsense and conduct to stand firm. Hunter was steady, that we knew; Joyce\\nwas a doubtful case--a pleasant, polite man for a valet and to brush\\none’s clothes, but not entirely fitted for a man of war.\\n\\nWith all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving\\nbehind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and\\nprovisions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\nNarrative Continued by the Doctor: End of the First Day’s Fighting\\n\\nWE made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from\\nthe stockade, and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers\\nrang nearer. Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the\\ncracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket.\\n\\nI began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my\\npriming.\\n\\n“Captain,” said I, “Trelawney is the dead shot. Give him your gun; his\\nown is useless.”\\n\\nThey exchanged guns, and Trelawney, silent and cool as he had been since\\nthe beginning of the bustle, hung a moment on his heel to see that all\\nwas fit for service. At the same time, observing Gray to be unarmed, I\\nhanded him my cutlass. It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his\\nhand, knit his brows, and make the blade sing through the air. It was\\nplain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt.\\n\\nForty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade\\nin front of us. We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south\\nside, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers--Job Anderson, the\\nboatswain, at their head--appeared in full cry at the southwestern\\ncorner.\\n\\nThey paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not only the\\nsquire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the block house, had time to\\nfire. The four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did\\nthe business: one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without\\nhesitation, turned and plunged into the trees.\\n\\nAfter reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to\\nthe fallen enemy. He was stone dead--shot through the heart.\\n\\nWe began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a\\npistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my ear, and poor\\nTom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground. Both the squire\\nand I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable\\nwe only wasted powder. Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor\\nTom.\\n\\nThe captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an\\neye that all was over.\\n\\nI believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers\\nonce more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the\\npoor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and\\nbleeding, into the log-house.\\n\\nPoor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint,\\nfear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till\\nnow, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die. He had lain like\\na Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order\\nsilently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score\\nof years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was\\nto die.\\n\\nThe squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand,\\ncrying like a child.\\n\\n“Be I going, doctor?” he asked.\\n\\n“Tom, my man,” said I, “you’re going home.”\\n\\n“I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,” he replied.\\n\\n“Tom,” said the squire, “say you forgive me, won’t you?”\\n\\n“Would that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?” was the answer.\\n“Howsoever, so be it, amen!”\\n\\nAfter a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody might read\\na prayer. “It’s the custom, sir,” he added apologetically. And not long\\nafter, without another word, he passed away.\\n\\nIn the meantime the captain, whom I had observed to be wonderfully\\nswollen about the chest and pockets, had turned out a great many various\\nstores--the British colours, a Bible, a coil of stoutish rope, pen, ink,\\nthe log-book, and pounds of tobacco. He had found a longish fir-tree\\nlying felled and trimmed in the enclosure, and with the help of Hunter\\nhe had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed\\nand made an angle. Then, climbing on the roof, he had with his own hand\\nbent and run up the colours.\\n\\nThis seemed mightily to relieve him. He re-entered the log-house and set\\nabout counting up the stores as if nothing else existed. But he had an\\neye on Tom’s passage for all that, and as soon as all was over, came\\nforward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body.\\n\\n“Don’t you take on, sir,” he said, shaking the squire’s hand. “All’s\\nwell with him; no fear for a hand that’s been shot down in his duty to\\ncaptain and owner. It mayn’t be good divinity, but it’s a fact.”\\n\\nThen he pulled me aside.\\n\\n“Dr. Livesey,” he said, “in how many weeks do you and squire expect the\\nconsort?”\\n\\nI told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if we\\nwere not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us, but\\nneither sooner nor later. “You can calculate for yourself,” I said.\\n\\n“Why, yes,” returned the captain, scratching his head; “and making a\\nlarge allowance, sir, for all the gifts of Providence, I should say we\\nwere pretty close hauled.”\\n\\n“How do you mean?” I asked.\\n\\n“It’s a pity, sir, we lost that second load. That’s what I mean,”\\n replied the captain. “As for powder and shot, we’ll do. But the rations\\nare short, very short--so short, Dr. Livesey, that we’re perhaps as well\\nwithout that extra mouth.”\\n\\nAnd he pointed to the dead body under the flag.\\n\\nJust then, with a roar and a whistle, a round-shot passed high above the\\nroof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood.\\n\\n“Oho!” said the captain. “Blaze away! You’ve little enough powder\\nalready, my lads.”\\n\\nAt the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball descended inside\\nthe stockade, scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage.\\n\\n“Captain,” said the squire, “the house is quite invisible from the ship.\\nIt must be the flag they are aiming at. Would it not be wiser to take it\\nin?”\\n\\n“Strike my colours!” cried the captain. “No, sir, not I”; and as soon\\nas he had said the words, I think we all agreed with him. For it was\\nnot only a piece of stout, seamanly, good feeling; it was good policy\\nbesides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade.\\n\\nAll through the evening they kept thundering away. Ball after ball flew\\nover or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure, but they had\\nto fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft\\nsand. We had no ricochet to fear, and though one popped in through the\\nroof of the log-house and out again through the floor, we soon got used\\nto that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket.\\n\\n“There is one good thing about all this,” observed the captain; “the\\nwood in front of us is likely clear. The ebb has made a good while; our\\nstores should be uncovered. Volunteers to go and bring in pork.”\\n\\nGray and Hunter were the first to come forward. Well armed, they stole\\nout of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. The mutineers were\\nbolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel’s gunnery. For\\nfour or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out\\nwith them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to\\nhold her steady against the current. Silver was in the stern-sheets in\\ncommand; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some\\nsecret magazine of their own.\\n\\nThe captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry:\\n\\n     Alexander Smollett, master; David Livesey, ship’s\\n     doctor; Abraham Gray, carpenter’s mate; John\\n     Trelawney, owner; John Hunter and Richard Joyce,\\n     owner’s servants, landsmen--being all that is left\\n     faithful of the ship’s company--with stores for ten\\n     days at short rations, came ashore this day and flew\\n     British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island.\\n     Thomas Redruth, owner’s servant, landsman, shot by the\\n     mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy--\\n\\nAnd at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins’ fate.\\n\\nA hail on the land side.\\n\\n“Somebody hailing us,” said Hunter, who was on guard.\\n\\n“Doctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?” came the cries.\\n\\nAnd I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come\\nclimbing over the stockade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\nNarrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade\\n\\nAS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the\\narm, and sat down.\\n\\n“Now,” said he, “there’s your friends, sure enough.”\\n\\n“Far more likely it’s the mutineers,” I answered.\\n\\n“That!” he cried. “Why, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but\\ngen’lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don’t make\\nno doubt of that. No, that’s your friends. There’s been blows too, and I\\nreckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in\\nthe old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint. Ah, he was\\nthe man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match were\\nnever seen. He were afraid of none, not he; on’y Silver--Silver was that\\ngenteel.”\\n\\n“Well,” said I, “that may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that\\nI should hurry on and join my friends.”\\n\\n“Nay, mate,” returned Ben, “not you. You’re a good boy, or I’m mistook;\\nbut you’re on’y a boy, all told. Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn’t\\nbring me there, where you’re going--not rum wouldn’t, till I see your\\nborn gen’leman and gets it on his word of honour. And you won’t forget\\nmy words; ‘A precious sight (that’s what you’ll say), a precious sight\\nmore confidence’--and then nips him.”\\n\\nAnd he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness.\\n\\n“And when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just\\nwheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing\\nin his hand, and he’s to come alone. Oh! And you’ll say this: ‘Ben\\nGunn,’ says you, ‘has reasons of his own.’”\\n\\n“Well,” said I, “I believe I understand. You have something to propose,\\nand you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you’re to be found\\nwhere I found you. Is that all?”\\n\\n“And when? says you,” he added. “Why, from about noon observation to\\nabout six bells.”\\n\\n“Good,” said I, “and now may I go?”\\n\\n“You won’t forget?” he inquired anxiously. “Precious sight, and reasons\\nof his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that’s the mainstay; as\\nbetween man and man. Well, then”--still holding me--“I reckon you can\\ngo, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn’t go for to sell\\nBen Gunn? Wild horses wouldn’t draw it from you? No, says you. And if\\nthem pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there’d be widders\\nin the morning?”\\n\\nHere he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing\\nthrough the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where\\nwe two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to his heels\\nin a different direction.\\n\\nFor a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and\\nballs kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to\\nhiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying\\nmissiles. But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst\\nnot venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell\\noftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and\\nafter a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees.\\n\\nThe sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the\\nwoods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was\\nfar out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat\\nof the day, chilled me through my jacket.\\n\\nThe HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough, there\\nwas the Jolly Roger--the black flag of piracy--flying from her peak.\\nEven as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that\\nsent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the\\nair. It was the last of the cannonade.\\n\\nI lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. Men\\nwere demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade--the\\npoor jolly-boat, I afterwards discovered. Away, near the mouth of the\\nriver, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point\\nand the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I\\nhad seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. But there was a\\nsound in their voices which suggested rum.\\n\\nAt length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was pretty\\nfar down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east,\\nand is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my\\nfeet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among\\nlow bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in\\ncolour. It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben\\nGunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I\\nshould know where to look for one.\\n\\nThen I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear, or\\nshoreward side, of the stockade, and was soon warmly welcomed by the\\nfaithful party.\\n\\nI had soon told my story and began to look about me. The log-house was\\nmade of unsquared trunks of pine--roof, walls, and floor. The latter\\nstood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the\\nsurface of the sand. There was a porch at the door, and under this porch\\nthe little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd\\nkind--no other than a great ship’s kettle of iron, with the bottom\\nknocked out, and sunk “to her bearings,” as the captain said, among the\\nsand.\\n\\nLittle had been left besides the framework of the house, but in one\\ncorner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old\\nrusty iron basket to contain the fire.\\n\\nThe slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been\\ncleared of timber to build the house, and we could see by the stumps\\nwhat a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed. Most of the soil had\\nbeen washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees; only\\nwhere the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and\\nsome ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand.\\nVery close around the stockade--too close for defence, they said--the\\nwood still flourished high and dense, all of fir on the land side, but\\ntowards the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks.\\n\\nThe cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken, whistled through every\\nchink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain\\nof fine sand. There was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in our\\nsuppers, sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle, for all\\nthe world like porridge beginning to boil. Our chimney was a square hole\\nin the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way\\nout, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping\\nthe eye.\\n\\nAdd to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage\\nfor a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor\\nold Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark,\\nunder the Union Jack.\\n\\nIf we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the\\nblues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that. All hands were\\ncalled up before him, and he divided us into watches. The doctor and\\nGray and I for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce upon the other. Tired\\nthough we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to\\ndig a grave for Redruth; the doctor was named cook; I was put sentry at\\nthe door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up\\nour spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted.\\n\\nFrom time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to\\nrest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head, and whenever he\\ndid so, he had a word for me.\\n\\n“That man Smollett,” he said once, “is a better man than I am. And when\\nI say that it means a deal, Jim.”\\n\\nAnother time he came and was silent for a while. Then he put his head on\\none side, and looked at me.\\n\\n“Is this Ben Gunn a man?” he asked.\\n\\n“I do not know, sir,” said I. “I am not very sure whether he’s sane.”\\n\\n“If there’s any doubt about the matter, he is,” returned the doctor. “A\\nman who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island, Jim,\\ncan’t expect to appear as sane as you or me. It doesn’t lie in human\\nnature. Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, cheese,” I answered.\\n\\n“Well, Jim,” says he, “just see the good that comes of being dainty in\\nyour food. You’ve seen my snuff-box, haven’t you? And you never saw me\\ntake snuff, the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of\\nParmesan cheese--a cheese made in Italy, very nutritious. Well, that’s\\nfor Ben Gunn!”\\n\\nBefore supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood round\\nhim for a while bare-headed in the breeze. A good deal of firewood had\\nbeen got in, but not enough for the captain’s fancy, and he shook his\\nhead over it and told us we “must get back to this tomorrow rather\\nlivelier.” Then, when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff\\nglass of brandy grog, the three chiefs got together in a corner to\\ndiscuss our prospects.\\n\\nIt appears they were at their wits’ end what to do, the stores being so\\nlow that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came.\\nBut our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until\\nthey either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA. From\\nnineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were wounded,\\nand one at least--the man shot beside the gun--severely wounded, if he\\nwere not dead. Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it,\\nsaving our own lives, with the extremest care. And besides that, we had\\ntwo able allies--rum and the climate.\\n\\nAs for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear\\nthem roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second,\\nthe doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were in the marsh\\nand unprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs\\nbefore a week.\\n\\n“So,” he added, “if we are not all shot down first they’ll be glad to\\nbe packing in the schooner. It’s always a ship, and they can get to\\nbuccaneering again, I suppose.”\\n\\n“First ship that ever I lost,” said Captain Smollett.\\n\\nI was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when I got to sleep, which was\\nnot till after a great deal of tossing, I slept like a log of wood.\\n\\nThe rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the\\npile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a\\nbustle and the sound of voices.\\n\\n“Flag of truce!” I heard someone say; and then, immediately after, with\\na cry of surprise, “Silver himself!”\\n\\nAnd at that, up I jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in the\\nwall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\nSilver’s Embassy\\n\\nSURE enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them\\nwaving a white cloth, the other, no less a person than Silver himself,\\nstanding placidly by.\\n\\nIt was still quite early, and the coldest morning that I think I ever\\nwas abroad in--a chill that pierced into the marrow. The sky was bright\\nand cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in\\nthe sun. But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in\\nshadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled\\nduring the night out of the morass. The chill and the vapour taken\\ntogether told a poor tale of the island. It was plainly a damp,\\nfeverish, unhealthy spot.\\n\\n“Keep indoors, men,” said the captain. “Ten to one this is a trick.”\\n\\nThen he hailed the buccaneer.\\n\\n“Who goes? Stand, or we fire.”\\n\\n“Flag of truce,” cried Silver.\\n\\nThe captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way\\nof a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned and spoke to\\nus, “Doctor’s watch on the lookout. Dr. Livesey take the north side,\\nif you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The watch below, all hands to\\nload muskets. Lively, men, and careful.”\\n\\nAnd then he turned again to the mutineers.\\n\\n“And what do you want with your flag of truce?” he cried.\\n\\nThis time it was the other man who replied.\\n\\n“Cap’n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,” he shouted.\\n\\n“Cap’n Silver! Don’t know him. Who’s he?” cried the captain. And we\\ncould hear him adding to himself, “Cap’n, is it? My heart, and here’s\\npromotion!”\\n\\nLong John answered for himself. “Me, sir. These poor lads have chosen me\\ncap’n, after your desertion, sir”--laying a particular emphasis upon the\\nword “desertion.” “We’re willing to submit, if we can come to terms,\\nand no bones about it. All I ask is your word, Cap’n Smollett, to let me\\nsafe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o’\\nshot before a gun is fired.”\\n\\n“My man,” said Captain Smollett, “I have not the slightest desire to\\ntalk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that’s all. If\\nthere’s any treachery, it’ll be on your side, and the Lord help you.”\\n\\n“That’s enough, cap’n,” shouted Long John cheerily. “A word from you’s\\nenough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.”\\n\\nWe could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold\\nSilver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the\\ncaptain’s answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the\\nback as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the\\nstockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour\\nand skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the\\nother side.\\n\\nI will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on\\nto be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, I had already deserted\\nmy eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had now seated\\nhimself on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his\\nhands, and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron\\nkettle in the sand. He was whistling “Come, Lasses and Lads.”\\n\\nSilver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll. What with the\\nsteepness of the incline, the thick tree stumps, and the soft sand, he\\nand his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays. But he stuck to it\\nlike a man in silence, and at last arrived before the captain, whom\\nhe saluted in the handsomest style. He was tricked out in his best;\\nan immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his\\nknees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head.\\n\\n“Here you are, my man,” said the captain, raising his head. “You had\\nbetter sit down.”\\n\\n“You ain’t a-going to let me inside, cap’n?” complained Long John. “It’s\\na main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.”\\n\\n“Why, Silver,” said the captain, “if you had pleased to be an honest\\nman, you might have been sitting in your galley. It’s your own doing.\\nYou’re either my ship’s cook--and then you were treated handsome--or\\nCap’n Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!”\\n\\n“Well, well, cap’n,” returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was\\nbidden on the sand, “you’ll have to give me a hand up again, that’s all.\\nA sweet pretty place you have of it here. Ah, there’s Jim! The top of\\nthe morning to you, Jim. Doctor, here’s my service. Why, there you all\\nare together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.”\\n\\n“If you have anything to say, my man, better say it,” said the captain.\\n\\n“Right you were, Cap’n Smollett,” replied Silver. “Dooty is dooty, to be\\nsure. Well now, you look here, that was a good lay of yours last\\nnight. I don’t deny it was a good lay. Some of you pretty handy with a\\nhandspike-end. And I’ll not deny neither but what some of my people was\\nshook--maybe all was shook; maybe I was shook myself; maybe that’s\\nwhy I’m here for terms. But you mark me, cap’n, it won’t do twice, by\\nthunder! We’ll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the\\nrum. Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind’s eye. But I’ll\\ntell you I was sober; I was on’y dog tired; and if I’d awoke a second\\nsooner, I’d ’a caught you at the act, I would. He wasn’t dead when I got\\nround to him, not he.”\\n\\n“Well?” says Captain Smollett as cool as can be.\\n\\nAll that Silver said was a riddle to him, but you would never have\\nguessed it from his tone. As for me, I began to have an inkling. Ben\\nGunn’s last words came back to my mind. I began to suppose that he had\\npaid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round\\ntheir fire, and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen\\nenemies to deal with.\\n\\n“Well, here it is,” said Silver. “We want that treasure, and we’ll have\\nit--that’s our point! You would just as soon save your lives, I reckon;\\nand that’s yours. You have a chart, haven’t you?”\\n\\n“That’s as may be,” replied the captain.\\n\\n“Oh, well, you have, I know that,” returned Long John. “You needn’t be\\nso husky with a man; there ain’t a particle of service in that, and you\\nmay lay to it. What I mean is, we want your chart. Now, I never meant\\nyou no harm, myself.”\\n\\n“That won’t do with me, my man,” interrupted the captain. “We know\\nexactly what you meant to do, and we don’t care, for now, you see, you\\ncan’t do it.”\\n\\nAnd the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe.\\n\\n“If Abe Gray--” Silver broke out.\\n\\n“Avast there!” cried Mr. Smollett. “Gray told me nothing, and I asked\\nhim nothing; and what’s more, I would see you and him and this whole\\nisland blown clean out of the water into blazes first. So there’s my\\nmind for you, my man, on that.”\\n\\nThis little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down. He had been\\ngrowing nettled before, but now he pulled himself together.\\n\\n“Like enough,” said he. “I would set no limits to what gentlemen might\\nconsider shipshape, or might not, as the case were. And seein’ as how\\nyou are about to take a pipe, cap’n, I’ll make so free as do likewise.”\\n\\nAnd he filled a pipe and lighted it; and the two men sat silently\\nsmoking for quite a while, now looking each other in the face, now\\nstopping their tobacco, now leaning forward to spit. It was as good as\\nthe play to see them.\\n\\n“Now,” resumed Silver, “here it is. You give us the chart to get the\\ntreasure by, and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in\\nwhile asleep. You do that, and we’ll offer you a choice. Either you come\\naboard along of us, once the treasure shipped, and then I’ll give you my\\naffy-davy, upon my word of honour, to clap you somewhere safe ashore. Or\\nif that ain’t to your fancy, some of my hands being rough and having\\nold scores on account of hazing, then you can stay here, you can. We’ll\\ndivide stores with you, man for man; and I’ll give my affy-davy, as\\nbefore to speak the first ship I sight, and send ’em here to pick you\\nup. Now, you’ll own that’s talking. Handsomer you couldn’t look to get,\\nnow you. And I hope”--raising his voice--“that all hands in this here\\nblock house will overhaul my words, for what is spoke to one is spoke to\\nall.”\\n\\nCaptain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his\\npipe in the palm of his left hand.\\n\\n“Is that all?” he asked.\\n\\n“Every last word, by thunder!” answered John. “Refuse that, and you’ve\\nseen the last of me but musket-balls.”\\n\\n“Very good,” said the captain. “Now you’ll hear me. If you’ll come up\\none by one, unarmed, I’ll engage to clap you all in irons and take you\\nhome to a fair trial in England. If you won’t, my name is Alexander\\nSmollett, I’ve flown my sovereign’s colours, and I’ll see you all\\nto Davy Jones. You can’t find the treasure. You can’t sail the\\nship--there’s not a man among you fit to sail the ship. You can’t fight\\nus--Gray, there, got away from five of you. Your ship’s in irons, Master\\nSilver; you’re on a lee shore, and so you’ll find. I stand here and tell\\nyou so; and they’re the last good words you’ll get from me, for in the\\nname of heaven, I’ll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you.\\nTramp, my lad. Bundle out of this, please, hand over hand, and double\\nquick.”\\n\\nSilver’s face was a picture; his eyes started in his head with wrath. He\\nshook the fire out of his pipe.\\n\\n“Give me a hand up!” he cried.\\n\\n“Not I,” returned the captain.\\n\\n“Who’ll give me a hand up?” he roared.\\n\\nNot a man among us moved. Growling the foulest imprecations, he crawled\\nalong the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself\\nagain upon his crutch. Then he spat into the spring.\\n\\n“There!” he cried. “That’s what I think of ye. Before an hour’s out,\\nI’ll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon. Laugh, by\\nthunder, laugh! Before an hour’s out, ye’ll laugh upon the other side.\\nThem that die’ll be the lucky ones.”\\n\\nAnd with a dreadful oath he stumbled off, ploughed down the sand, was\\nhelped across the stockade, after four or five failures, by the man with\\nthe flag of truce, and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the\\ntrees.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nThe Attack\\n\\nAS soon as Silver disappeared, the captain, who had been closely\\nwatching him, turned towards the interior of the house and found not a\\nman of us at his post but Gray. It was the first time we had ever seen\\nhim angry.\\n\\n“Quarters!” he roared. And then, as we all slunk back to our places,\\n“Gray,” he said, “I’ll put your name in the log; you’ve stood by your\\nduty like a seaman. Mr. Trelawney, I’m surprised at you, sir. Doctor,\\nI thought you had worn the king’s coat! If that was how you served at\\nFontenoy, sir, you’d have been better in your berth.”\\n\\nThe doctor’s watch were all back at their loopholes, the rest were busy\\nloading the spare muskets, and everyone with a red face, you may be\\ncertain, and a flea in his ear, as the saying is.\\n\\nThe captain looked on for a while in silence. Then he spoke.\\n\\n“My lads,” said he, “I’ve given Silver a broadside. I pitched it in\\nred-hot on purpose; and before the hour’s out, as he said, we shall be\\nboarded. We’re outnumbered, I needn’t tell you that, but we fight in\\nshelter; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline.\\nI’ve no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if you choose.”\\n\\nThen he went the rounds and saw, as he said, that all was clear.\\n\\nOn the two short sides of the house, east and west, there were only two\\nloopholes; on the south side where the porch was, two again; and on the\\nnorth side, five. There was a round score of muskets for the seven\\nof us; the firewood had been built into four piles--tables, you might\\nsay--one about the middle of each side, and on each of these tables some\\nammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the\\ndefenders. In the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged.\\n\\n“Toss out the fire,” said the captain; “the chill is past, and we\\nmustn’t have smoke in our eyes.”\\n\\nThe iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney, and the\\nembers smothered among sand.\\n\\n“Hawkins hasn’t had his breakfast. Hawkins, help yourself, and back to\\nyour post to eat it,” continued Captain Smollett. “Lively, now, my lad;\\nyou’ll want it before you’ve done. Hunter, serve out a round of brandy\\nto all hands.”\\n\\nAnd while this was going on, the captain completed, in his own mind, the\\nplan of the defence.\\n\\n“Doctor, you will take the door,” he resumed. “See, and don’t expose\\nyourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. Hunter, take the east\\nside, there. Joyce, you stand by the west, my man. Mr. Trelawney, you\\nare the best shot--you and Gray will take this long north side, with the\\nfive loopholes; it’s there the danger is. If they can get up to it and\\nfire in upon us through our own ports, things would begin to look dirty.\\nHawkins, neither you nor I are much account at the shooting; we’ll stand\\nby to load and bear a hand.”\\n\\nAs the captain had said, the chill was past. As soon as the sun had\\nclimbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the\\nclearing and drank up the vapours at a draught. Soon the sand was baking\\nand the resin melting in the logs of the block house. Jackets and coats\\nwere flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the\\nshoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of heat and\\nanxiety.\\n\\nAn hour passed away.\\n\\n“Hang them!” said the captain. “This is as dull as the doldrums. Gray,\\nwhistle for a wind.”\\n\\nAnd just at that moment came the first news of the attack.\\n\\n“If you please, sir,” said Joyce, “if I see anyone, am I to fire?”\\n\\n“I told you so!” cried the captain.\\n\\n“Thank you, sir,” returned Joyce with the same quiet civility.\\n\\nNothing followed for a time, but the remark had set us all on the alert,\\nstraining ears and eyes--the musketeers with their pieces balanced in\\ntheir hands, the captain out in the middle of the block house with his\\nmouth very tight and a frown on his face.\\n\\nSo some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket\\nand fired. The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and\\nrepeated from without in a scattering volley, shot behind shot, like\\na string of geese, from every side of the enclosure. Several bullets\\nstruck the log-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away\\nand vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and\\nempty as before. Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel\\nbetrayed the presence of our foes.\\n\\n“Did you hit your man?” asked the captain.\\n\\n“No, sir,” replied Joyce. “I believe not, sir.”\\n\\n“Next best thing to tell the truth,” muttered Captain Smollett. “Load\\nhis gun, Hawkins. How many should say there were on your side, doctor?”\\n\\n“I know precisely,” said Dr. Livesey. “Three shots were fired on this\\nside. I saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the\\nwest.”\\n\\n“Three!” repeated the captain. “And how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?”\\n\\nBut this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the\\nnorth--seven by the squire’s computation, eight or nine according to\\nGray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was\\nplain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and\\nthat on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of\\nhostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements. If\\nthe mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would\\ntake possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats\\nin our own stronghold.\\n\\nNor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a loud\\nhuzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side\\nand ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment, the fire was once\\nmore opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway\\nand knocked the doctor’s musket into bits.\\n\\nThe boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and Gray fired\\nagain and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into the enclosure,\\ntwo back on the outside. But of these, one was evidently more frightened\\nthan hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly\\ndisappeared among the trees.\\n\\nTwo had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing\\ninside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight\\nmen, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though\\nuseless fire on the log-house.\\n\\nThe four who had boarded made straight before them for the building,\\nshouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted back to\\nencourage them. Several shots were fired, but such was the hurry of the\\nmarksmen that not one appears to have taken effect. In a moment, the\\nfour pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us.\\n\\nThe head of Job Anderson, the boatswain, appeared at the middle\\nloophole.\\n\\n“At ’em, all hands--all hands!” he roared in a voice of thunder.\\n\\nAt the same moment, another pirate grasped Hunter’s musket by the\\nmuzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the loophole,\\nand with one stunning blow, laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor.\\nMeanwhile a third, running unharmed all around the house, appeared\\nsuddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor.\\n\\nOur position was utterly reversed. A moment since we were firing, under\\ncover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay uncovered and could\\nnot return a blow.\\n\\nThe log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our comparative\\nsafety. Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of pistol-shots,\\nand one loud groan rang in my ears.\\n\\n“Out, lads, out, and fight ’em in the open! Cutlasses!” cried the\\ncaptain.\\n\\nI snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same time\\nsnatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly\\nfelt. I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight. Someone was\\nclose behind, I knew not whom. Right in front, the doctor was pursuing\\nhis assailant down the hill, and just as my eyes fell upon him, beat\\ndown his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash\\nacross the face.\\n\\n“Round the house, lads! Round the house!” cried the captain; and even in\\nthe hurly-burly, I perceived a change in his voice.\\n\\nMechanically, I obeyed, turned eastwards, and with my cutlass raised,\\nran round the corner of the house. Next moment I was face to face\\nwith Anderson. He roared aloud, and his hanger went up above his head,\\nflashing in the sunlight. I had not time to be afraid, but as the blow\\nstill hung impending, leaped in a trice upon one side, and missing my\\nfoot in the soft sand, rolled headlong down the slope.\\n\\nWhen I had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers had been\\nalready swarming up the palisade to make an end of us. One man, in a red\\nnight-cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even got upon the top and\\nthrown a leg across. Well, so short had been the interval that when I\\nfound my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow with the red\\nnight-cap still half-way over, another still just showing his head above\\nthe top of the stockade. And yet, in this breath of time, the fight was\\nover and the victory was ours.\\n\\nGray, following close behind me, had cut down the big boatswain ere\\nhe had time to recover from his last blow. Another had been shot at a\\nloophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony,\\nthe pistol still smoking in his hand. A third, as I had seen, the doctor\\nhad disposed of at a blow. Of the four who had scaled the palisade, one\\nonly remained unaccounted for, and he, having left his cutlass on the\\nfield, was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him.\\n\\n“Fire--fire from the house!” cried the doctor. “And you, lads, back into\\ncover.”\\n\\nBut his words were unheeded, no shot was fired, and the last boarder\\nmade good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood. In\\nthree seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who\\nhad fallen, four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade.\\n\\nThe doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter. The survivors\\nwould soon be back where they had left their muskets, and at any moment\\nthe fire might recommence.\\n\\nThe house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke, and we saw at\\na glance the price we had paid for victory. Hunter lay beside his\\nloophole, stunned; Joyce by his, shot through the head, never to move\\nagain; while right in the centre, the squire was supporting the captain,\\none as pale as the other.\\n\\n“The captain’s wounded,” said Mr. Trelawney.\\n\\n“Have they run?” asked Mr. Smollett.\\n\\n“All that could, you may be bound,” returned the doctor; “but there’s\\nfive of them will never run again.”\\n\\n“Five!” cried the captain. “Come, that’s better. Five against three\\nleaves us four to nine. That’s better odds than we had at starting. We\\nwere seven to nineteen then, or thought we were, and that’s as bad to\\nbear.” *\\n\\n*The mutineers were soon only eight in number, for the man shot by Mr.\\nTrelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound. But\\nthis was, of course, not known till after by the faithful party.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART FIVE--My Sea Adventure\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\nHow My Sea Adventure Began\\n\\nTHERE was no return of the mutineers--not so much as another shot out of\\nthe woods. They had “got their rations for that day,” as the captain put\\nit, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the\\nwounded and get dinner. Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the\\ndanger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for\\nhorror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor’s patients.\\n\\nOut of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still\\nbreathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole,\\nHunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these, the first two were as good\\nas dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor’s knife, and Hunter,\\ndo what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. He\\nlingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his\\napoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the\\nblow and his skull fractured in falling, and some time in the following\\nnight, without sign or sound, he went to his Maker.\\n\\nAs for the captain, his wounds were grievous indeed, but not dangerous.\\nNo organ was fatally injured. Anderson’s ball--for it was Job that\\nshot him first--had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung, not\\nbadly; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf.\\nHe was sure to recover, the doctor said, but in the meantime, and for\\nweeks to come, he must not walk nor move his arm, nor so much as speak\\nwhen he could help it.\\n\\nMy own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite. Doctor\\nLivesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the\\nbargain.\\n\\nAfter dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain’s side awhile\\nin consultation; and when they had talked to their hearts’ content, it\\nbeing then a little past noon, the doctor took up his hat and pistols,\\ngirt on a cutlass, put the chart in his pocket, and with a musket over\\nhis shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly\\nthrough the trees.\\n\\nGray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block house, to\\nbe out of earshot of our officers consulting; and Gray took his pipe out\\nof his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again, so thunder-struck\\nhe was at this occurrence.\\n\\n“Why, in the name of Davy Jones,” said he, “is Dr. Livesey mad?”\\n\\n“Why no,” says I. “He’s about the last of this crew for that, I take\\nit.”\\n\\n“Well, shipmate,” said Gray, “mad he may not be; but if HE’S not, you\\nmark my words, I am.”\\n\\n“I take it,” replied I, “the doctor has his idea; and if I am right,\\nhe’s going now to see Ben Gunn.”\\n\\nI was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house being\\nstifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze\\nwith midday sun, I began to get another thought into my head, which was\\nnot by any means so right. What I began to do was to envy the doctor\\nwalking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the\\npleasant smell of the pines, while I sat grilling, with my clothes\\nstuck to the hot resin, and so much blood about me and so many poor\\ndead bodies lying all around that I took a disgust of the place that was\\nalmost as strong as fear.\\n\\nAll the time I was washing out the block house, and then washing up\\nthe things from dinner, this disgust and envy kept growing stronger\\nand stronger, till at last, being near a bread-bag, and no one then\\nobserving me, I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both\\npockets of my coat with biscuit.\\n\\nI was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to do a foolish,\\nover-bold act; but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in\\nmy power. These biscuits, should anything befall me, would keep me, at\\nleast, from starving till far on in the next day.\\n\\nThe next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I already\\nhad a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well supplied with arms.\\n\\nAs for the scheme I had in my head, it was not a bad one in itself. I\\nwas to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east\\nfrom the open sea, find the white rock I had observed last evening, and\\nascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat,\\na thing quite worth doing, as I still believe. But as I was certain I\\nshould not be allowed to leave the enclosure, my only plan was to take\\nFrench leave and slip out when nobody was watching, and that was so bad\\na way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong. But I was only a boy,\\nand I had made my mind up.\\n\\nWell, as things at last fell out, I found an admirable opportunity. The\\nsquire and Gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages, the\\ncoast was clear, I made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the\\nthickest of the trees, and before my absence was observed I was out of\\ncry of my companions.\\n\\nThis was my second folly, far worse than the first, as I left but two\\nsound men to guard the house; but like the first, it was a help towards\\nsaving all of us.\\n\\nI took my way straight for the east coast of the island, for I was\\ndetermined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of\\nobservation from the anchorage. It was already late in the afternoon,\\nalthough still warm and sunny. As I continued to thread the tall woods,\\nI could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the\\nsurf, but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which\\nshowed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual. Soon cool\\ndraughts of air began to reach me, and a few steps farther I came forth\\ninto the open borders of the grove, and saw the sea lying blue and sunny\\nto the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the\\nbeach.\\n\\nI have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island. The sun might\\nblaze overhead, the air be without a breath, the surface smooth and\\nblue, but still these great rollers would be running along all the\\nexternal coast, thundering and thundering by day and night; and I scarce\\nbelieve there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of\\nearshot of their noise.\\n\\nI walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment, till, thinking\\nI was now got far enough to the south, I took the cover of some thick\\nbushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit.\\n\\nBehind me was the sea, in front the anchorage. The sea breeze, as though\\nit had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence, was already\\nat an end; it had been succeeded by light, variable airs from the south\\nand south-east, carrying great banks of fog; and the anchorage, under\\nlee of Skeleton Island, lay still and leaden as when first we entered\\nit. The HISPANIOLA, in that unbroken mirror, was exactly portrayed from\\nthe truck to the waterline, the Jolly Roger hanging from her peak.\\n\\nAlongside lay one of the gigs, Silver in the stern-sheets--him I could\\nalways recognize--while a couple of men were leaning over the stern\\nbulwarks, one of them with a red cap--the very rogue that I had seen\\nsome hours before stride-legs upon the palisade. Apparently they were\\ntalking and laughing, though at that distance--upwards of a mile--I\\ncould, of course, hear no word of what was said. All at once there began\\nthe most horrid, unearthly screaming, which at first startled me badly,\\nthough I had soon remembered the voice of Captain Flint and even thought\\nI could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon\\nher master’s wrist.\\n\\nSoon after, the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore, and the man\\nwith the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion.\\n\\nJust about the same time, the sun had gone down behind the Spy-glass,\\nand as the fog was collecting rapidly, it began to grow dark in earnest.\\nI saw I must lose no time if I were to find the boat that evening.\\n\\nThe white rock, visible enough above the brush, was still some eighth of\\na mile further down the spit, and it took me a goodish while to get up\\nwith it, crawling, often on all fours, among the scrub. Night had almost\\ncome when I laid my hand on its rough sides. Right below it there was\\nan exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick\\nunderwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in the\\ncentre of the dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what\\nthe gipsies carry about with them in England.\\n\\nI dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was\\nBen Gunn’s boat--home-made if ever anything was home-made; a rude,\\nlop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of\\ngoat-skin, with the hair inside. The thing was extremely small, even\\nfor me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a\\nfull-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of\\nstretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion.\\n\\nI had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but\\nI have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn’s\\nboat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever\\nmade by man. But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly\\npossessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable.\\n\\nWell, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had\\nenough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another\\nnotion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried\\nit out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This was\\nto slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let\\nher go ashore where she fancied. I had quite made up my mind that the\\nmutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their\\nhearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be\\na fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their\\nwatchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little\\nrisk.\\n\\nDown I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. It\\nwas a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. The fog had now buried\\nall heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared,\\nabsolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when, at last,\\nI shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow\\nwhere I had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole\\nanchorage.\\n\\nOne was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay\\ncarousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon the\\ndarkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship. She had swung\\nround to the ebb--her bow was now towards me--the only lights on board\\nwere in the cabin, and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of\\nthe strong rays that flowed from the stern window.\\n\\nThe ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade through a long belt\\nof swampy sand, where I sank several times above the ankle, before I\\ncame to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little way in,\\nwith some strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on the\\nsurface.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\nThe Ebb-tide Runs\\n\\nTHE coracle--as I had ample reason to know before I was done with\\nher--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both\\nbuoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained,\\nlop-sided craft to manage. Do as you pleased, she always made more\\nleeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre\\nshe was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was “queer\\nto handle till you knew her way.”\\n\\nCertainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction but the\\none I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on,\\nand I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the\\ntide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping\\nme down; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway, hardly to be\\nmissed.\\n\\nFirst she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than\\ndarkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the next\\nmoment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker grew the\\ncurrent of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold.\\n\\nThe hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong she\\npulled upon her anchor. All round the hull, in the blackness, the\\nrippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream.\\nOne cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down the\\ntide.\\n\\nSo far so good, but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut\\nhawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse. Ten to\\none, if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor, I\\nand the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water.\\n\\nThis brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not again\\nparticularly favoured me, I should have had to abandon my design. But\\nthe light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south\\nhad hauled round after nightfall into the south-west. Just while I was\\nmeditating, a puff came, caught the HISPANIOLA, and forced her up into\\nthe current; and to my great joy, I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp,\\nand the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water.\\n\\nWith that I made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with my teeth,\\nand cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung only by two.\\nThen I lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should be\\nonce more lightened by a breath of wind.\\n\\nAll this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin, but\\nto say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts\\nthat I had scarcely given ear. Now, however, when I had nothing else to\\ndo, I began to pay more heed.\\n\\nOne I recognized for the coxswain’s, Israel Hands, that had been Flint’s\\ngunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red\\nnight-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still\\ndrinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken\\ncry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to\\nbe an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they\\nwere furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and\\nthen there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end\\nin blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled\\nlower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed\\naway without result.\\n\\nOn shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly\\nthrough the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning\\nsailor’s song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse,\\nand seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I had\\nheard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words:\\n\\n     “But one man of her crew alive,\\n     What put to sea with seventy-five.”\\n\\nAnd I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a\\ncompany that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, from\\nwhat I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed\\non.\\n\\nAt last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the\\ndark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tough\\neffort, cut the last fibres through.\\n\\nThe breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was almost\\ninstantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA. At the same time,\\nthe schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end,\\nacross the current.\\n\\nI wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be swamped; and\\nsince I found I could not push the coracle directly off, I now shoved\\nstraight astern. At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, and\\njust as I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord\\nthat was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly I\\ngrasped it.\\n\\nWhy I should have done so I can hardly say. It was at first mere\\ninstinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast, curiosity\\nbegan to get the upper hand, and I determined I should have one look\\nthrough the cabin window.\\n\\nI pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself near\\nenough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded\\nthe roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin.\\n\\nBy this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty\\nswiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level with\\nthe camp-fire. The ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading\\nthe innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until I\\ngot my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmen\\nhad taken no alarm. One glance, however, was sufficient; and it was\\nonly one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff. It showed me\\nHands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a\\nhand upon the other’s throat.\\n\\nI dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for I was near\\noverboard. I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious,\\nencrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp, and I shut my\\neyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness.\\n\\nThe endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the whole diminished\\ncompany about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard so\\noften:\\n\\n          “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest--\\n              Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\\n           Drink and the devil had done for the rest--\\n              Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”\\n\\nI was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very\\nmoment in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, when I was surprised by a sudden\\nlurch of the coracle. At the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemed\\nto change her course. The speed in the meantime had strangely increased.\\n\\nI opened my eyes at once. All round me were little ripples, combing\\nover with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent. The\\nHISPANIOLA herself, a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirled\\nalong, seemed to stagger in her course, and I saw her spars toss a\\nlittle against the blackness of the night; nay, as I looked longer, I\\nmade sure she also was wheeling to the southward.\\n\\nI glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs. There,\\nright behind me, was the glow of the camp-fire. The current had turned\\nat right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and\\nthe little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever\\nmuttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea.\\n\\nSuddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw, turning,\\nperhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same moment one\\nshout followed another from on board; I could hear feet pounding on\\nthe companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards had at last been\\ninterrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster.\\n\\nI lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly\\nrecommended my spirit to its Maker. At the end of the straits, I\\nmade sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers, where all my\\ntroubles would be ended speedily; and though I could, perhaps, bear to\\ndie, I could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached.\\n\\nSo I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro upon the\\nbillows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing to\\nexpect death at the next plunge. Gradually weariness grew upon me; a\\nnumbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon my mind even in the midst of\\nmy terrors, until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle\\nI lay and dreamed of home and the old Admiral Benbow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nThe Cruise of the Coracle\\n\\nIT was broad day when I awoke and found myself tossing at the south-west\\nend of Treasure Island. The sun was up but was still hid from me behind\\nthe great bulk of the Spy-glass, which on this side descended almost to\\nthe sea in formidable cliffs.\\n\\nHaulbowline Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my elbow, the hill bare\\nand dark, the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and\\nfringed with great masses of fallen rock. I was scarce a quarter of a\\nmile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.\\n\\nThat notion was soon given over. Among the fallen rocks the breakers\\nspouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying and\\nfalling, succeeded one another from second to second; and I saw myself,\\nif I ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending\\nmy strength in vain to scale the beetling crags.\\n\\nNor was that all, for crawling together on flat tables of rock or\\nletting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld huge\\nslimy monsters--soft snails, as it were, of incredible bigness--two\\nor three score of them together, making the rocks to echo with their\\nbarkings.\\n\\nI have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely harmless.\\nBut the look of them, added to the difficulty of the shore and the\\nhigh running of the surf, was more than enough to disgust me of that\\nlanding-place. I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront\\nsuch perils.\\n\\nIn the meantime I had a better chance, as I supposed, before me. North\\nof Haulbowline Head, the land runs in a long way, leaving at low tide\\na long stretch of yellow sand. To the north of that, again, there comes\\nanother cape--Cape of the Woods, as it was marked upon the chart--buried\\nin tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea.\\n\\nI remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward\\nalong the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing from my\\nposition that I was already under its influence, I preferred to leave\\nHaulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to\\nland upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods.\\n\\nThere was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. The wind blowing steady\\nand gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between that and the\\ncurrent, and the billows rose and fell unbroken.\\n\\nHad it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished; but as it was,\\nit is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could\\nride. Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye\\nabove the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me;\\nyet the coracle would but bounce a little, dance as if on springs, and\\nsubside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird.\\n\\nI began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at\\npaddling. But even a small change in the disposition of the weight will\\nproduce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle. And I had hardly\\nmoved before the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement,\\nran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy, and\\nstruck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep into the side of the next\\nwave.\\n\\nI was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old\\nposition, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led\\nme as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she was not to be\\ninterfered with, and at that rate, since I could in no way influence her\\ncourse, what hope had I left of reaching land?\\n\\nI began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all that.\\nFirst, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the coracle with my\\nsea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, I set myself\\nto study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers.\\n\\nI found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks\\nfrom shore or from a vessel’s deck, was for all the world like any range\\nof hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. The\\ncoracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to\\nspeak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes\\nand higher, toppling summits of the wave.\\n\\n“Well, now,” thought I to myself, “it is plain I must lie where I am and\\nnot disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can put the paddle\\nover the side and from time to time, in smooth places, give her a shove\\nor two towards land.” No sooner thought upon than done. There I lay on\\nmy elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a\\nweak stroke or two to turn her head to shore.\\n\\nIt was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and as\\nwe drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infallibly\\nmiss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting. I was,\\nindeed, close in. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together\\nin the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without\\nfail.\\n\\nIt was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst. The glow\\nof the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the\\nsea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt,\\ncombined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the\\ntrees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the\\ncurrent had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea\\nopened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts.\\n\\nRight in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA\\nunder sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was\\nso distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad\\nor sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion,\\nsurprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing\\nbut stare and wonder.\\n\\nThe HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful\\nwhite canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I first\\nsighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about\\nnorth-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island\\non their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch more\\nand more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were\\ngoing about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind’s\\neye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her\\nsails shivering.\\n\\n“Clumsy fellows,” said I; “they must still be drunk as owls.” And I\\nthought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping.\\n\\nMeanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another\\ntack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead\\nin the wind’s eye. Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up and\\ndown, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops\\nand dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly\\nflapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And if\\nso, where were the men? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her,\\nI thought, and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel\\nto her captain.\\n\\nThe current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate.\\nAs for the latter’s sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she\\nhung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if\\nshe did not even lose. If only I dared to sit up and paddle, I made\\nsure that I could overhaul her. The scheme had an air of adventure\\nthat inspired me, and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore\\ncompanion doubled my growing courage.\\n\\nUp I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, but\\nthis time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength and\\ncaution, to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA. Once I shipped a sea\\nso heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like\\na bird, but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my\\ncoracle among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her bows and\\na dash of foam in my face.\\n\\nI was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; I could see the brass glisten\\non the tiller as it banged about, and still no soul appeared upon her\\ndecks. I could not choose but suppose she was deserted. If not, the men\\nwere lying drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps, and do\\nwhat I chose with the ship.\\n\\nFor some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for\\nme--standing still. She headed nearly due south, yawing, of course, all\\nthe time. Each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, and these\\nbrought her in a moment right to the wind again. I have said this was\\nthe worst thing possible for me, for helpless as she looked in this\\nsituation, with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling\\nand banging on the deck, she still continued to run away from me, not\\nonly with the speed of the current, but by the whole amount of her\\nleeway, which was naturally great.\\n\\nBut now, at last, I had my chance. The breeze fell for some seconds,\\nvery low, and the current gradually turning her, the HISPANIOLA revolved\\nslowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern, with the\\ncabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning\\non into the day. The main-sail hung drooped like a banner. She was\\nstock-still but for the current.\\n\\nFor the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling my\\nefforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase.\\n\\nI was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap;\\nshe filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimming\\nlike a swallow.\\n\\nMy first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy.\\nRound she came, till she was broadside on to me--round still till she\\nhad covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the\\ndistance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white under\\nher forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the\\ncoracle.\\n\\nAnd then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time to\\nthink--scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of one\\nswell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The bowsprit was\\nover my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under\\nwater. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged\\nbetween the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a\\ndull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the\\ncoracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\nI Strike the Jolly Roger\\n\\nI HAD scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib\\nflapped and filled upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. The\\nschooner trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the\\nother sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.\\n\\nThis had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now I lost no time,\\ncrawled back along the bowsprit, and tumbled head foremost on the deck.\\n\\nI was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the mainsail, which was\\nstill drawing, concealed from me a certain portion of the after-deck.\\nNot a soul was to be seen. The planks, which had not been swabbed since\\nthe mutiny, bore the print of many feet, and an empty bottle, broken by\\nthe neck, tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers.\\n\\nSuddenly the HISPANIOLA came right into the wind. The jibs behind me\\ncracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave a sickening\\nheave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard,\\nthe sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the lee after-deck.\\n\\nThere were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back, as stiff\\nas a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and\\nhis teeth showing through his open lips; Israel Hands propped against\\nthe bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his hands lying open before him on\\nthe deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow candle.\\n\\nFor a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, the\\nsails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the boom swinging to\\nand fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain. Now and again too\\nthere would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy\\nblow of the ship’s bows against the swell; so much heavier weather was\\nmade of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lop-sided\\ncoracle, now gone to the bottom of the sea.\\n\\nAt every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and fro, but--what was\\nghastly to behold--neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing\\ngrin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage. At every jump too, Hands\\nappeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the\\ndeck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole body canting\\ntowards the stern, so that his face became, little by little, hid\\nfrom me; and at last I could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed\\nringlet of one whisker.\\n\\nAt the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of dark\\nblood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each\\nother in their drunken wrath.\\n\\nWhile I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when the ship\\nwas still, Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed\\nhimself back to the position in which I had seen him first. The moan,\\nwhich told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which his jaw\\nhung open went right to my heart. But when I remembered the talk I had\\noverheard from the apple barrel, all pity left me.\\n\\nI walked aft until I reached the main-mast.\\n\\n“Come aboard, Mr. Hands,” I said ironically.\\n\\nHe rolled his eyes round heavily, but he was too far gone to express\\nsurprise. All he could do was to utter one word, “Brandy.”\\n\\nIt occurred to me there was no time to lose, and dodging the boom as it\\nonce more lurched across the deck, I slipped aft and down the companion\\nstairs into the cabin.\\n\\nIt was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. All the\\nlockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart. The floor\\nwas thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after\\nwading in the marshes round their camp. The bulkheads, all painted in\\nclear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands.\\nDozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of\\nthe ship. One of the doctor’s medical books lay open on the table, half\\nof the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for pipelights. In the midst of all\\nthis the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber.\\n\\nI went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles\\na most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly,\\nsince the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober.\\n\\nForaging about, I found a bottle with some brandy left, for Hands; and\\nfor myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch\\nof raisins, and a piece of cheese. With these I came on deck, put down\\nmy own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain’s\\nreach, went forward to the water-breaker, and had a good deep drink of\\nwater, and then, and not till then, gave Hands the brandy.\\n\\nHe must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth.\\n\\n“Aye,” said he, “by thunder, but I wanted some o’ that!”\\n\\nI had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat.\\n\\n“Much hurt?” I asked him.\\n\\nHe grunted, or rather, I might say, he barked.\\n\\n“If that doctor was aboard,” he said, “I’d be right enough in a couple\\nof turns, but I don’t have no manner of luck, you see, and that’s what’s\\nthe matter with me. As for that swab, he’s good and dead, he is,” he\\nadded, indicating the man with the red cap. “He warn’t no seaman anyhow.\\nAnd where mought you have come from?”\\n\\n“Well,” said I, “I’ve come aboard to take possession of this ship,\\nMr. Hands; and you’ll please regard me as your captain until further\\nnotice.”\\n\\nHe looked at me sourly enough but said nothing. Some of the colour had\\ncome back into his cheeks, though he still looked very sick and still\\ncontinued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about.\\n\\n“By the by,” I continued, “I can’t have these colours, Mr. Hands; and by\\nyour leave, I’ll strike ’em. Better none than these.”\\n\\nAnd again dodging the boom, I ran to the colour lines, handed down their\\ncursed black flag, and chucked it overboard.\\n\\n“God save the king!” said I, waving my cap. “And there’s an end to\\nCaptain Silver!”\\n\\nHe watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while on his breast.\\n\\n“I reckon,” he said at last, “I reckon, Cap’n Hawkins, you’ll kind of\\nwant to get ashore now. S’pose we talks.”\\n\\n“Why, yes,” says I, “with all my heart, Mr. Hands. Say on.” And I went\\nback to my meal with a good appetite.\\n\\n“This man,” he began, nodding feebly at the corpse “--O’Brien were his\\nname, a rank Irelander--this man and me got the canvas on her, meaning\\nfor to sail her back. Well, HE’S dead now, he is--as dead as bilge; and\\nwho’s to sail this ship, I don’t see. Without I gives you a hint, you\\nain’t that man, as far’s I can tell. Now, look here, you gives me food\\nand drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up, you do, and\\nI’ll tell you how to sail her, and that’s about square all round, I take\\nit.”\\n\\n“I’ll tell you one thing,” says I: “I’m not going back to Captain Kidd’s\\nanchorage. I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there.”\\n\\n“To be sure you did,” he cried. “Why, I ain’t sich an infernal lubber\\nafter all. I can see, can’t I? I’ve tried my fling, I have, and I’ve\\nlost, and it’s you has the wind of me. North Inlet? Why, I haven’t no\\nch’ice, not I! I’d help you sail her up to Execution Dock, by thunder!\\nSo I would.”\\n\\nWell, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. We struck our\\nbargain on the spot. In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing\\neasily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island, with good\\nhopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as\\nfar as North Inlet before high water, when we might beach her safely and\\nwait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land.\\n\\nThen I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest, where I got a\\nsoft silk handkerchief of my mother’s. With this, and with my aid, Hands\\nbound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh, and after\\nhe had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy, he\\nbegan to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder and clearer,\\nand looked in every way another man.\\n\\nThe breeze served us admirably. We skimmed before it like a bird, the\\ncoast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute.\\nSoon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low, sandy country,\\nsparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and soon we were beyond that again\\nand had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the\\nnorth.\\n\\nI was greatly elated with my new command, and pleased with the bright,\\nsunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast. I had now\\nplenty of water and good things to eat, and my conscience, which had\\nsmitten me hard for my desertion, was quieted by the great conquest I\\nhad made. I should, I think, have had nothing left me to desire but for\\nthe eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck\\nand the odd smile that appeared continually on his face. It was a smile\\nthat had in it something both of pain and weakness--a haggard old man’s\\nsmile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of\\ntreachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, and\\nwatched me at my work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\nIsrael Hands\\n\\nTHE wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west. We could run\\nso much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth\\nof the North Inlet. Only, as we had no power to anchor and dared not\\nbeach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our\\nhands. The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good many\\ntrials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal.\\n\\n“Cap’n,” said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile, “here’s\\nmy old shipmate, O’Brien; s’pose you was to heave him overboard. I ain’t\\npartic’lar as a rule, and I don’t take no blame for settling his hash,\\nbut I don’t reckon him ornamental now, do you?”\\n\\n“I’m not strong enough, and I don’t like the job; and there he lies, for\\nme,” said I.\\n\\n“This here’s an unlucky ship, this HISPANIOLA, Jim,” he went on,\\nblinking. “There’s a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA--a\\nsight o’ poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to\\nBristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this here\\nO’Brien now--he’s dead, ain’t he? Well now, I’m no scholar, and you’re a\\nlad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as a\\ndead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?”\\n\\n“You can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit; you must know\\nthat already,” I replied. “O’Brien there is in another world, and may be\\nwatching us.”\\n\\n“Ah!” says he. “Well, that’s unfort’nate--appears as if killing parties\\nwas a waste of time. Howsomever, sperrits don’t reckon for much, by what\\nI’ve seen. I’ll chance it with the sperrits, Jim. And now, you’ve spoke\\nup free, and I’ll take it kind if you’d step down into that there cabin\\nand get me a--well, a--shiver my timbers! I can’t hit the name on ’t;\\nwell, you get me a bottle of wine, Jim--this here brandy’s too strong\\nfor my head.”\\n\\nNow, the coxswain’s hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as for the\\nnotion of his preferring wine to brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. The\\nwhole story was a pretext. He wanted me to leave the deck--so much was\\nplain; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine. His eyes never\\nmet mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look\\nto the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead O’Brien. All the\\ntime he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty,\\nembarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent on\\nsome deception. I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where\\nmy advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily\\nconceal my suspicions to the end.\\n\\n“Some wine?” I said. “Far better. Will you have white or red?”\\n\\n“Well, I reckon it’s about the blessed same to me, shipmate,” he\\nreplied; “so it’s strong, and plenty of it, what’s the odds?”\\n\\n“All right,” I answered. “I’ll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But I’ll have\\nto dig for it.”\\n\\nWith that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could,\\nslipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the\\nforecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. I\\nknew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution\\npossible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true.\\n\\nHe had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his\\nleg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved--for I could hear\\nhim stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed\\nhimself across the deck. In half a minute he had reached the port\\nscuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a\\nshort dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked upon it for\\na moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand,\\nand then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled\\nback again into his old place against the bulwark.\\n\\nThis was all that I required to know. Israel could move about, he was\\nnow armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me,\\nit was plain that I was meant to be the victim. What he would do\\nafterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from\\nNorth Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long\\nTom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him--was,\\nof course, more than I could say.\\n\\nYet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in that\\nour interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition of\\nthe schooner. We both desired to have her stranded safe enough, in a\\nsheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off\\nagain with as little labour and danger as might be; and until that was\\ndone I considered that my life would certainly be spared.\\n\\nWhile I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not been\\nidle with my body. I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more\\ninto my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now,\\nwith this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck.\\n\\nHands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and with\\nhis eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light. He\\nlooked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle like\\na man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig, with his\\nfavourite toast of “Here’s luck!” Then he lay quiet for a little, and\\nthen, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid.\\n\\n“Cut me a junk o’ that,” says he, “for I haven’t no knife and hardly\\nstrength enough, so be as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I’ve missed\\nstays! Cut me a quid, as’ll likely be the last, lad, for I’m for my long\\nhome, and no mistake.”\\n\\n“Well,” said I, “I’ll cut you some tobacco, but if I was you and thought\\nmyself so badly, I would go to my prayers like a Christian man.”\\n\\n“Why?” said he. “Now, you tell me why.”\\n\\n“Why?” I cried. “You were asking me just now about the dead. You’ve\\nbroken your trust; you’ve lived in sin and lies and blood; there’s a man\\nyou killed lying at your feet this moment, and you ask me why! For God’s\\nmercy, Mr. Hands, that’s why.”\\n\\nI spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden\\nin his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with. He,\\nfor his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most\\nunusual solemnity.\\n\\n“For thirty years,” he said, “I’ve sailed the seas and seen good and\\nbad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out,\\nknives going, and what not. Well, now I tell you, I never seen good come\\no’ goodness yet. Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don’t bite;\\nthem’s my views--amen, so be it. And now, you look here,” he added,\\nsuddenly changing his tone, “we’ve had about enough of this foolery. The\\ntide’s made good enough by now. You just take my orders, Cap’n Hawkins,\\nand we’ll sail slap in and be done with it.”\\n\\nAll told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation was\\ndelicate, the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow\\nand shoal, but lay east and west, so that the schooner must be nicely\\nhandled to be got in. I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am\\nvery sure that Hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about\\nand dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that\\nwere a pleasure to behold.\\n\\nScarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us. The\\nshores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern\\nanchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what in\\ntruth it was, the estuary of a river. Right before us, at the southern\\nend, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation. It\\nhad been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to\\nthe injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of\\ndripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and\\nnow flourished thick with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed us\\nthat the anchorage was calm.\\n\\n“Now,” said Hands, “look there; there’s a pet bit for to beach a ship\\nin. Fine flat sand, never a cat’s paw, trees all around of it, and\\nflowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship.”\\n\\n“And once beached,” I inquired, “how shall we get her off again?”\\n\\n“Why, so,” he replied: “you take a line ashore there on the other side\\nat low water, take a turn about one of them big pines; bring it back,\\ntake a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the tide. Come high\\nwater, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet\\nas natur’. And now, boy, you stand by. We’re near the bit now, and she’s\\ntoo much way on her. Starboard a little--so--steady--starboard--larboard\\na little--steady--steady!”\\n\\nSo he issued his commands, which I breathlessly obeyed, till, all of a\\nsudden, he cried, “Now, my hearty, luff!” And I put the helm hard up,\\nand the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low,\\nwooded shore.\\n\\nThe excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the\\nwatch I had kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon the coxswain. Even then\\nI was still so much interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that I\\nhad quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over\\nthe starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before\\nthe bows. I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a\\nsudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head. Perhaps I\\nhad heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye;\\nperhaps it was an instinct like a cat’s; but, sure enough, when I looked\\nround, there was Hands, already half-way towards me, with the dirk in\\nhis right hand.\\n\\nWe must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while mine\\nwas the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of fury like a charging\\nbully’s. At the same instant, he threw himself forward and I leapt\\nsideways towards the bows. As I did so, I let go of the tiller, which\\nsprang sharp to leeward, and I think this saved my life, for it struck\\nHands across the chest and stopped him, for the moment, dead.\\n\\nBefore he could recover, I was safe out of the corner where he had me\\ntrapped, with all the deck to dodge about. Just forward of the main-mast\\nI stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket, took a cool aim, though he had\\nalready turned and was once more coming directly after me, and drew the\\ntrigger. The hammer fell, but there followed neither flash nor sound;\\nthe priming was useless with sea-water. I cursed myself for my neglect.\\nWhy had not I, long before, reprimed and reloaded my only weapons? Then\\nI should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher.\\n\\nWounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled\\nhair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign\\nwith his haste and fury. I had no time to try my other pistol, nor\\nindeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless. One thing I\\nsaw plainly: I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily\\nhold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed\\nme in the stern. Once so caught, and nine or ten inches of the\\nblood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity.\\nI placed my palms against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness,\\nand waited, every nerve upon the stretch.\\n\\nSeeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passed\\nin feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine. It was such\\na game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove,\\nbut never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart as\\nnow. Still, as I say, it was a boy’s game, and I thought I could hold\\nmy own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh. Indeed my\\ncourage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting\\nthoughts on what would be the end of the affair, and while I saw\\ncertainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no hope of any\\nultimate escape.\\n\\nWell, while things stood thus, suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck,\\nstaggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and then, swift as a\\nblow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle\\nof forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the\\nscupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark.\\n\\nWe were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almost\\ntogether, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still\\nspread out, tumbling stiffly after us. So near were we, indeed, that my\\nhead came against the coxswain’s foot with a crack that made my teeth\\nrattle. Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had got\\ninvolved with the dead body. The sudden canting of the ship had made the\\ndeck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape,\\nand that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. Quick as\\nthought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand,\\nand did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.\\n\\nI had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a foot\\nbelow me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel Hands\\nwith his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of\\nsurprise and disappointment.\\n\\nNow that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing the\\npriming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service, and to\\nmake assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw the load of the other\\nand recharge it afresh from the beginning.\\n\\nMy new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see the dice\\ngoing against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled\\nhimself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, began\\nslowly and painfully to mount. It cost him no end of time and groans\\nto haul his wounded leg behind him, and I had quietly finished my\\narrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up. Then,\\nwith a pistol in either hand, I addressed him.\\n\\n“One more step, Mr. Hands,” said I, “and I’ll blow your brains out! Dead\\nmen don’t bite, you know,” I added with a chuckle.\\n\\nHe stopped instantly. I could see by the working of his face that he was\\ntrying to think, and the process was so slow and laborious that, in my\\nnew-found security, I laughed aloud. At last, with a swallow or two, he\\nspoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity.\\nIn order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth, but in all\\nelse he remained unmoved.\\n\\n“Jim,” says he, “I reckon we’re fouled, you and me, and we’ll have to\\nsign articles. I’d have had you but for that there lurch, but I don’t\\nhave no luck, not I; and I reckon I’ll have to strike, which comes hard,\\nyou see, for a master mariner to a ship’s younker like you, Jim.”\\n\\nI was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited as a cock\\nupon a wall, when, all in a breath, back went his right hand over his\\nshoulder. Something sang like an arrow through the air; I felt a blow\\nand then a sharp pang, and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the\\nmast. In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment--I scarce can say\\nit was by my own volition, and I am sure it was without a conscious\\naim--both my pistols went off, and both escaped out of my hands. They\\ndid not fall alone; with a choked cry, the coxswain loosed his grasp\\nupon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n27\\n\\n“Pieces of Eight”\\n\\nOWING to the cant of the vessel, the masts hung far out over the water,\\nand from my perch on the cross-trees I had nothing below me but the\\nsurface of the bay. Hands, who was not so far up, was in consequence\\nnearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks. He rose once to\\nthe surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good.\\nAs the water settled, I could see him lying huddled together on the\\nclean, bright sand in the shadow of the vessel’s sides. A fish or two\\nwhipped past his body. Sometimes, by the quivering of the water, he\\nappeared to move a little, as if he were trying to rise. But he was dead\\nenough, for all that, being both shot and drowned, and was food for fish\\nin the very place where he had designed my slaughter.\\n\\nI was no sooner certain of this than I began to feel sick, faint, and\\nterrified. The hot blood was running over my back and chest. The dirk,\\nwhere it had pinned my shoulder to the mast, seemed to burn like a hot\\niron; yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me,\\nfor these, it seemed to me, I could bear without a murmur; it was the\\nhorror I had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees into that\\nstill green water, beside the body of the coxswain.\\n\\nI clung with both hands till my nails ached, and I shut my eyes as if to\\ncover up the peril. Gradually my mind came back again, my pulses quieted\\ndown to a more natural time, and I was once more in possession of\\nmyself.\\n\\nIt was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk, but either it stuck too\\nhard or my nerve failed me, and I desisted with a violent shudder. Oddly\\nenough, that very shudder did the business. The knife, in fact, had come\\nthe nearest in the world to missing me altogether; it held me by a mere\\npinch of skin, and this the shudder tore away. The blood ran down the\\nfaster, to be sure, but I was my own master again and only tacked to the\\nmast by my coat and shirt.\\n\\nThese last I broke through with a sudden jerk, and then regained the\\ndeck by the starboard shrouds. For nothing in the world would I have\\nagain ventured, shaken as I was, upon the overhanging port shrouds from\\nwhich Israel had so lately fallen.\\n\\nI went below and did what I could for my wound; it pained me a good deal\\nand still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor dangerous, nor did it\\ngreatly gall me when I used my arm. Then I looked around me, and as the\\nship was now, in a sense, my own, I began to think of clearing it from\\nits last passenger--the dead man, O’Brien.\\n\\nHe had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks, where he lay\\nlike some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed, but how\\ndifferent from life’s colour or life’s comeliness! In that position\\nI could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of tragical\\nadventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead, I took him\\nby the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave,\\ntumbled him overboard. He went in with a sounding plunge; the red cap\\ncame off and remained floating on the surface; and as soon as the splash\\nsubsided, I could see him and Israel lying side by side, both wavering\\nwith the tremulous movement of the water. O’Brien, though still quite a\\nyoung man, was very bald. There he lay, with that bald head across the\\nknees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and\\nfro over both.\\n\\nI was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned. The sun was\\nwithin so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines\\nupon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and\\nfall in patterns on the deck. The evening breeze had sprung up, and\\nthough it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the\\neast, the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the\\nidle sails to rattle to and fro.\\n\\nI began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily doused and\\nbrought tumbling to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder matter. Of\\ncourse, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and\\nthe cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. I thought\\nthis made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that I\\nhalf feared to meddle. At last I got my knife and cut the halyards. The\\npeak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon\\nthe water, and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the downhall,\\nthat was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the rest, the\\nHISPANIOLA must trust to luck, like myself.\\n\\nBy this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow--the last rays,\\nI remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as\\njewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck. It began to be chill; the\\ntide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling more and more\\non her beam-ends.\\n\\nI scrambled forward and looked over. It seemed shallow enough, and\\nholding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, I let myself\\ndrop softly overboard. The water scarcely reached my waist; the sand was\\nfirm and covered with ripple marks, and I waded ashore in great spirits,\\nleaving the HISPANIOLA on her side, with her main-sail trailing wide\\nupon the surface of the bay. About the same time, the sun went fairly\\ndown and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines.\\n\\nAt least, and at last, I was off the sea, nor had I returned thence\\nempty-handed. There lay the schooner, clear at last from buccaneers\\nand ready for our own men to board and get to sea again. I had nothing\\nnearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my\\nachievements. Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but the\\nrecapture of the HISPANIOLA was a clenching answer, and I hoped that\\neven Captain Smollett would confess I had not lost my time.\\n\\nSo thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my face homeward for\\nthe block house and my companions. I remembered that the most easterly\\nof the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd’s anchorage ran from the\\ntwo-peaked hill upon my left, and I bent my course in that direction\\nthat I might pass the stream while it was small. The wood was pretty\\nopen, and keeping along the lower spurs, I had soon turned the corner\\nof that hill, and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the\\nwatercourse.\\n\\nThis brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn, the maroon;\\nand I walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every side. The dusk\\nhad come nigh hand completely, and as I opened out the cleft between the\\ntwo peaks, I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where, as\\nI judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring\\nfire. And yet I wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself so\\ncareless. For if I could see this radiance, might it not reach the eyes\\nof Silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes?\\n\\nGradually the night fell blacker; it was all I could do to guide myself\\neven roughly towards my destination; the double hill behind me and the\\nSpy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter; the stars were few\\nand pale; and in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping among\\nbushes and rolling into sandy pits.\\n\\nSuddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. I looked up; a pale glimmer\\nof moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass, and soon after\\nI saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees, and\\nknew the moon had risen.\\n\\nWith this to help me, I passed rapidly over what remained to me of my\\njourney, and sometimes walking, sometimes running, impatiently drew near\\nto the stockade. Yet, as I began to thread the grove that lies before\\nit, I was not so thoughtless but that I slacked my pace and went a\\ntrifle warily. It would have been a poor end of my adventures to get\\nshot down by my own party in mistake.\\n\\nThe moon was climbing higher and higher, its light began to fall here\\nand there in masses through the more open districts of the wood, and\\nright in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among\\nthe trees. It was red and hot, and now and again it was a little\\ndarkened--as it were, the embers of a bonfire smouldering.\\n\\nFor the life of me I could not think what it might be.\\n\\nAt last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing. The western\\nend was already steeped in moonshine; the rest, and the block house\\nitself, still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks\\nof light. On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned\\nitself into clear embers and shed a steady, red reverberation,\\ncontrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon. There was not\\na soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze.\\n\\nI stopped, with much wonder in my heart, and perhaps a little terror\\nalso. It had not been our way to build great fires; we were, indeed,\\nby the captain’s orders, somewhat niggardly of firewood, and I began to\\nfear that something had gone wrong while I was absent.\\n\\nI stole round by the eastern end, keeping close in shadow, and at a\\nconvenient place, where the darkness was thickest, crossed the palisade.\\n\\nTo make assurance surer, I got upon my hands and knees and crawled,\\nwithout a sound, towards the corner of the house. As I drew nearer, my\\nheart was suddenly and greatly lightened. It is not a pleasant noise in\\nitself, and I have often complained of it at other times, but just\\nthen it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and\\npeaceful in their sleep. The sea-cry of the watch, that beautiful “All’s\\nwell,” never fell more reassuringly on my ear.\\n\\nIn the meantime, there was no doubt of one thing; they kept an infamous\\nbad watch. If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping\\nin on them, not a soul would have seen daybreak. That was what it\\nwas, thought I, to have the captain wounded; and again I blamed myself\\nsharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard.\\n\\nBy this time I had got to the door and stood up. All was dark within,\\nso that I could distinguish nothing by the eye. As for sounds, there\\nwas the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise, a\\nflickering or pecking that I could in no way account for.\\n\\nWith my arms before me I walked steadily in. I should lie down in my own\\nplace (I thought with a silent chuckle) and enjoy their faces when they\\nfound me in the morning.\\n\\nMy foot struck something yielding--it was a sleeper’s leg; and he turned\\nand groaned, but without awaking.\\n\\nAnd then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the\\ndarkness:\\n\\n“Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\\nPieces of eight!” and so forth, without pause or change, like the\\nclacking of a tiny mill.\\n\\nSilver’s green parrot, Captain Flint! It was she whom I had heard\\npecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch than any\\nhuman being, who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain.\\n\\nI had no time left me to recover. At the sharp, clipping tone of the\\nparrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty oath, the\\nvoice of Silver cried, “Who goes?”\\n\\nI turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran\\nfull into the arms of a second, who for his part closed upon and held me\\ntight.\\n\\n“Bring a torch, Dick,” said Silver when my capture was thus assured.\\n\\nAnd one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a\\nlighted brand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART SIX--Captain Silver\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n28\\n\\nIn the Enemy’s Camp\\n\\nTHE red glare of the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house,\\nshowed me the worst of my apprehensions realized. The pirates were in\\npossession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac,\\nthere were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold increased\\nmy horror, not a sign of any prisoner. I could only judge that all had\\nperished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had not been there to\\nperish with them.\\n\\nThere were six of the buccaneers, all told; not another man was left\\nalive. Five of them were on their feet, flushed and swollen, suddenly\\ncalled out of the first sleep of drunkenness. The sixth had only risen\\nupon his elbow; he was deadly pale, and the blood-stained bandage round\\nhis head told that he had recently been wounded, and still more recently\\ndressed. I remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among\\nthe woods in the great attack, and doubted not that this was he.\\n\\nThe parrot sat, preening her plumage, on Long John’s shoulder. He\\nhimself, I thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than I was used\\nto. He still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his\\nmission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear, daubed with clay and\\ntorn with the sharp briers of the wood.\\n\\n“So,” said he, “here’s Jim Hawkins, shiver my timbers! Dropped in, like,\\neh? Well, come, I take that friendly.”\\n\\nAnd thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a\\npipe.\\n\\n“Give me a loan of the link, Dick,” said he; and then, when he had a\\ngood light, “That’ll do, lad,” he added; “stick the glim in the wood\\nheap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to! You needn’t stand up\\nfor Mr. Hawkins; HE’LL excuse you, you may lay to that. And so,\\nJim”--stopping the tobacco--“here you were, and quite a pleasant\\nsurprise for poor old John. I see you were smart when first I set my\\neyes on you, but this here gets away from me clean, it do.”\\n\\nTo all this, as may be well supposed, I made no answer. They had set me\\nwith my back against the wall, and I stood there, looking Silver in the\\nface, pluckily enough, I hope, to all outward appearance, but with black\\ndespair in my heart.\\n\\nSilver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran\\non again.\\n\\n“Now, you see, Jim, so be as you ARE here,” says he, “I’ll give you a\\npiece of my mind. I’ve always liked you, I have, for a lad of spirit,\\nand the picter of my own self when I was young and handsome. I always\\nwanted you to jine and take your share, and die a gentleman, and now, my\\ncock, you’ve got to. Cap’n Smollett’s a fine seaman, as I’ll own up to\\nany day, but stiff on discipline. ‘Dooty is dooty,’ says he, and right\\nhe is. Just you keep clear of the cap’n. The doctor himself is gone dead\\nagain you--‘ungrateful scamp’ was what he said; and the short and the\\nlong of the whole story is about here: you can’t go back to your own\\nlot, for they won’t have you; and without you start a third ship’s\\ncompany all by yourself, which might be lonely, you’ll have to jine with\\nCap’n Silver.”\\n\\nSo far so good. My friends, then, were still alive, and though I partly\\nbelieved the truth of Silver’s statement, that the cabin party were\\nincensed at me for my desertion, I was more relieved than distressed by\\nwhat I heard.\\n\\n“I don’t say nothing as to your being in our hands,” continued Silver,\\n“though there you are, and you may lay to it. I’m all for argyment; I\\nnever seen good come out o’ threatening. If you like the service, well,\\nyou’ll jine; and if you don’t, Jim, why, you’re free to answer no--free\\nand welcome, shipmate; and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman,\\nshiver my sides!”\\n\\n“Am I to answer, then?” I asked with a very tremulous voice. Through all\\nthis sneering talk, I was made to feel the threat of death that overhung\\nme, and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast.\\n\\n“Lad,” said Silver, “no one’s a-pressing of you. Take your bearings.\\nNone of us won’t hurry you, mate; time goes so pleasant in your company,\\nyou see.”\\n\\n“Well,” says I, growing a bit bolder, “if I’m to choose, I declare I\\nhave a right to know what’s what, and why you’re here, and where my\\nfriends are.”\\n\\n“Wot’s wot?” repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl. “Ah, he’d\\nbe a lucky one as knowed that!”\\n\\n“You’ll perhaps batten down your hatches till you’re spoke to, my\\nfriend,” cried Silver truculently to this speaker. And then, in\\nhis first gracious tones, he replied to me, “Yesterday morning, Mr.\\nHawkins,” said he, “in the dog-watch, down came Doctor Livesey with a\\nflag of truce. Says he, ‘Cap’n Silver, you’re sold out. Ship’s gone.’\\nWell, maybe we’d been taking a glass, and a song to help it round. I\\nwon’t say no. Leastways, none of us had looked out. We looked out, and\\nby thunder, the old ship was gone! I never seen a pack o’ fools look\\nfishier; and you may lay to that, if I tells you that looked the\\nfishiest. ‘Well,’ says the doctor, ‘let’s bargain.’ We bargained, him\\nand I, and here we are: stores, brandy, block house, the firewood you\\nwas thoughtful enough to cut, and in a manner of speaking, the whole\\nblessed boat, from cross-trees to kelson. As for them, they’ve tramped;\\nI don’t know where’s they are.”\\n\\nHe drew again quietly at his pipe.\\n\\n“And lest you should take it into that head of yours,” he went on, “that\\nyou was included in the treaty, here’s the last word that was said: ‘How\\nmany are you,’ says I, ‘to leave?’ ‘Four,’ says he; ‘four, and one of us\\nwounded. As for that boy, I don’t know where he is, confound him,’ says\\nhe, ‘nor I don’t much care. We’re about sick of him.’ These was his\\nwords.\\n\\n“Is that all?” I asked.\\n\\n“Well, it’s all that you’re to hear, my son,” returned Silver.\\n\\n“And now I am to choose?”\\n\\n“And now you are to choose, and you may lay to that,” said Silver.\\n\\n“Well,” said I, “I am not such a fool but I know pretty well what I have\\nto look for. Let the worst come to the worst, it’s little I care. I’ve\\nseen too many die since I fell in with you. But there’s a thing or two\\nI have to tell you,” I said, and by this time I was quite excited; “and\\nthe first is this: here you are, in a bad way--ship lost, treasure lost,\\nmen lost, your whole business gone to wreck; and if you want to know who\\ndid it--it was I! I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land,\\nand I heard you, John, and you, Dick Johnson, and Hands, who is now at\\nthe bottom of the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was\\nout. And as for the schooner, it was I who cut her cable, and it was I\\nthat killed the men you had aboard of her, and it was I who brought her\\nwhere you’ll never see her more, not one of you. The laugh’s on my side;\\nI’ve had the top of this business from the first; I no more fear you\\nthan I fear a fly. Kill me, if you please, or spare me. But one thing\\nI’ll say, and no more; if you spare me, bygones are bygones, and when\\nyou fellows are in court for piracy, I’ll save you all I can. It is for\\nyou to choose. Kill another and do yourselves no good, or spare me and\\nkeep a witness to save you from the gallows.”\\n\\nI stopped, for, I tell you, I was out of breath, and to my wonder, not\\na man of them moved, but all sat staring at me like as many sheep. And\\nwhile they were still staring, I broke out again, “And now, Mr. Silver,”\\n I said, “I believe you’re the best man here, and if things go to the\\nworst, I’ll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way I took\\nit.”\\n\\n“I’ll bear it in mind,” said Silver with an accent so curious that I\\ncould not, for the life of me, decide whether he were laughing at my\\nrequest or had been favourably affected by my courage.\\n\\n“I’ll put one to that,” cried the old mahogany-faced seaman--Morgan\\nby name--whom I had seen in Long John’s public-house upon the quays of\\nBristol. “It was him that knowed Black Dog.”\\n\\n“Well, and see here,” added the sea-cook. “I’ll put another again to\\nthat, by thunder! For it was this same boy that faked the chart from\\nBilly Bones. First and last, we’ve split upon Jim Hawkins!”\\n\\n“Then here goes!” said Morgan with an oath.\\n\\nAnd he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty.\\n\\n“Avast, there!” cried Silver. “Who are you, Tom Morgan? Maybe you\\nthought you was cap’n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I’ll teach you\\nbetter! Cross me, and you’ll go where many a good man’s gone before you,\\nfirst and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver\\nmy timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. There’s\\nnever a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a’terwards,\\nTom Morgan, you may lay to that.”\\n\\nMorgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others.\\n\\n“Tom’s right,” said one.\\n\\n“I stood hazing long enough from one,” added another. “I’ll be hanged if\\nI’ll be hazed by you, John Silver.”\\n\\n“Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?” roared Silver,\\nbending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still\\nglowing in his right hand. “Put a name on what you’re at; you ain’t\\ndumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many\\nyears, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the\\nlatter end of it? You know the way; you’re all gentlemen o’ fortune, by\\nyour account. Well, I’m ready. Take a cutlass, him that dares, and I’ll\\nsee the colour of his inside, crutch and all, before that pipe’s empty.”\\n\\nNot a man stirred; not a man answered.\\n\\n“That’s your sort, is it?” he added, returning his pipe to his mouth.\\n“Well, you’re a gay lot to look at, anyway. Not much worth to fight, you\\nain’t. P’r’aps you can understand King George’s English. I’m cap’n here\\nby ’lection. I’m cap’n here because I’m the best man by a long sea-mile.\\nYou won’t fight, as gentlemen o’ fortune should; then, by thunder,\\nyou’ll obey, and you may lay to it! I like that boy, now; I never seen\\na better boy than that. He’s more a man than any pair of rats of you in\\nthis here house, and what I say is this: let me see him that’ll lay a\\nhand on him--that’s what I say, and you may lay to it.”\\n\\nThere was a long pause after this. I stood straight up against the wall,\\nmy heart still going like a sledge-hammer, but with a ray of hope\\nnow shining in my bosom. Silver leant back against the wall, his arms\\ncrossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, as calm as though he had\\nbeen in church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept the\\ntail of it on his unruly followers. They, on their part, drew gradually\\ntogether towards the far end of the block house, and the low hiss of\\ntheir whispering sounded in my ear continuously, like a stream. One\\nafter another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would\\nfall for a second on their nervous faces; but it was not towards me, it\\nwas towards Silver that they turned their eyes.\\n\\n“You seem to have a lot to say,” remarked Silver, spitting far into the\\nair. “Pipe up and let me hear it, or lay to.”\\n\\n“Ax your pardon, sir,” returned one of the men; “you’re pretty free with\\nsome of the rules; maybe you’ll kindly keep an eye upon the rest. This\\ncrew’s dissatisfied; this crew don’t vally bullying a marlin-spike; this\\ncrew has its rights like other crews, I’ll make so free as that; and by\\nyour own rules, I take it we can talk together. I ax your pardon, sir,\\nacknowledging you for to be captaing at this present; but I claim my\\nright, and steps outside for a council.”\\n\\nAnd with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking,\\nyellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and\\ndisappeared out of the house. One after another the rest followed his\\nexample, each making a salute as he passed, each adding some apology.\\n“According to rules,” said one. “Forecastle council,” said Morgan. And\\nso with one remark or another all marched out and left Silver and me\\nalone with the torch.\\n\\nThe sea-cook instantly removed his pipe.\\n\\n“Now, look you here, Jim Hawkins,” he said in a steady whisper that was\\nno more than audible, “you’re within half a plank of death, and what’s\\na long sight worse, of torture. They’re going to throw me off. But, you\\nmark, I stand by you through thick and thin. I didn’t mean to; no, not\\ntill you spoke up. I was about desperate to lose that much blunt, and\\nbe hanged into the bargain. But I see you was the right sort. I says to\\nmyself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins’ll stand by you. You’re\\nhis last card, and by the living thunder, John, he’s yours! Back to\\nback, says I. You save your witness, and he’ll save your neck!”\\n\\nI began dimly to understand.\\n\\n“You mean all’s lost?” I asked.\\n\\n“Aye, by gum, I do!” he answered. “Ship gone, neck gone--that’s the\\nsize of it. Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen no\\nschooner--well, I’m tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and their\\ncouncil, mark me, they’re outright fools and cowards. I’ll save your\\nlife--if so be as I can--from them. But, see here, Jim--tit for tat--you\\nsave Long John from swinging.”\\n\\nI was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking--he, the\\nold buccaneer, the ringleader throughout.\\n\\n“What I can do, that I’ll do,” I said.\\n\\n“It’s a bargain!” cried Long John. “You speak up plucky, and by thunder,\\nI’ve a chance!”\\n\\nHe hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among the firewood, and\\ntook a fresh light to his pipe.\\n\\n“Understand me, Jim,” he said, returning. “I’ve a head on my shoulders,\\nI have. I’m on squire’s side now. I know you’ve got that ship safe\\nsomewheres. How you done it, I don’t know, but safe it is. I guess Hands\\nand O’Brien turned soft. I never much believed in neither of THEM. Now\\nyou mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won’t let others. I know when\\na game’s up, I do; and I know a lad that’s staunch. Ah, you that’s\\nyoung--you and me might have done a power of good together!”\\n\\nHe drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin.\\n\\n“Will you taste, messmate?” he asked; and when I had refused: “Well,\\nI’ll take a dram myself, Jim,” said he. “I need a caulker, for there’s\\ntrouble on hand. And talking o’ trouble, why did that doctor give me the\\nchart, Jim?”\\n\\nMy face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of\\nfurther questions.\\n\\n“Ah, well, he did, though,” said he. “And there’s something under that,\\nno doubt--something, surely, under that, Jim--bad or good.”\\n\\nAnd he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his great fair head\\nlike a man who looks forward to the worst.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\nThe Black Spot Again\\n\\nTHE council of buccaneers had lasted some time, when one of them\\nre-entered the house, and with a repetition of the same salute, which\\nhad in my eyes an ironical air, begged for a moment’s loan of the torch.\\nSilver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us\\ntogether in the dark.\\n\\n“There’s a breeze coming, Jim,” said Silver, who had by this time\\nadopted quite a friendly and familiar tone.\\n\\nI turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out. The embers of the\\ngreat fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and\\nduskily that I understood why these conspirators desired a torch. About\\nhalf-way down the slope to the stockade, they were collected in a group;\\none held the light, another was on his knees in their midst, and I saw\\nthe blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in\\nthe moon and torchlight. The rest were all somewhat stooping, as though\\nwatching the manoeuvres of this last. I could just make out that he\\nhad a book as well as a knife in his hand, and was still wondering how\\nanything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling\\nfigure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move\\ntogether towards the house.\\n\\n“Here they come,” said I; and I returned to my former position, for it\\nseemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them.\\n\\n“Well, let ’em come, lad--let ’em come,” said Silver cheerily. “I’ve\\nstill a shot in my locker.”\\n\\nThe door opened, and the five men, standing huddled together just\\ninside, pushed one of their number forward. In any other circumstances\\nit would have been comical to see his slow advance, hesitating as he set\\ndown each foot, but holding his closed right hand in front of him.\\n\\n“Step up, lad,” cried Silver. “I won’t eat you. Hand it over, lubber. I\\nknow the rules, I do; I won’t hurt a depytation.”\\n\\nThus encouraged, the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly, and having\\npassed something to Silver, from hand to hand, slipped yet more smartly\\nback again to his companions.\\n\\nThe sea-cook looked at what had been given him.\\n\\n“The black spot! I thought so,” he observed. “Where might you have got\\nthe paper? Why, hillo! Look here, now; this ain’t lucky! You’ve gone and\\ncut this out of a Bible. What fool’s cut a Bible?”\\n\\n“Ah, there!” said Morgan. “There! Wot did I say? No good’ll come o’\\nthat, I said.”\\n\\n“Well, you’ve about fixed it now, among you,” continued Silver. “You’ll\\nall swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?”\\n\\n“It was Dick,” said one.\\n\\n“Dick, was it? Then Dick can get to prayers,” said Silver. “He’s seen\\nhis slice of luck, has Dick, and you may lay to that.”\\n\\nBut here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in.\\n\\n“Belay that talk, John Silver,” he said. “This crew has tipped you the\\nblack spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you turn it over, as\\nin dooty bound, and see what’s wrote there. Then you can talk.”\\n\\n“Thanky, George,” replied the sea-cook. “You always was brisk for\\nbusiness, and has the rules by heart, George, as I’m pleased to see.\\nWell, what is it, anyway? Ah! ‘Deposed’--that’s it, is it? Very pretty\\nwrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o’ write, George? Why,\\nyou was gettin’ quite a leadin’ man in this here crew. You’ll be cap’n\\nnext, I shouldn’t wonder. Just oblige me with that torch again, will\\nyou? This pipe don’t draw.”\\n\\n“Come, now,” said George, “you don’t fool this crew no more. You’re a\\nfunny man, by your account; but you’re over now, and you’ll maybe step\\ndown off that barrel and help vote.”\\n\\n“I thought you said you knowed the rules,” returned Silver\\ncontemptuously. “Leastways, if you don’t, I do; and I wait here--and I’m\\nstill your cap’n, mind--till you outs with your grievances and I reply;\\nin the meantime, your black spot ain’t worth a biscuit. After that,\\nwe’ll see.”\\n\\n“Oh,” replied George, “you don’t be under no kind of apprehension; WE’RE\\nall square, we are. First, you’ve made a hash of this cruise--you’ll be\\na bold man to say no to that. Second, you let the enemy out o’ this here\\ntrap for nothing. Why did they want out? I dunno, but it’s pretty plain\\nthey wanted it. Third, you wouldn’t let us go at them upon the march.\\nOh, we see through you, John Silver; you want to play booty, that’s\\nwhat’s wrong with you. And then, fourth, there’s this here boy.”\\n\\n“Is that all?” asked Silver quietly.\\n\\n“Enough, too,” retorted George. “We’ll all swing and sun-dry for your\\nbungling.”\\n\\n“Well now, look here, I’ll answer these four p’ints; one after another\\nI’ll answer ’em. I made a hash o’ this cruise, did I? Well now, you all\\nknow what I wanted, and you all know if that had been done that we’d\\n’a been aboard the HISPANIOLA this night as ever was, every man of us\\nalive, and fit, and full of good plum-duff, and the treasure in the hold\\nof her, by thunder! Well, who crossed me? Who forced my hand, as was the\\nlawful cap’n? Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began\\nthis dance? Ah, it’s a fine dance--I’m with you there--and looks mighty\\nlike a hornpipe in a rope’s end at Execution Dock by London town, it\\ndoes. But who done it? Why, it was Anderson, and Hands, and you, George\\nMerry! And you’re the last above board of that same meddling crew;\\nand you have the Davy Jones’s insolence to up and stand for cap’n over\\nme--you, that sank the lot of us! By the powers! But this tops the\\nstiffest yarn to nothing.”\\n\\nSilver paused, and I could see by the faces of George and his late\\ncomrades that these words had not been said in vain.\\n\\n“That’s for number one,” cried the accused, wiping the sweat from his\\nbrow, for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house.\\n“Why, I give you my word, I’m sick to speak to you. You’ve neither sense\\nnor memory, and I leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you\\ncome to sea. Sea! Gentlemen o’ fortune! I reckon tailors is your trade.”\\n\\n“Go on, John,” said Morgan. “Speak up to the others.”\\n\\n“Ah, the others!” returned John. “They’re a nice lot, ain’t they? You\\nsay this cruise is bungled. Ah! By gum, if you could understand how bad\\nit’s bungled, you would see! We’re that near the gibbet that my neck’s\\nstiff with thinking on it. You’ve seen ’em, maybe, hanged in chains,\\nbirds about ’em, seamen p’inting ’em out as they go down with the tide.\\n‘Who’s that?’ says one. ‘That! Why, that’s John Silver. I knowed him\\nwell,’ says another. And you can hear the chains a-jangle as you go\\nabout and reach for the other buoy. Now, that’s about where we are,\\nevery mother’s son of us, thanks to him, and Hands, and Anderson, and\\nother ruination fools of you. And if you want to know about number four,\\nand that boy, why, shiver my timbers, isn’t he a hostage? Are we a-going\\nto waste a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I\\nshouldn’t wonder. Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah,\\nwell, there’s a deal to say to number three. Maybe you don’t count it\\nnothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day--you, John,\\nwith your head broke--or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes\\nupon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel\\nto this same moment on the clock? And maybe, perhaps, you didn’t know\\nthere was a consort coming either? But there is, and not so long till\\nthen; and we’ll see who’ll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to\\nthat. And as for number two, and why I made a bargain--well, you came\\ncrawling on your knees to me to make it--on your knees you came, you was\\nthat downhearted--and you’d have starved too if I hadn’t--but that’s a\\ntrifle! You look there--that’s why!”\\n\\nAnd he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly\\nrecognized--none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the three\\nred crosses, that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the\\ncaptain’s chest. Why the doctor had given it to him was more than I\\ncould fancy.\\n\\nBut if it were inexplicable to me, the appearance of the chart was\\nincredible to the surviving mutineers. They leaped upon it like cats\\nupon a mouse. It went from hand to hand, one tearing it from another;\\nand by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they\\naccompanied their examination, you would have thought, not only they\\nwere fingering the very gold, but were at sea with it, besides, in\\nsafety.\\n\\n“Yes,” said one, “that’s Flint, sure enough. J. F., and a score below,\\nwith a clove hitch to it; so he done ever.”\\n\\n“Mighty pretty,” said George. “But how are we to get away with it, and\\nus no ship.”\\n\\nSilver suddenly sprang up, and supporting himself with a hand against\\nthe wall: “Now I give you warning, George,” he cried. “One more word\\nof your sauce, and I’ll call you down and fight you. How? Why, how do I\\nknow? You had ought to tell me that--you and the rest, that lost me my\\nschooner, with your interference, burn you! But not you, you can’t; you\\nhain’t got the invention of a cockroach. But civil you can speak, and\\nshall, George Merry, you may lay to that.”\\n\\n“That’s fair enow,” said the old man Morgan.\\n\\n“Fair! I reckon so,” said the sea-cook. “You lost the ship; I found the\\ntreasure. Who’s the better man at that? And now I resign, by thunder!\\nElect whom you please to be your cap’n now; I’m done with it.”\\n\\n“Silver!” they cried. “Barbecue forever! Barbecue for cap’n!”\\n\\n“So that’s the toon, is it?” cried the cook. “George, I reckon you’ll\\nhave to wait another turn, friend; and lucky for you as I’m not a\\nrevengeful man. But that was never my way. And now, shipmates, this\\nblack spot? ’Tain’t much good now, is it? Dick’s crossed his luck and\\nspoiled his Bible, and that’s about all.”\\n\\n“It’ll do to kiss the book on still, won’t it?” growled Dick, who was\\nevidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself.\\n\\n“A Bible with a bit cut out!” returned Silver derisively. “Not it. It\\ndon’t bind no more’n a ballad-book.”\\n\\n“Don’t it, though?” cried Dick with a sort of joy. “Well, I reckon\\nthat’s worth having too.”\\n\\n“Here, Jim--here’s a cur’osity for you,” said Silver, and he tossed me\\nthe paper.\\n\\nIt was around about the size of a crown piece. One side was blank,\\nfor it had been the last leaf; the other contained a verse or two of\\nRevelation--these words among the rest, which struck sharply home upon\\nmy mind: “Without are dogs and murderers.” The printed side had been\\nblackened with wood ash, which already began to come off and soil my\\nfingers; on the blank side had been written with the same material the\\none word “Depposed.” I have that curiosity beside me at this moment, but\\nnot a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch, such as a\\nman might make with his thumb-nail.\\n\\nThat was the end of the night’s business. Soon after, with a drink all\\nround, we lay down to sleep, and the outside of Silver’s vengeance was\\nto put George Merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he\\nshould prove unfaithful.\\n\\nIt was long ere I could close an eye, and heaven knows I had matter\\nenough for thought in the man whom I had slain that afternoon, in my own\\nmost perilous position, and above all, in the remarkable game that I saw\\nSilver now engaged upon--keeping the mutineers together with one hand\\nand grasping with the other after every means, possible and impossible,\\nto make his peace and save his miserable life. He himself slept\\npeacefully and snored aloud, yet my heart was sore for him, wicked as he\\nwas, to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet\\nthat awaited him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30\\n\\nOn Parole\\n\\nI WAS wakened--indeed, we were all wakened, for I could see even the\\nsentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against the\\ndoor-post--by a clear, hearty voice hailing us from the margin of the\\nwood:\\n\\n“Block house, ahoy!” it cried. “Here’s the doctor.”\\n\\nAnd the doctor it was. Although I was glad to hear the sound, yet my\\ngladness was not without admixture. I remembered with confusion my\\ninsubordinate and stealthy conduct, and when I saw where it had brought\\nme--among what companions and surrounded by what dangers--I felt ashamed\\nto look him in the face.\\n\\nHe must have risen in the dark, for the day had hardly come; and when I\\nran to a loophole and looked out, I saw him standing, like Silver once\\nbefore, up to the mid-leg in creeping vapour.\\n\\n“You, doctor! Top o’ the morning to you, sir!” cried Silver, broad awake\\nand beaming with good nature in a moment. “Bright and early, to be sure;\\nand it’s the early bird, as the saying goes, that gets the rations.\\nGeorge, shake up your timbers, son, and help Dr. Livesey over the ship’s\\nside. All a-doin’ well, your patients was--all well and merry.”\\n\\nSo he pattered on, standing on the hilltop with his crutch under his\\nelbow and one hand upon the side of the log-house--quite the old John in\\nvoice, manner, and expression.\\n\\n“We’ve quite a surprise for you too, sir,” he continued. “We’ve a little\\nstranger here--he! he! A noo boarder and lodger, sir, and looking fit\\nand taut as a fiddle; slep’ like a supercargo, he did, right alongside\\nof John--stem to stem we was, all night.”\\n\\nDr. Livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the\\ncook, and I could hear the alteration in his voice as he said, “Not\\nJim?”\\n\\n“The very same Jim as ever was,” says Silver.\\n\\nThe doctor stopped outright, although he did not speak, and it was some\\nseconds before he seemed able to move on.\\n\\n“Well, well,” he said at last, “duty first and pleasure afterwards, as\\nyou might have said yourself, Silver. Let us overhaul these patients of\\nyours.”\\n\\nA moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim\\nnod to me proceeded with his work among the sick. He seemed under no\\napprehension, though he must have known that his life, among these\\ntreacherous demons, depended on a hair; and he rattled on to his\\npatients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet\\nEnglish family. His manner, I suppose, reacted on the men, for they\\nbehaved to him as if nothing had occurred, as if he were still ship’s\\ndoctor and they still faithful hands before the mast.\\n\\n“You’re doing well, my friend,” he said to the fellow with the bandaged\\nhead, “and if ever any person had a close shave, it was you; your head\\nmust be as hard as iron. Well, George, how goes it? You’re a pretty\\ncolour, certainly; why, your liver, man, is upside down. Did you take\\nthat medicine? Did he take that medicine, men?”\\n\\n“Aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough,” returned Morgan.\\n\\n“Because, you see, since I am mutineers’ doctor, or prison doctor as I\\nprefer to call it,” says Doctor Livesey in his pleasantest way, “I make\\nit a point of honour not to lose a man for King George (God bless him!)\\nand the gallows.”\\n\\nThe rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in\\nsilence.\\n\\n“Dick don’t feel well, sir,” said one.\\n\\n“Don’t he?” replied the doctor. “Well, step up here, Dick, and let me\\nsee your tongue. No, I should be surprised if he did! The man’s tongue\\nis fit to frighten the French. Another fever.”\\n\\n“Ah, there,” said Morgan, “that comed of sp’iling Bibles.”\\n\\n“That comes--as you call it--of being arrant asses,” retorted the\\ndoctor, “and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison,\\nand the dry land from a vile, pestiferous slough. I think it most\\nprobable--though of course it’s only an opinion--that you’ll all have\\nthe deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems. Camp\\nin a bog, would you? Silver, I’m surprised at you. You’re less of a fool\\nthan many, take you all round; but you don’t appear to me to have the\\nrudiments of a notion of the rules of health.\\n\\n“Well,” he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken\\nhis prescriptions, with really laughable humility, more like charity\\nschoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and pirates--“well, that’s\\ndone for today. And now I should wish to have a talk with that boy,\\nplease.”\\n\\nAnd he nodded his head in my direction carelessly.\\n\\nGeorge Merry was at the door, spitting and spluttering over some\\nbad-tasted medicine; but at the first word of the doctor’s proposal he\\nswung round with a deep flush and cried “No!” and swore.\\n\\nSilver struck the barrel with his open hand.\\n\\n“Si-lence!” he roared and looked about him positively like a lion.\\n“Doctor,” he went on in his usual tones, “I was a-thinking of that,\\nknowing as how you had a fancy for the boy. We’re all humbly grateful\\nfor your kindness, and as you see, puts faith in you and takes the drugs\\ndown like that much grog. And I take it I’ve found a way as’ll suit all.\\nHawkins, will you give me your word of honour as a young gentleman--for\\na young gentleman you are, although poor born--your word of honour not\\nto slip your cable?”\\n\\nI readily gave the pledge required.\\n\\n“Then, doctor,” said Silver, “you just step outside o’ that stockade,\\nand once you’re there I’ll bring the boy down on the inside, and I\\nreckon you can yarn through the spars. Good day to you, sir, and all our\\ndooties to the squire and Cap’n Smollett.”\\n\\nThe explosion of disapproval, which nothing but Silver’s black looks had\\nrestrained, broke out immediately the doctor had left the house. Silver\\nwas roundly accused of playing double--of trying to make a separate\\npeace for himself, of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and\\nvictims, and, in one word, of the identical, exact thing that he was\\ndoing. It seemed to me so obvious, in this case, that I could not\\nimagine how he was to turn their anger. But he was twice the man\\nthe rest were, and his last night’s victory had given him a huge\\npreponderance on their minds. He called them all the fools and dolts\\nyou can imagine, said it was necessary I should talk to the doctor,\\nfluttered the chart in their faces, asked them if they could afford to\\nbreak the treaty the very day they were bound a-treasure-hunting.\\n\\n“No, by thunder!” he cried. “It’s us must break the treaty when the time\\ncomes; and till then I’ll gammon that doctor, if I have to ile his boots\\nwith brandy.”\\n\\nAnd then he bade them get the fire lit, and stalked out upon his crutch,\\nwith his hand on my shoulder, leaving them in a disarray, and silenced\\nby his volubility rather than convinced.\\n\\n“Slow, lad, slow,” he said. “They might round upon us in a twinkle of an\\neye if we was seen to hurry.”\\n\\nVery deliberately, then, did we advance across the sand to where the\\ndoctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade, and as soon as we\\nwere within easy speaking distance Silver stopped.\\n\\n“You’ll make a note of this here also, doctor,” says he, “and the boy’ll\\ntell you how I saved his life, and were deposed for it too, and you\\nmay lay to that. Doctor, when a man’s steering as near the wind as\\nme--playing chuck-farthing with the last breath in his body, like--you\\nwouldn’t think it too much, mayhap, to give him one good word? You’ll\\nplease bear in mind it’s not my life only now--it’s that boy’s into the\\nbargain; and you’ll speak me fair, doctor, and give me a bit o’ hope to\\ngo on, for the sake of mercy.”\\n\\nSilver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his\\nfriends and the block house; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in, his\\nvoice trembled; never was a soul more dead in earnest.\\n\\n“Why, John, you’re not afraid?” asked Dr. Livesey.\\n\\n“Doctor, I’m no coward; no, not I--not SO much!” and he snapped his\\nfingers. “If I was I wouldn’t say it. But I’ll own up fairly, I’ve the\\nshakes upon me for the gallows. You’re a good man and a true; I never\\nseen a better man! And you’ll not forget what I done good, not any more\\nthan you’ll forget the bad, I know. And I step aside--see here--and\\nleave you and Jim alone. And you’ll put that down for me too, for it’s a\\nlong stretch, is that!”\\n\\nSo saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of earshot, and\\nthere sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle, spinning round\\nnow and again upon his seat so as to command a sight, sometimes of me\\nand the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and\\nfro in the sand between the fire--which they were busy rekindling--and\\nthe house, from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the\\nbreakfast.\\n\\n“So, Jim,” said the doctor sadly, “here you are. As you have brewed, so\\nshall you drink, my boy. Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to\\nblame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain\\nSmollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and\\ncouldn’t help it, by George, it was downright cowardly!”\\n\\nI will own that I here began to weep. “Doctor,” I said, “you might spare\\nme. I have blamed myself enough; my life’s forfeit anyway, and I should\\nhave been dead by now if Silver hadn’t stood for me; and doctor,\\nbelieve this, I can die--and I dare say I deserve it--but what I fear is\\ntorture. If they come to torture me--”\\n\\n“Jim,” the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, “Jim, I\\ncan’t have this. Whip over, and we’ll run for it.”\\n\\n“Doctor,” said I, “I passed my word.”\\n\\n“I know, I know,” he cried. “We can’t help that, Jim, now. I’ll take it\\non my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here,\\nI cannot let you. Jump! One jump, and you’re out, and we’ll run for it\\nlike antelopes.”\\n\\n“No,” I replied; “you know right well you wouldn’t do the thing\\nyourself--neither you nor squire nor captain; and no more will I. Silver\\ntrusted me; I passed my word, and back I go. But, doctor, you did not\\nlet me finish. If they come to torture me, I might let slip a word of\\nwhere the ship is, for I got the ship, part by luck and part by risking,\\nand she lies in North Inlet, on the southern beach, and just below high\\nwater. At half tide she must be high and dry.”\\n\\n“The ship!” exclaimed the doctor.\\n\\nRapidly I described to him my adventures, and he heard me out in\\nsilence.\\n\\n“There is a kind of fate in this,” he observed when I had done. “Every\\nstep, it’s you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by any chance\\nthat we are going to let you lose yours? That would be a poor return, my\\nboy. You found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn--the best deed that\\never you did, or will do, though you live to ninety. Oh, by Jupiter, and\\ntalking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief in person. Silver!” he\\ncried. “Silver! I’ll give you a piece of advice,” he continued as\\nthe cook drew near again; “don’t you be in any great hurry after that\\ntreasure.”\\n\\n“Why, sir, I do my possible, which that ain’t,” said Silver. “I can\\nonly, asking your pardon, save my life and the boy’s by seeking for that\\ntreasure; and you may lay to that.”\\n\\n“Well, Silver,” replied the doctor, “if that is so, I’ll go one step\\nfurther: look out for squalls when you find it.”\\n\\n“Sir,” said Silver, “as between man and man, that’s too much and too\\nlittle. What you’re after, why you left the block house, why you given\\nme that there chart, I don’t know, now, do I? And yet I done your\\nbidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here’s\\ntoo much. If you won’t tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and\\nI’ll leave the helm.”\\n\\n“No,” said the doctor musingly; “I’ve no right to say more; it’s not my\\nsecret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I’d tell it you. But\\nI’ll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I’ll have\\nmy wig sorted by the captain or I’m mistaken! And first, I’ll give you a\\nbit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I’ll do\\nmy best to save you, short of perjury.”\\n\\nSilver’s face was radiant. “You couldn’t say more, I’m sure, sir, not if\\nyou was my mother,” he cried.\\n\\n“Well, that’s my first concession,” added the doctor. “My second is a\\npiece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help,\\nhalloo. I’m off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I\\nspeak at random. Good-bye, Jim.”\\n\\nAnd Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to\\nSilver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\nThe Treasure-hunt--Flint’s Pointer\\n\\n“JIM,” said Silver when we were alone, “if I saved your life, you saved\\nmine; and I’ll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for\\nit--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as\\nhearing. Jim, that’s one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had\\nsince the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we’re to go in\\nfor this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don’t like\\nit; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we’ll save\\nour necks in spite o’ fate and fortune.”\\n\\nJust then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and\\nwe were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried\\njunk. They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox, and it was now grown so\\nhot that they could only approach it from the windward, and even there\\nnot without precaution. In the same wasteful spirit, they had cooked,\\nI suppose, three times more than we could eat; and one of them, with an\\nempty laugh, threw what was left into the fire, which blazed and roared\\nagain over this unusual fuel. I never in my life saw men so careless of\\nthe morrow; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way\\nof doing; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries, though they\\nwere bold enough for a brush and be done with it, I could see their\\nentire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign.\\n\\nEven Silver, eating away, with Captain Flint upon his shoulder, had not\\na word of blame for their recklessness. And this the more surprised me,\\nfor I thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then.\\n\\n“Aye, mates,” said he, “it’s lucky you have Barbecue to think for you\\nwith this here head. I got what I wanted, I did. Sure enough, they have\\nthe ship. Where they have it, I don’t know yet; but once we hit the\\ntreasure, we’ll have to jump about and find out. And then, mates, us\\nthat has the boats, I reckon, has the upper hand.”\\n\\nThus he kept running on, with his mouth full of the hot bacon; thus he\\nrestored their hope and confidence, and, I more than suspect, repaired\\nhis own at the same time.\\n\\n“As for hostage,” he continued, “that’s his last talk, I guess, with\\nthem he loves so dear. I’ve got my piece o’ news, and thanky to him\\nfor that; but it’s over and done. I’ll take him in a line when we go\\ntreasure-hunting, for we’ll keep him like so much gold, in case of\\naccidents, you mark, and in the meantime. Once we got the ship and\\ntreasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we’ll talk\\nMr. Hawkins over, we will, and we’ll give him his share, to be sure, for\\nall his kindness.”\\n\\nIt was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I\\nwas horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove\\nfeasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt\\nit. He had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he\\nwould prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from\\nhanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side.\\n\\nNay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith\\nwith Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us! What a moment\\nthat would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty\\nand he and I should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and I a\\nboy--against five strong and active seamen!\\n\\nAdd to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the\\nbehaviour of my friends, their unexplained desertion of the stockade,\\ntheir inexplicable cession of the chart, or harder still to understand,\\nthe doctor’s last warning to Silver, “Look out for squalls when you\\nfind it,” and you will readily believe how little taste I found in my\\nbreakfast and with how uneasy a heart I set forth behind my captors on\\nthe quest for treasure.\\n\\nWe made a curious figure, had anyone been there to see us--all in soiled\\nsailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth. Silver had two guns\\nslung about him--one before and one behind--besides the great cutlass\\nat his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his square-tailed coat.\\nTo complete his strange appearance, Captain Flint sat perched upon his\\nshoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless sea-talk. I had a\\nline about my waist and followed obediently after the sea-cook, who\\nheld the loose end of the rope, now in his free hand, now between his\\npowerful teeth. For all the world, I was led like a dancing bear.\\n\\nThe other men were variously burthened, some carrying picks and\\nshovels--for that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore\\nfrom the HISPANIOLA--others laden with pork, bread, and brandy for the\\nmidday meal. All the stores, I observed, came from our stock, and I\\ncould see the truth of Silver’s words the night before. Had he not\\nstruck a bargain with the doctor, he and his mutineers, deserted by the\\nship, must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds\\nof their hunting. Water would have been little to their taste; a sailor\\nis not usually a good shot; and besides all that, when they were so\\nshort of eatables, it was not likely they would be very flush of powder.\\n\\nWell, thus equipped, we all set out--even the fellow with the broken\\nhead, who should certainly have kept in shadow--and straggled, one after\\nanother, to the beach, where the two gigs awaited us. Even these bore\\ntrace of the drunken folly of the pirates, one in a broken thwart, and\\nboth in their muddy and unbailed condition. Both were to be carried\\nalong with us for the sake of safety; and so, with our numbers divided\\nbetween them, we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage.\\n\\nAs we pulled over, there was some discussion on the chart. The red cross\\nwas, of course, far too large to be a guide; and the terms of the note\\non the back, as you will hear, admitted of some ambiguity. They ran, the\\nreader may remember, thus:\\n\\n     Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to\\n     the N. of N.N.E.\\n     Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.\\n     Ten feet.\\n\\nA tall tree was thus the principal mark. Now, right before us the\\nanchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high,\\nadjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the Spy-glass\\nand rising again towards the south into the rough, cliffy eminence\\ncalled the Mizzen-mast Hill. The top of the plateau was dotted thickly\\nwith pine-trees of varying height. Every here and there, one of a\\ndifferent species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours,\\nand which of these was the particular “tall tree” of Captain Flint could\\nonly be decided on the spot, and by the readings of the compass.\\n\\nYet, although that was the case, every man on board the boats had\\npicked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over, Long John alone\\nshrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there.\\n\\nWe pulled easily, by Silver’s directions, not to weary the hands\\nprematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of\\nthe second river--that which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass.\\nThence, bending to our left, we began to ascend the slope towards the\\nplateau.\\n\\nAt the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish vegetation\\ngreatly delayed our progress; but by little and little the hill began\\nto steepen and become stony under foot, and the wood to change its\\ncharacter and to grow in a more open order. It was, indeed, a most\\npleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching. A\\nheavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place\\nof grass. Thickets of green nutmeg-trees were dotted here and there with\\nthe red columns and the broad shadow of the pines; and the first mingled\\ntheir spice with the aroma of the others. The air, besides, was fresh\\nand stirring, and this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a wonderful\\nrefreshment to our senses.\\n\\nThe party spread itself abroad, in a fan shape, shouting and leaping to\\nand fro. About the centre, and a good way behind the rest, Silver and\\nI followed--I tethered by my rope, he ploughing, with deep pants, among\\nthe sliding gravel. From time to time, indeed, I had to lend him a hand,\\nor he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill.\\n\\nWe had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the\\nbrow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry\\naloud, as if in terror. Shout after shout came from him, and the others\\nbegan to run in his direction.\\n\\n“He can’t ’a found the treasure,” said old Morgan, hurrying past us from\\nthe right, “for that’s clean a-top.”\\n\\nIndeed, as we found when we also reached the spot, it was something\\nvery different. At the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green\\ncreeper, which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones, a human\\nskeleton lay, with a few shreds of clothing, on the ground. I believe a\\nchill struck for a moment to every heart.\\n\\n“He was a seaman,” said George Merry, who, bolder than the rest, had\\ngone up close and was examining the rags of clothing. “Leastways, this\\nis good sea-cloth.”\\n\\n“Aye, aye,” said Silver; “like enough; you wouldn’t look to find a\\nbishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie?\\n’Tain’t in natur’.”\\n\\nIndeed, on a second glance, it seemed impossible to fancy that the body\\nwas in a natural position. But for some disarray (the work, perhaps, of\\nthe birds that had fed upon him or of the slow-growing creeper that had\\ngradually enveloped his remains) the man lay perfectly straight--his\\nfeet pointing in one direction, his hands, raised above his head like a\\ndiver’s, pointing directly in the opposite.\\n\\n“I’ve taken a notion into my old numbskull,” observed Silver. “Here’s\\nthe compass; there’s the tip-top p’int o’ Skeleton Island, stickin’\\nout like a tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, along the line of them\\nbones.”\\n\\nIt was done. The body pointed straight in the direction of the island,\\nand the compass read duly E.S.E. and by E.\\n\\n“I thought so,” cried the cook; “this here is a p’inter. Right up there\\nis our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars. But, by thunder!\\nIf it don’t make me cold inside to think of Flint. This is one of HIS\\njokes, and no mistake. Him and these six was alone here; he killed ’em,\\nevery man; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass, shiver\\nmy timbers! They’re long bones, and the hair’s been yellow. Aye, that\\nwould be Allardyce. You mind Allardyce, Tom Morgan?”\\n\\n“Aye, aye,” returned Morgan; “I mind him; he owed me money, he did, and\\ntook my knife ashore with him.”\\n\\n“Speaking of knives,” said another, “why don’t we find his’n lying\\nround? Flint warn’t the man to pick a seaman’s pocket; and the birds, I\\nguess, would leave it be.”\\n\\n“By the powers, and that’s true!” cried Silver.\\n\\n“There ain’t a thing left here,” said Merry, still feeling round among\\nthe bones; “not a copper doit nor a baccy box. It don’t look nat’ral to\\nme.”\\n\\n“No, by gum, it don’t,” agreed Silver; “not nat’ral, nor not nice, says\\nyou. Great guns! Messmates, but if Flint was living, this would be a hot\\nspot for you and me. Six they were, and six are we; and bones is what\\nthey are now.”\\n\\n“I saw him dead with these here deadlights,” said Morgan. “Billy took me\\nin. There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes.”\\n\\n“Dead--aye, sure enough he’s dead and gone below,” said the fellow with\\nthe bandage; “but if ever sperrit walked, it would be Flint’s. Dear\\nheart, but he died bad, did Flint!”\\n\\n“Aye, that he did,” observed another; “now he raged, and now he hollered\\nfor the rum, and now he sang. ‘Fifteen Men’ were his only song, mates;\\nand I tell you true, I never rightly liked to hear it since. It was\\nmain hot, and the windy was open, and I hear that old song comin’ out as\\nclear as clear--and the death-haul on the man already.”\\n\\n“Come, come,” said Silver; “stow this talk. He’s dead, and he don’t\\nwalk, that I know; leastways, he won’t walk by day, and you may lay to\\nthat. Care killed a cat. Fetch ahead for the doubloons.”\\n\\nWe started, certainly; but in spite of the hot sun and the staring\\ndaylight, the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the\\nwood, but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath. The terror of\\nthe dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n32\\n\\nThe Treasure-hunt--The Voice Among the Trees\\n\\nPARTLY from the damping influence of this alarm, partly to rest Silver\\nand the sick folk, the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained\\nthe brow of the ascent.\\n\\nThe plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west, this spot on which\\nwe had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand. Before us,\\nover the tree-tops, we beheld the Cape of the Woods fringed with surf;\\nbehind, we not only looked down upon the anchorage and Skeleton Island,\\nbut saw--clear across the spit and the eastern lowlands--a great field\\nof open sea upon the east. Sheer above us rose the Spyglass, here dotted\\nwith single pines, there black with precipices. There was no sound but\\nthat of the distant breakers, mounting from all round, and the chirp of\\ncountless insects in the brush. Not a man, not a sail, upon the sea; the\\nvery largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude.\\n\\nSilver, as he sat, took certain bearings with his compass.\\n\\n“There are three ‘tall trees’” said he, “about in the right line from\\nSkeleton Island. ‘Spy-glass shoulder,’ I take it, means that lower p’int\\nthere. It’s child’s play to find the stuff now. I’ve half a mind to dine\\nfirst.”\\n\\n“I don’t feel sharp,” growled Morgan. “Thinkin’ o’ Flint--I think it\\nwere--as done me.”\\n\\n“Ah, well, my son, you praise your stars he’s dead,” said Silver.\\n\\n“He were an ugly devil,” cried a third pirate with a shudder; “that blue\\nin the face too!”\\n\\n“That was how the rum took him,” added Merry. “Blue! Well, I reckon he\\nwas blue. That’s a true word.”\\n\\nEver since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of\\nthought, they had spoken lower and lower, and they had almost got to\\nwhispering by now, so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted\\nthe silence of the wood. All of a sudden, out of the middle of the trees\\nin front of us, a thin, high, trembling voice struck up the well-known\\nair and words:\\n\\n     “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest--\\n     Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”\\n\\nI never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates. The\\ncolour went from their six faces like enchantment; some leaped to their\\nfeet, some clawed hold of others; Morgan grovelled on the ground.\\n\\n“It’s Flint, by ----!” cried Merry.\\n\\nThe song had stopped as suddenly as it began--broken off, you would have\\nsaid, in the middle of a note, as though someone had laid his hand upon\\nthe singer’s mouth. Coming through the clear, sunny atmosphere among the\\ngreen tree-tops, I thought it had sounded airily and sweetly; and the\\neffect on my companions was the stranger.\\n\\n“Come,” said Silver, struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out;\\n“this won’t do. Stand by to go about. This is a rum start, and I can’t\\nname the voice, but it’s someone skylarking--someone that’s flesh and\\nblood, and you may lay to that.”\\n\\nHis courage had come back as he spoke, and some of the colour to his\\nface along with it. Already the others had begun to lend an ear to this\\nencouragement and were coming a little to themselves, when the same\\nvoice broke out again--not this time singing, but in a faint distant\\nhail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the Spy-glass.\\n\\n“Darby M’Graw,” it wailed--for that is the word that best describes the\\nsound--“Darby M’Graw! Darby M’Graw!” again and again and again; and then\\nrising a little higher, and with an oath that I leave out: “Fetch aft\\nthe rum, Darby!”\\n\\nThe buccaneers remained rooted to the ground, their eyes starting from\\ntheir heads. Long after the voice had died away they still stared in\\nsilence, dreadfully, before them.\\n\\n“That fixes it!” gasped one. “Let’s go.”\\n\\n“They was his last words,” moaned Morgan, “his last words above board.”\\n\\nDick had his Bible out and was praying volubly. He had been well brought\\nup, had Dick, before he came to sea and fell among bad companions.\\n\\nStill Silver was unconquered. I could hear his teeth rattle in his head,\\nbut he had not yet surrendered.\\n\\n“Nobody in this here island ever heard of Darby,” he muttered; “not one\\nbut us that’s here.” And then, making a great effort: “Shipmates,”\\n he cried, “I’m here to get that stuff, and I’ll not be beat by man or\\ndevil. I never was feared of Flint in his life, and, by the powers, I’ll\\nface him dead. There’s seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a\\nmile from here. When did ever a gentleman o’ fortune show his stern to\\nthat much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mug--and him dead\\ntoo?”\\n\\nBut there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers, rather,\\nindeed, of growing terror at the irreverence of his words.\\n\\n“Belay there, John!” said Merry. “Don’t you cross a sperrit.”\\n\\nAnd the rest were all too terrified to reply. They would have run away\\nseverally had they dared; but fear kept them together, and kept them\\nclose by John, as if his daring helped them. He, on his part, had pretty\\nwell fought his weakness down.\\n\\n“Sperrit? Well, maybe,” he said. “But there’s one thing not clear to me.\\nThere was an echo. Now, no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow; well\\nthen, what’s he doing with an echo to him, I should like to know? That\\nain’t in natur’, surely?”\\n\\nThis argument seemed weak enough to me. But you can never tell what will\\naffect the superstitious, and to my wonder, George Merry was greatly\\nrelieved.\\n\\n“Well, that’s so,” he said. “You’ve a head upon your shoulders, John,\\nand no mistake. ’Bout ship, mates! This here crew is on a wrong tack, I\\ndo believe. And come to think on it, it was like Flint’s voice, I\\ngrant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all. It was liker\\nsomebody else’s voice now--it was liker--”\\n\\n“By the powers, Ben Gunn!” roared Silver.\\n\\n“Aye, and so it were,” cried Morgan, springing on his knees. “Ben Gunn\\nit were!”\\n\\n“It don’t make much odds, do it, now?” asked Dick. “Ben Gunn’s not here\\nin the body any more’n Flint.”\\n\\nBut the older hands greeted this remark with scorn.\\n\\n“Why, nobody minds Ben Gunn,” cried Merry; “dead or alive, nobody minds\\nhim.”\\n\\nIt was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural\\ncolour had revived in their faces. Soon they were chatting together,\\nwith intervals of listening; and not long after, hearing no further\\nsound, they shouldered the tools and set forth again, Merry walking\\nfirst with Silver’s compass to keep them on the right line with Skeleton\\nIsland. He had said the truth: dead or alive, nobody minded Ben Gunn.\\n\\nDick alone still held his Bible, and looked around him as he went, with\\nfearful glances; but he found no sympathy, and Silver even joked him on\\nhis precautions.\\n\\n“I told you,” said he--“I told you you had sp’iled your Bible. If it\\nain’t no good to swear by, what do you suppose a sperrit would give for\\nit? Not that!” and he snapped his big fingers, halting a moment on his\\ncrutch.\\n\\nBut Dick was not to be comforted; indeed, it was soon plain to me that\\nthe lad was falling sick; hastened by heat, exhaustion, and the shock\\nof his alarm, the fever, predicted by Dr. Livesey, was evidently growing\\nswiftly higher.\\n\\nIt was fine open walking here, upon the summit; our way lay a little\\ndownhill, for, as I have said, the plateau tilted towards the west. The\\npines, great and small, grew wide apart; and even between the clumps of\\nnutmeg and azalea, wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine. Striking,\\nas we did, pretty near north-west across the island, we drew, on the\\none hand, ever nearer under the shoulders of the Spy-glass, and on the\\nother, looked ever wider over that western bay where I had once tossed\\nand trembled in the coracle.\\n\\nThe first of the tall trees was reached, and by the bearings proved the\\nwrong one. So with the second. The third rose nearly two hundred feet\\ninto the air above a clump of underwood--a giant of a vegetable, with\\na red column as big as a cottage, and a wide shadow around in which a\\ncompany could have manoeuvred. It was conspicuous far to sea both on\\nthe east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the\\nchart.\\n\\nBut it was not its size that now impressed my companions; it was the\\nknowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere\\nburied below its spreading shadow. The thought of the money, as they\\ndrew nearer, swallowed up their previous terrors. Their eyes burned in\\ntheir heads; their feet grew speedier and lighter; their whole soul\\nwas bound up in that fortune, that whole lifetime of extravagance and\\npleasure, that lay waiting there for each of them.\\n\\nSilver hobbled, grunting, on his crutch; his nostrils stood out and\\nquivered; he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and\\nshiny countenance; he plucked furiously at the line that held me to\\nhim and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look.\\nCertainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts, and certainly I read\\nthem like print. In the immediate nearness of the gold, all else had\\nbeen forgotten: his promise and the doctor’s warning were both things\\nof the past, and I could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the\\ntreasure, find and board the HISPANIOLA under cover of night, cut\\nevery honest throat about that island, and sail away as he had at first\\nintended, laden with crimes and riches.\\n\\nShaken as I was with these alarms, it was hard for me to keep up with\\nthe rapid pace of the treasure-hunters. Now and again I stumbled, and it\\nwas then that Silver plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me\\nhis murderous glances. Dick, who had dropped behind us and now brought\\nup the rear, was babbling to himself both prayers and curses as his\\nfever kept rising. This also added to my wretchedness, and to crown all,\\nI was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted\\non that plateau, when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue face--he who\\ndied at Savannah, singing and shouting for drink--had there, with his\\nown hand, cut down his six accomplices. This grove that was now so\\npeaceful must then have rung with cries, I thought; and even with the\\nthought I could believe I heard it ringing still.\\n\\nWe were now at the margin of the thicket.\\n\\n“Huzza, mates, all together!” shouted Merry; and the foremost broke into\\na run.\\n\\nAnd suddenly, not ten yards further, we beheld them stop. A low cry\\narose. Silver doubled his pace, digging away with the foot of his crutch\\nlike one possessed; and next moment he and I had come also to a dead\\nhalt.\\n\\nBefore us was a great excavation, not very recent, for the sides had\\nfallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom. In this were the shaft\\nof a pick broken in two and the boards of several packing-cases strewn\\naround. On one of these boards I saw, branded with a hot iron, the name\\nWALRUS--the name of Flint’s ship.\\n\\nAll was clear to probation. The CACHE had been found and rifled; the\\nseven hundred thousand pounds were gone!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n33\\n\\nThe Fall of a Chieftain\\n\\nTHERE never was such an overturn in this world. Each of these six men\\nwas as though he had been struck. But with Silver the blow passed almost\\ninstantly. Every thought of his soul had been set full-stretch, like a\\nracer, on that money; well, he was brought up, in a single second, dead;\\nand he kept his head, found his temper, and changed his plan before the\\nothers had had time to realize the disappointment.\\n\\n“Jim,” he whispered, “take that, and stand by for trouble.”\\n\\nAnd he passed me a double-barrelled pistol.\\n\\nAt the same time, he began quietly moving northward, and in a few steps\\nhad put the hollow between us two and the other five. Then he looked at\\nme and nodded, as much as to say, “Here is a narrow corner,” as, indeed,\\nI thought it was. His looks were not quite friendly, and I was so\\nrevolted at these constant changes that I could not forbear whispering,\\n“So you’ve changed sides again.”\\n\\nThere was no time left for him to answer in. The buccaneers, with oaths\\nand cries, began to leap, one after another, into the pit and to dig\\nwith their fingers, throwing the boards aside as they did so. Morgan\\nfound a piece of gold. He held it up with a perfect spout of oaths. It\\nwas a two-guinea piece, and it went from hand to hand among them for a\\nquarter of a minute.\\n\\n“Two guineas!” roared Merry, shaking it at Silver. “That’s your seven\\nhundred thousand pounds, is it? You’re the man for bargains, ain’t you?\\nYou’re him that never bungled nothing, you wooden-headed lubber!”\\n\\n“Dig away, boys,” said Silver with the coolest insolence; “you’ll find\\nsome pig-nuts and I shouldn’t wonder.”\\n\\n“Pig-nuts!” repeated Merry, in a scream. “Mates, do you hear that? I\\ntell you now, that man there knew it all along. Look in the face of him\\nand you’ll see it wrote there.”\\n\\n“Ah, Merry,” remarked Silver, “standing for cap’n again? You’re a\\npushing lad, to be sure.”\\n\\nBut this time everyone was entirely in Merry’s favour. They began to\\nscramble out of the excavation, darting furious glances behind them. One\\nthing I observed, which looked well for us: they all got out upon the\\nopposite side from Silver.\\n\\nWell, there we stood, two on one side, five on the other, the pit\\nbetween us, and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow.\\nSilver never moved; he watched them, very upright on his crutch, and\\nlooked as cool as ever I saw him. He was brave, and no mistake.\\n\\nAt last Merry seemed to think a speech might help matters.\\n\\n“Mates,” says he, “there’s two of them alone there; one’s the old\\ncripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this; the\\nother’s that cub that I mean to have the heart of. Now, mates--”\\n\\nHe was raising his arm and his voice, and plainly meant to lead a\\ncharge. But just then--crack! crack! crack!--three musket-shots flashed\\nout of the thicket. Merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation; the\\nman with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length\\nupon his side, where he lay dead, but still twitching; and the other\\nthree turned and ran for it with all their might.\\n\\nBefore you could wink, Long John had fired two barrels of a pistol into\\nthe struggling Merry, and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the\\nlast agony, “George,” said he, “I reckon I settled you.”\\n\\nAt the same moment, the doctor, Gray, and Ben Gunn joined us, with\\nsmoking muskets, from among the nutmeg-trees.\\n\\n“Forward!” cried the doctor. “Double quick, my lads. We must head ’em\\noff the boats.”\\n\\nAnd we set off at a great pace, sometimes plunging through the bushes to\\nthe chest.\\n\\nI tell you, but Silver was anxious to keep up with us. The work that man\\nwent through, leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were\\nfit to burst, was work no sound man ever equalled; and so thinks the\\ndoctor. As it was, he was already thirty yards behind us and on the\\nverge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope.\\n\\n“Doctor,” he hailed, “see there! No hurry!”\\n\\nSure enough there was no hurry. In a more open part of the plateau, we\\ncould see the three survivors still running in the same direction as\\nthey had started, right for Mizzenmast Hill. We were already between\\nthem and the boats; and so we four sat down to breathe, while Long John,\\nmopping his face, came slowly up with us.\\n\\n“Thank ye kindly, doctor,” says he. “You came in in about the nick, I\\nguess, for me and Hawkins. And so it’s you, Ben Gunn!” he added. “Well,\\nyou’re a nice one, to be sure.”\\n\\n“I’m Ben Gunn, I am,” replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his\\nembarrassment. “And,” he added, after a long pause, “how do, Mr. Silver?\\nPretty well, I thank ye, says you.”\\n\\n“Ben, Ben,” murmured Silver, “to think as you’ve done me!”\\n\\nThe doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their\\nflight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to\\nwhere the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place.\\nIt was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the\\nhalf-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end.\\n\\nBen, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the\\nskeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he\\nhad dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the\\nexcavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from\\nthe foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at\\nthe north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in\\nsafety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA.\\n\\nWhen the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the\\nattack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone\\nto Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the\\nstores, for Ben Gunn’s cave was well supplied with goats’ meat salted\\nby himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in\\nsafety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of\\nmalaria and keep a guard upon the money.\\n\\n“As for you, Jim,” he said, “it went against my heart, but I did what I\\nthought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if you were not\\none of these, whose fault was it?”\\n\\nThat morning, finding that I was to be involved in the horrid\\ndisappointment he had prepared for the mutineers, he had run all the way\\nto the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain, had taken Gray\\nand the maroon and started, making the diagonal across the island to be\\nat hand beside the pine. Soon, however, he saw that our party had the\\nstart of him; and Ben Gunn, being fleet of foot, had been dispatched in\\nfront to do his best alone. Then it had occurred to him to work upon the\\nsuperstitions of his former shipmates, and he was so far successful that\\nGray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the\\narrival of the treasure-hunters.\\n\\n“Ah,” said Silver, “it were fortunate for me that I had Hawkins here.\\nYou would have let old John be cut to bits, and never given it a\\nthought, doctor.”\\n\\n“Not a thought,” replied Dr. Livesey cheerily.\\n\\nAnd by this time we had reached the gigs. The doctor, with the pick-axe,\\ndemolished one of them, and then we all got aboard the other and set out\\nto go round by sea for North Inlet.\\n\\nThis was a run of eight or nine miles. Silver, though he was almost\\nkilled already with fatigue, was set to an oar, like the rest of us, and\\nwe were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea. Soon we passed out\\nof the straits and doubled the south-east corner of the island, round\\nwhich, four days ago, we had towed the HISPANIOLA.\\n\\nAs we passed the two-pointed hill, we could see the black mouth of Ben\\nGunn’s cave and a figure standing by it, leaning on a musket. It was the\\nsquire, and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers, in which\\nthe voice of Silver joined as heartily as any.\\n\\nThree miles farther, just inside the mouth of North Inlet, what should\\nwe meet but the HISPANIOLA, cruising by herself? The last flood had\\nlifted her, and had there been much wind or a strong tide current, as\\nin the southern anchorage, we should never have found her more, or found\\nher stranded beyond help. As it was, there was little amiss beyond the\\nwreck of the main-sail. Another anchor was got ready and dropped in a\\nfathom and a half of water. We all pulled round again to Rum Cove,\\nthe nearest point for Ben Gunn’s treasure-house; and then Gray,\\nsingle-handed, returned with the gig to the HISPANIOLA, where he was to\\npass the night on guard.\\n\\nA gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave. At the\\ntop, the squire met us. To me he was cordial and kind, saying nothing\\nof my escapade either in the way of blame or praise. At Silver’s polite\\nsalute he somewhat flushed.\\n\\n“John Silver,” he said, “you’re a prodigious villain and imposter--a\\nmonstrous imposter, sir. I am told I am not to prosecute you. Well,\\nthen, I will not. But the dead men, sir, hang about your neck like\\nmill-stones.”\\n\\n“Thank you kindly, sir,” replied Long John, again saluting.\\n\\n“I dare you to thank me!” cried the squire. “It is a gross dereliction\\nof my duty. Stand back.”\\n\\nAnd thereupon we all entered the cave. It was a large, airy place, with\\na little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung with ferns. The\\nfloor was sand. Before a big fire lay Captain Smollett; and in a far\\ncorner, only duskily flickered over by the blaze, I beheld great heaps\\nof coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold. That was Flint’s\\ntreasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the\\nlives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA. How many it had cost in the\\namassing, what blood and sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep,\\nwhat brave men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what\\nshame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell. Yet there\\nwere still three upon that island--Silver, and old Morgan, and Ben\\nGunn--who had each taken his share in these crimes, as each had hoped in\\nvain to share in the reward.\\n\\n“Come in, Jim,” said the captain. “You’re a good boy in your line, Jim,\\nbut I don’t think you and me’ll go to sea again. You’re too much of the\\nborn favourite for me. Is that you, John Silver? What brings you here,\\nman?”\\n\\n“Come back to my dooty, sir,” returned Silver.\\n\\n“Ah!” said the captain, and that was all he said.\\n\\nWhat a supper I had of it that night, with all my friends around me; and\\nwhat a meal it was, with Ben Gunn’s salted goat and some delicacies and\\na bottle of old wine from the HISPANIOLA. Never, I am sure, were people\\ngayer or happier. And there was Silver, sitting back almost out of the\\nfirelight, but eating heartily, prompt to spring forward when anything\\nwas wanted, even joining quietly in our laughter--the same bland,\\npolite, obsequious seaman of the voyage out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\nAnd Last\\n\\nTHE next morning we fell early to work, for the transportation of this\\ngreat mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach, and thence three\\nmiles by boat to the HISPANIOLA, was a considerable task for so small\\na number of workmen. The three fellows still abroad upon the island did\\nnot greatly trouble us; a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was\\nsufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught, and we thought,\\nbesides, they had had more than enough of fighting.\\n\\nTherefore the work was pushed on briskly. Gray and Ben Gunn came and\\nwent with the boat, while the rest during their absences piled treasure\\non the beach. Two of the bars, slung in a rope’s end, made a good load\\nfor a grown man--one that he was glad to walk slowly with. For my part,\\nas I was not much use at carrying, I was kept busy all day in the cave\\npacking the minted money into bread-bags.\\n\\nIt was a strange collection, like Billy Bones’s hoard for the diversity\\nof coinage, but so much larger and so much more varied that I think I\\nnever had more pleasure than in sorting them. English, French, Spanish,\\nPortuguese, Georges, and Louises, doubloons and double guineas and\\nmoidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the\\nlast hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked\\nlike wisps of string or bits of spider’s web, round pieces and square\\npieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to wear them round\\nyour neck--nearly every variety of money in the world must, I think,\\nhave found a place in that collection; and for number, I am sure they\\nwere like autumn leaves, so that my back ached with stooping and my\\nfingers with sorting them out.\\n\\nDay after day this work went on; by every evening a fortune had been\\nstowed aboard, but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow; and\\nall this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers.\\n\\nAt last--I think it was on the third night--the doctor and I were\\nstrolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of\\nthe isle, when, from out the thick darkness below, the wind brought us\\na noise between shrieking and singing. It was only a snatch that reached\\nour ears, followed by the former silence.\\n\\n“Heaven forgive them,” said the doctor; “’tis the mutineers!”\\n\\n“All drunk, sir,” struck in the voice of Silver from behind us.\\n\\nSilver, I should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and in spite of\\ndaily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged\\nand friendly dependent. Indeed, it was remarkable how well he bore\\nthese slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to\\ningratiate himself with all. Yet, I think, none treated him better than\\na dog, unless it was Ben Gunn, who was still terribly afraid of his old\\nquartermaster, or myself, who had really something to thank him for;\\nalthough for that matter, I suppose, I had reason to think even worse of\\nhim than anybody else, for I had seen him meditating a fresh treachery\\nupon the plateau. Accordingly, it was pretty gruffly that the doctor\\nanswered him.\\n\\n“Drunk or raving,” said he.\\n\\n“Right you were, sir,” replied Silver; “and precious little odds which,\\nto you and me.”\\n\\n“I suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man,” returned\\nthe doctor with a sneer, “and so my feelings may surprise you, Master\\nSilver. But if I were sure they were raving--as I am morally certain\\none, at least, of them is down with fever--I should leave this camp,\\nand at whatever risk to my own carcass, take them the assistance of my\\nskill.”\\n\\n“Ask your pardon, sir, you would be very wrong,” quoth Silver. “You\\nwould lose your precious life, and you may lay to that. I’m on your side\\nnow, hand and glove; and I shouldn’t wish for to see the party weakened,\\nlet alone yourself, seeing as I know what I owes you. But these men down\\nthere, they couldn’t keep their word--no, not supposing they wished to;\\nand what’s more, they couldn’t believe as you could.”\\n\\n“No,” said the doctor. “You’re the man to keep your word, we know that.”\\n\\nWell, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates. Only\\nonce we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting.\\nA council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the\\nisland--to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong\\napproval of Gray. We left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk\\nof the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools,\\nclothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular\\ndesire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco.\\n\\nThat was about our last doing on the island. Before that, we had got the\\ntreasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the\\ngoat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we\\nweighed anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and stood out\\nof North Inlet, the same colours flying that the captain had flown and\\nfought under at the palisade.\\n\\nThe three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for,\\nas we soon had proved. For coming through the narrows, we had to\\nlie very near the southern point, and there we saw all three of\\nthem kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in\\nsupplication. It went to all our hearts, I think, to leave them in that\\nwretched state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take them\\nhome for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness. The doctor\\nhailed them and told them of the stores we had left, and where they were\\nto find them. But they continued to call us by name and appeal to us,\\nfor God’s sake, to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a\\nplace.\\n\\nAt last, seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly\\ndrawing out of earshot, one of them--I know not which it was--leapt to\\nhis feet with a hoarse cry, whipped his musket to his shoulder, and sent\\na shot whistling over Silver’s head and through the main-sail.\\n\\nAfter that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next I looked\\nout they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself had almost\\nmelted out of sight in the growing distance. That was, at least, the end\\nof that; and before noon, to my inexpressible joy, the highest rock of\\nTreasure Island had sunk into the blue round of sea.\\n\\nWe were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand--only\\nthe captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders, for\\nthough greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet. We laid her\\nhead for the nearest port in Spanish America, for we could not risk the\\nvoyage home without fresh hands; and as it was, what with baffling winds\\nand a couple of fresh gales, we were all worn out before we reached it.\\n\\nIt was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful\\nland-locked gulf, and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full\\nof Negroes and Mexican Indians and half-bloods selling fruits and\\nvegetables and offering to dive for bits of money. The sight of so many\\ngood-humoured faces (especially the blacks), the taste of the tropical\\nfruits, and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a\\nmost charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island;\\nand the doctor and the squire, taking me along with them, went ashore\\nto pass the early part of the night. Here they met the captain of an\\nEnglish man-of-war, fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and,\\nin short, had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came\\nalongside the HISPANIOLA.\\n\\nBen Gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he began,\\nwith wonderful contortions, to make us a confession. Silver was gone.\\nThe maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago,\\nand he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which\\nwould certainly have been forfeit if “that man with the one leg\\nhad stayed aboard.” But this was not all. The sea-cook had not gone\\nempty-handed. He had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed\\none of the sacks of coin, worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas,\\nto help him on his further wanderings.\\n\\nI think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him.\\n\\nWell, to make a long story short, we got a few hands on board, made a\\ngood cruise home, and the HISPANIOLA reached Bristol just as Mr. Blandly\\nwas beginning to think of fitting out her consort. Five men only of\\nthose who had sailed returned with her. “Drink and the devil had done\\nfor the rest,” with a vengeance, although, to be sure, we were not quite\\nin so bad a case as that other ship they sang about:\\n\\n     With one man of her crew alive,\\n     What put to sea with seventy-five.\\n\\nAll of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or\\nfoolishly, according to our natures. Captain Smollett is now retired\\nfrom the sea. Gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit\\nwith the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now\\nmate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the\\nfather of a family. As for Ben Gunn, he got a thousand pounds, which he\\nspent or lost in three weeks, or to be more exact, in nineteen days, for\\nhe was back begging on the twentieth. Then he was given a lodge to keep,\\nexactly as he had feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great\\nfavourite, though something of a butt, with the country boys, and a\\nnotable singer in church on Sundays and saints’ days.\\n\\nOf Silver we have heard no more. That formidable seafaring man with one\\nleg has at last gone clean out of my life; but I dare say he met his old\\nNegress, and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and Captain Flint.\\nIt is to be hoped so, I suppose, for his chances of comfort in another\\nworld are very small.\\n\\nThe bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that I know, where\\nFlint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there for me. Oxen and\\nwain-ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island; and\\nthe worst dreams that ever I have are when I hear the surf booming about\\nits coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of Captain Flint\\nstill ringing in my ears: “Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!”'"
