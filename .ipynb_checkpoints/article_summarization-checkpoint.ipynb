       "'The FDA booster decision shows the process worked: Fauci Dr. Anthony Fauci defended the White House\\'s plan to provide COVID-19 vaccine booster shots before the Food and Drug Administration voted to only provide those shots to Americans 65 and older and immunocompromised. Fauci told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that he was not disappointed by the panel\\'s decision and he thinks the process worked. \"The goal of this particular decision was to prevent people from getting serious disease who are at risk, such as the elderly and those that have underlying conditions,\" he said. When pressed whether the president\\'s premature announcement would confuse Americans, Fauci said that people need to understand that such decisions depend on science and approvals by the appropriate health agencies. \"The plan was that we have to be ready to do this as soon as the decision is made and when you have a plan, you put a date on it and you say we want to be able to get ready to roll out on the week of September the 20th,\" he said. \"So giving that date, I don\\'t think was confusing.\" -ABC News\\' Julia Cherner\\n\\n'"
